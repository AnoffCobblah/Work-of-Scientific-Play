Sir,   — Thb following           memoir having been partially made
known to the         public, I beg you to lay it before your scientific
readers,    as    a means of preventing misrepresentation or piracy.
                           I am, sir,
                                     Your most obedient servant,
Soho   Square,    July   4, 1815.                          ANTHONY CARLISLE'.
   General or comparative anatomy, the great branch of natural
knowledge on which the rationale of medical art is founded, has
lately risen in esteem, and is every day more accurately and
more extensively cultivated.        Considering how intimately the
discoveries of new facts, their relation to each other, and the
physiological inferences to be drawn from them, are connected
with the previous establishment of definite views, of clear intel
ligible terms, and of strict physical methods ; and feeling the
importance of the present subject, I hasten to submit this me
moir to competent judges.        I am aware that premature genera
lization of facts as well as premature inductions from them, are
seldom useful ; and 1 should not have troubled the scientific in
quirer with this communication had I not felt assured that the
present state both of anatomy and physiology would authorise
it.   In my statements      shall purposely avoid all metaphysical

4     Observations relating to the Connexion    between vascular
pretension to dive into the hidden mystery of vitality, confessing
myself wholly incompetent to reduce that power within the rules
of physical science: a power which appears to my judgement as
allied to the nature of an inscrutable First Cause or an emana
tion from it.
    The vast variety in substances, textures, bulk, and combi
nations, which the living animal and vegetable kingdoms ex
hibit, render it difficult to define the essential residence of life
 as connected with any of the modes of organic structure.        Some
 of the compounds and textures of animals are known to        be more
 important for the maintenance of life than others ; as the cerebral
substance and the muscular textures : but there is a numerous
 tribe of living bodies that appear to be wholly destitute of those
 peculiar parts ; of which the entire vegetable kingdom may be
 adduced as an instance.     Habits of meditation and research have
 led me to conclude, that some benefit may arise to physiology
 from more accurate discriminations       between the several sub
 stances of living bodies, especially as to the relative dominion of
 vitality or physical causes on those substances respectively.
     The active phaenomena of life appear to be generally distinct
 from those of physical causation, but the passive condition of
 living substances is not so obvious.     The suspended action of
 torpid animals and vegetables, and the latent vitality of many
 of the more simply constructed animals and vegetables during
 the absence of heat and moisture, show the intimate connexions
 which subsist between vitality and physical causes.     Difficult and
 intricate as these investigations may seem when extended to all
 the cases of vital phaenomena, they are not so in the grosser ex
 amples to be now adduced; and if it should be found that many
 substances distinctly continuous with vital organic bodies are
 wholly subjected to physical dominion, and that several other
 substances are in part influenced by the one cause and bv the
 ether, it may perhaps open new and more precise views in the
 medical art.      Those parts of organic bodies which have no
 power   of self-repair, which hold no continuity with the circula
 ting fluid material destined to replenish the waste, to augment
 the bulk, or repair the accidents of the living fabric, may be
justly deemed extra-vital. The exuvial defences or coverings of
 animals are of this kind ; namely, hairs, nails, feathers, and all
 cuticular structures, as well as the epidermoid coverings and
 husks of the vegetable kingdom : some of those substances which
are destined to be worn away, retain a partial continuity with
 the organic system of circulating fluids, as the growing bulbs of
hairs, the roots and laminae of nails and hoofs ; whilst other parts
which are destined to be shed, as feathers and cuticular scales,
are wholly detached from the vascular communion after their
                                                             complete

    and extra-vascular Substances in living organized Bodies.                 5
complete formation, and only adhere mechanically to the living
parts for a time.
   The most apposite illustrations and the most positive instances
of union between vital and extra-vital parts are to be found in
the testaceous tribe of animals.              After a long continued ami
careful investigation, I am fully convinced that the shells of all
the Vermes of Linnaeus are extra-vascular from their commence
ment, and remain so during the whole of their connexion with
the living creature.         The first production and the growth of
those shells always depend upon a deposit of material thrown
out from the surface of the body of the living animal.                      The
figure and colour of the several parts of those shells in every
species depend upon the shape and the colouring glands of the
modelling organs.         Fractures are repaired by spreading a cre
taceous fluid over the inner edges, and never by any exudation
from the fractured parts, since they retain always the squared
broken surfaces after such repairs.                  Extraneous     bodies are
equally   covered    with   shell,  whether     they  are  in contact  with the
parent   shell  or  not.     1'he  first  may   be  seen  in  the frequent en
velopment of Nereides in the common oyster ; the latter has been
often ascertained by experiments made for the piirpose of crea
ting artificial pearls, and which might, if skilfully practised, yet
prove very successful.         The borings of parasitical vermes into
shells are never filled up, or the bored surfaces altered, unless
such borings penetrate into the cavity where the living animal
dwells, and then the apertures are universally plugged up or
smeared over with pearly matter.                   The water-worn external
surfaces of old shells and other external abrasions are never re
paired, which is to be seen in old living oysters exposed to the
moving friction of currents or strong tides, in the worn-off spines
of the P/iolas Dactylus and in the convex points of the two
valves of old Mytili ; especially the Mytilus anatinus.                   I have
 sought   in   the   most   extensive     collections   of  the metropolis for
examples     of  fractures,   and  other    injuries  which   have  occurred to
the shells of living vermes, and I have collected manv remark
 able specimens : they all demonstrate the same results without any
 exception.       I have made numerous experiments upon the gar
 den snail Helix nemoralis, by fracturing and breaking away the
 shell in various parts, and have always found the repairs to be
 effected from within and by smearing over an epidermoid varnish,
 and then by plastering the inner surface of that film with suc
 cessive calcareous laminae.           I have in vain attempted to inject
 the shells of recent vermes from the vascular parts of their bodies,
                                                                                 '
 and am fully satisfied that none of their albuminous or gelatinous
 testaceous membranes were ever at any time traversed by vessels :
 indeed they do not possess any of the reticular texture or ar-

   borescent   pores which are common to all vascular parts, but
   microscopically examined they resemble the exuvial or epider
   moid membranes.       To these may be added, the notorious cir
   cumstance of the unchangeableness of the outer surfaces of tes
   taceous shells during their growth, and the continued renewal of
   their other surfaces which admit of contact with the living in
   habitant; next, the stains and coloured transudations which
   they often derive from metallic salts, and other colouring ma
   terials placed in their vicinity; and lastly, that such occurrences
   do not affect the living animal.     The mechanical connexion or
   contact that subsists between the living animals which occupy
   the testaceous shells and their extraneous dwellings is in many
  instances very slender.     The common oyster possesses its first
  pair of valves, consisting of single laminae, before it quits the pa
  rental organs ; a muscle passes between the centres of the con
  cavity of each shell adhering to each, and it acts upon the valves
  nearly at right angles.    The animal has no other continuity with
  the shell : at the hinge an elastic substance is wedged in, the
  spring of which is excited by compression ; but it does not possess
  the property of extension beyond the passive state : when dried
  this substance cracks into cubes.       As the animal grows it aug
  ments the margin of its shells, and thickens them by adding new
  laminae on their insides; the muscular adhesion glides forward,
  still keeping the centre of the valves. The elastic substance at
  the hinge is augmented along the inner surfaces only, and must
  have been always deposited during the expanded state of the
  valves, since the limits of its elastic condition is exactly adapted
  to that state.    As the laminae of the shells increase, there is a
  gap at the outside of the hinge, filled with soft crumbling and
 decomposing worn-out elastic ligament.          This gap presents two
 inclined planes which meet in an acute angle ; and that space is
 kept free from pebbles and hard extraneous bodies by the pre
 sence of the decomposing ligament, as such an accident would
 prove fatal, by preventing the opening of the valves.      The growth
 of all testaceous shells affords remarkable proofs of their extra-
 vascular formation.      The muscular adhesions are generally the
 only points of continuity between the animal and its shell, and
 these are constantly changing with the augmentations of bulk.
 In all the conoid univalves which revolve upon spiral axes, the
 successive parts of the shell are merely spread upon the older
parts without any intermixture of their substances, and the epi -
 dermoid or extraneous bodies are alike involved in the successive
 folds.    In the other classes of animals similar phaenomena oc
cur.      The calcareous shells of birds' eggs are merely deposited
upon the membrana putaminis, and the inner portions are regu
larly crystallized prisms, the long diameters of which point to
                                                                    the

the centre of the egg.     These shells are wholly extra-vascular,
                              .
and their albuminous membranes are alike cuticular, whilst the
inner true memlrana putaminis         made reticular and capable of
                                                 is
vascular organization.      The order of deposit in these examples
is like that of enamel in teeth, which appears to be precipitated
upon the bone of the tooth under the guidance of                  mem           a
branous case or mould.        From a disordered fowl,       have seen  I
eggs produced the calcareous crusts of which were inflated with
bubbles, so as to form     cancellated shell in texture like pumice-
                                  a
stone.    The most durable substances of animal bodies, such as
the bones and teeth, are only partly vascular, since their calcareous
materials are fixed          by
                          chemical precipitants, and remain under
chemical laws.     Injuries done to the horns of cattle, to the hoofs
of animals, and to human nails, are never restored         those parts ;
do.not possess the power of self-repair, and             only by me
                                                                 it   is
chanical wearing away that such injuries are obliterated.            In
deed, the beneficent construction of animal nature                     is
                                                            sufficiently
manifested in the insensibility of all the exuvial coverings, and
in  the inorganic composition of many parts which are exposed
to mechanical attrition as the enamel of teeth, the horny beaks
                                  ;
of birds, and the cuticular or horny coverings of feet.      The same
beneficence appears to be extended to many parts of the ex
ternal organic substances                   by
                                  which painful sensations are ob
viated while the substances themselves, being left directly under
           ;
the dominion of the vital superintendancy, become more perma
nent — such parts are the tendous ligaments, cartilages, cellular
      :
tissue, the gelatine and lime of bones.     Even water       an essen      is
tial constituent of the animal fluids, and affords the necessary
softness and flexibility to the solids. — But this subject and its
connexion with the vegetable composition and texture extends
far beyond the limits of      memoir, and must therefore suspend
                                      a                 I
my observations.

                     T. Jones,    62, Charing Cross, London.
Among      the various instruments used for surveying, the com
pass appears to have been least considered       and this has pro

bably arisen from its want of portability when furnished with a
stand, and the conviction that under the most favourable circum
stances        itfar inferior to the theodolite
                    is                            and yet requires

equal  care  in its adjustment  and use.
   But in military sketching, in the delineation of roads, rivers,
&c. and in all surveys where rapidity     more an object than ex*

iliary, as it possesses the advantage peculiar to itself, of deter
mining the point of station by the bearings of two objects only,
the positions of which are known; and may even in certain con
fined circimistances be- emploved in determining the station of
the observer by the bearing and estimated distance of one known
object.
     These considerations led to the construction of the instalment
which I am about to describe.             It was invented in 1811 by
 Captain Kater, F.R.S.: and on a survey made with it the same
year, was found capable of a degree of accuracy beyond any ex
pectation that had been previously formed of it.
     The box containing the compass is about 2 \ inches diame
 ter, but may be made of any size that may be thought con
 venient.    Its depth is such as to allow no more space than is
sufficient for the card to float freely.         The card is very accu
 rately divided into 360 degrees    from    the north  towards the east,
 and every tenth degree is distinctly numbered.             The needle,
 which is rendered strongly magnetical, is fixed beneath the card
 with its north point at the 180th degree.         It has an agate cap,
 and is made as light as is consistent with that form best calcu
 lated for retaining the magnetic virtue.
     Fig. 1. Plate I. represents the instrument; A is the sight
 next the eye.     It slides rather stiffly in a dovetail on the outside
 of the box, and is prevented by a shoulder from going beyond
 the bottom. Very near the top of this sight on the inside, and
 projecting over the edge of the compass-card, is fixed a small
 plane silvered glass or mirror B, at an angle of about 40°. The
 mirror is of the same breadth as the sight; and when the sight is
 pressed home to the shoulder, the lower edge of the mirror nearly
 touches the glass of the compass.            Between the glass of the
 compass    and   the  upper part   of   the mirror there is sufficient
 room for an opening which contains the segment of a convex
 .lens of about three-fourths of an inch focus.        In a line perpen
 dicular to the centre of the lens, and immediately above the up
 per edge of the mirror a small hole is drilled, through which is
 seen the object the bearing of which is to be determined.            On
  the opposite part of the box is an open sight with a vertical hair
  or wire : this sight is of such a length as to admit of its being
  folded down on the glass of the compass, and a contrivance is
  added, by which the needle is thrown off the point at the same
  time, thus securing it from injury when the instrument is not
  in use.
      To use the Instrument. —Raise the sight, when the compass-
  card will vibrate freely ; look through the small hole above the
  lens, and cover the object with the thread of the opposite sight ;
  check the vibration of the compass-card by inclimng the box,
                                                                 keeping

                       On the Organs   of the Brain.                9
keeping at the same time the object steadily covered' by the hair ;
and when the card is stationary, the degree indicating the bear
ing (which is seen by reflection, and considerably magnified
through the lens), may be read off to fifteen minutes by meaus
of the hair of the sight coming in contact with the reflected
image of the divisions of the card.
   Should not the divisions on the card appear distinct, the sight
next the eye is to be drawn out till they are perfectly well de
fined.     It is adviseable to tap the box gently with the finger, to
lessen any friction which might prevent the needle from settling
in the true direction.
   In addition to all the usual purposes of surveying to which this
instrument is applicable, it may be employed with very superior
advantage as an azimuth compass, or to take bearings from a
boat at sea where the motion might wholly prevent the use of a
compass of any other form ; and on such occasions it will be
found far more accurate than the largest azimuth compass of
the common construction,         and its use unattended with those
difficulties which frequently give rise to erroneous results.
   It would be unnecessary to point out all the various uses to
which this instrument may be applied ; but I may briefly ob
serve, that as an azimuth compass it stands unrivalled, and that
in land-surveying, and in the construction of maps of a country,
it will be found equal in accuracy to a large circumferentor,
though sufficiently portable to be carried in the waistcoat-
pocket.
III. Of certain      Causes which render more difficult the Discern
   ment of the Character of the Mind from the Examination
    of the Organs of the Brain, By Thomas Forster, Esq.
                             To Mr. Tillock.
 Sir, — In      pursuing the anatomy and physiology of the brain
 and nervous system from the time of its first promulgation        in
 England, I have been daily more and more convinced of the
 truth of the doctrine maintained by Gall and Spurzheim. With
the evidence now before me of their correctness, it would             i
 be quite impossible that any arguments drawn from theory
should set aside a systematic arrangement of facts and a theory
 deduced therefrom, in the support of which I could now advert
 mv mind to such a numerous body of evidence.        I have, however,
 in the course of my observations, noticed several causes why the
 apparent indication of the organs were found in a degree falla
 cious ; and why we did not always find the mind possessed of
 energies commensurate to the expectation we had formed fr«m
                                                                   an

                        On the Organs      of the Brain.
  an examination of the size of the organs.            I shall endeavour to
  point   out a few   of these,  in   order   to facilitate the inquiries of
  those who are engaged in similar pursuits, by adverting to the
  causes of some apparent exceptions to the rules.
      It has been already sufficiently explained in all the new books
  on the brain, that the character results not from the size of the
  organs alone, but from their proportion to each other, from
  established mutual influences, from the temperament of the in
  dividual, and from something peculiar in the internal activity of
  the organs.      The two latter circumstances seem immediately
  connected with each other.         1 am at present disposed to attri
  bute more to the particular activity of the organs than I was
  when first I learnt from Spurzheim's           labours the very curious
  facts which support his doctrines.           I have since seen cases in
  which very large organs, even in those whose education was good,
  and were very inactive from this habitual and constitutional ill-
  health of the subject.        Besides the difference in the visible
  structure of the fibres which compose the organs of the brain in
  different persons, it seems that the constitutional differences of
  individuals, whether they are of such a permanent and innate
  nature as are called temperaments, or whether they assume the
  form of acknowledged diseases, or of constitutional tendencies to
  diseases, — as for instance, in scrofulous or consumptive habit, —
  that this peculiar diathesis or temperament must affect the
  functions of the brain, as well as other parts of the animal sy
  stem.     To differences in the actual condition of the nervous
  system, either original or acquired, we must attribute the consti
  tutional tendencies to particular forms of disease, which external
  influences may modify in the production of various disorders.
   To me it appears that the state of the blood and fluids in ge
  neral can only be secondary in the catenation of causes which
  produce changes in the system.          If upon good or bad chylifica-
  tion depend the qualities of the blood ; Upon nervous influence
  must depend chylification.        If blood by determination to parti
  cular parts produce disease, to nervous influence must we ascribe
  such action of the sanguiferous vessels.           From whatever com
  bination of external causes constitutional bad health and pe
  culiarity of temperament depend, the nervous powers are the
  agents, in them consists essentially the disease.            The nervous
  parts of the brain would suffer among the rest, and thus the ac--
» tivity of the organ would be diminished when its size remained
   the same.    This circumstance, combined with the particular ac
  tivity into which   organs may be called by education, constitutes
  one of the chief causes why mental activity does not more regu
  larly and uniformly correspond to the physical development of
  the organs of the faculties.       I have endeavoured to ascertain by
                                                                  extensive

extensive observation of individuals, whether particular organi
zation of the brain wert exempt from any of the calamities of
constitutional    diatheses; but have found no relation between
the two circumstances.          I have seen heads of various kinds in
persons of all the various temperaments and constitutional dis
eases, and the faculties of their minds seemed modified by these
circumstances of constitution.             Sometimes, indeed, there are
exceptions to this rule, wherein we find extraordinary power
of mind in persons in other respects unhealthy,                        and whose
bodies have been enfeebled and almost destroyed by                    disease.    It
will be adviseable in future to examine minutely the                 fibres  which
compose the nervous parts of the brain in persons of different
kinds of constitution,        to ascertain how far the demonstrable
constitution of nervous parts can be shown to agree with cir
cumstances of constitutional           character.        Whatever discoveries
I should be fortunate enough to make in these investigations, I
shall communicate         in the Philosophical Magazine ; and shall
proceed    in  some   future   Number to point out some other diffi
culties we experience      in judging of the activity of particular parts

talent    would  be spared, and many trifling but vexatious disputes
be prevented, if men would endeavour to estimate the value of
their individual labours with more diffidence ; and attend a little
to the advice of Dr. Franklin, who has so properly pointed out,
 both by precept and example, the necessity of doubting one's own
infallibility.    The following remarks of a reverend contemporary
 of ours on this subject, may perhaps be quoted with advantage :
     "  I marvel much how mortals can spend their time in cavil
 ling at each other — in murdering with their pens as well a3 their
 swords, all that is excellent and admirable in human nature —
 instead of curbing their passions, elevating their hopes, and
 tranquillizing their fears. Every evening, for at least one-third
 of the year, heaven has fixed in the sky yonder visible monitor
 to man.       Calmness and splendour are her attendants: no dark
 passions,   no  carking cares, neither spleen nor jealousy seem to
 dwell in that bright orb, where, as has been fondly imagined,

V. Second Reply to Mr. De Luc's Observations on a Paper
  entitled " Re/lections on the Inadequacy of the principal
  Hypotheses to explain the Phcenomena of Electricity." By
     M. Dononan, Esq.
                                    To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —    In    my former reply to Mr. De Luc, I declared that I
had no intention of supporting any electrical hypothesis; on the
contrary, I wished to show that we are deceived when we sup
pose ourselves possessed of any knowledge on the subject beyond
facts.     I did not intend to affirm that Mr. De Luc's experiment,
in which unelectrified pith-balls brought into a positive atmo
sphere appeared negatively electrified, could be justly explained
by the hypothesis of Franklin ; inasmuch as I conceived this hy
pothesis to be itself unfounded ; but merely that it had as good
claims as any other.       My intention was to show that even Volta's
doctrine is untenable, and that Mr. De Luc's experiment brought
forward in support of           it,  better explicable on the views of
                                         is
Frauklin, even though the Frauklinian system              in general er
                                                                is
roneous, than on the views of Volta: and therefore, that the ex
periment in question did not establish the opinions of the latter
philosopher.       My reasons for supposing this have stated to be
                                                           I
as follows.      When the unelectrified balls were brought into a
room where     a    powerful electric machine was dispersing- positive
electricity, they diverged negatively; and this         conceived might
                                                           I
as well be explained           by
                               the agency of electric influences, as an
experiment of mine in which similarly electrified bodies attracted
each other, and which Mr. De Luc accounts for                        by
                                                            the same in
fluences.      I therefore considered that        had an
                                                       I  equal claim to
suppose the positive atmosphere to have repelled the natural
electricity of the balls into their interior substance, and virtually
 to have left the exterior minus.          With this considered the se
                                                           I
 quel  to   correspond.     When    the balls were removed into the un
 electrified room, ihey       lost their  divergence, because the cause
 which induced the minus state in the balls being removed, the
 quantity natural to the balls might receive its former distribu
 tion, and therefore appear in the natural state. But in using
 the expression natural state,         have not made myself understood
                                             I
 to Mr. De Luc.       I   did not mean the natural state as laid down
 by  Franklin.        conceived, even admitting the standard natural
                      I
 state assumed     by   Volta, that the balls should resume their non-
 electrified appearance.        For admit this standard to be variable,
is   itprobable    that  there   was any variation in so short a period
 as that occupied         bythe experiment, when        appears that the
                                                           it
 balls had not time to absorb any electricity from the positive at
                                                                          mosphere   ;

mosphere; and not to speak of probability, what proof can be
adduced that there was a variation ?
    As to the theory of electric influences, I am at a loss to under
stand upon what basis it is founded.       It appears to me to be an
adaptation of an hypothetical principle supported by facts which
admit of a different explanation equally.       In short, throughout
all the hypotheses of electricity which have come within my
 limited knowledge, the proofs are derived from the thing to be
proved, and have this property, that when the reasonings are
pursued in all their evolutions, the inquirer invariably arrives at
the place from whence he set out.
    The other principal topic on which Mr. De Luc is not satisfied,
is my assertion of the permeability of glass ; and he states that
his- explanation of the Leyden phial is founded on a supposition
 of the contrary.    Mr. De Luc also declares himself disinclined
at this advanced and infirm period of his life to undertake any
new experiments, but suggests one to me for trial.          The least
possible return that can be made to a philosopher who has em
 ployed a long life in labours so creditable to himself and service
 able to the cultivators of science, would be to execute his sug
gestions, but that the circumstances have rendered it unnecessary.
 Mr. De Luc will find by referring to my first paper on this sub
ject, that I was aware of the objection, and had prqvided against
it ; he will then probably agree with me that glass is permeable
to the electric fluid.

 VI. Destruction of     the Fiewers and Overmen at       Sheriff Hill
                Colliery.    By A Correspondent.
                            To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — Actuated          by the same motive that prompted me to
write you an account of the shocking accidents which befel the
workmen in Heaton and Newbottle colliery a short time since,
I now transmit the particulars of an explosion at Sheriff Hill ;
not so destructive of human beings as either of those catastro
phes, though highly distressing in its consequences ; for on the
present occasion all the managing and experienced miners em
ployed in the concern have lost their lives.      The mine at Sheriff
Hill is situated on the elevated ground forming the southern
banks of the vale of Tyne opposite Newcastle, from whence its
distance is between two and three miles.         Here the low main
                                                                 coal

                On the comparative Stiffness        of Beams.             15
  coal lies  more than a hundred fathoms from the surface, and in
 it the excavations have been carried on for          a considerable num
 ber of years, the pitmen being now employed in heaving away
 the pillars left at the first working to support the roof.          On the
  morning    of the  27th   of June,   the  overman   who   first descended
 the Isabella pit, finding the air in the mine to be impure, with
 proper attention to the safety of the workmen about to follow
 him, prevented them from going to work as usual, till the cause of
 the obstruction had been ascertained and the ventilation restored
 to its proper course.       For this purpose the three Mr. Foggets
 (resident viewers) with five overmen and three boys, ventured into
 the mine, and soon discovered the stagnation of the atmosphere
 to be occasioned by a body of water escaping from the five-quar
 ter seam, situated eight fathoms above the low main coal, forcing
away a large portion of roof, and bringing with it a quantity
 of carburetted hydrogen gas.          While taking measures to over
come this accident, which had been long dreaded, the inflammable
air by degrees displaced the atmospheric air, and a blast was the
consequence,       which in an instant destroyed all those who were
near it.
    Mr. G. Fogget, having been for some time in a bad state of
health, had quitted the party before the fatal explosion; but ven
turing b;rck in hopes of saving his brothers and a son-in-law,
fell a victim to the azotic gas or after-damp              with which the
mine was now filled.           Nearly   eleven    hours  afterwards   a boy
who accompanied         him was found lying among the water and
mud in a state of insensibility, but, on the usual modes to restore
respiration being administered, slowly returned to life.
    Should the coal-owners of this district continue to pursue the
practice of obtaining the greatest quantity of coals with the
least possible expense, I fear you will have to record many more
of these    horrid catastrophes.

              VII.  On the comparative        Stiffness of Beams.
                          By A Correspondent.
                               To Mr.    Tilloch.
Sir,— »     The     most useful part of the theory of the resistance of
solids, is   that  which   treats of the comparative stiffness of beams ;
yet in some of our best treatises on mechanics it is entirely
omitted; and in others the calculations from theory are so
much at variance with the results obtained by experiment, as to
render them useless in practice.
                                                                     A piece

16               On the comparative             Stiffness      of Beams.
   A piece of Memel timber, eight inches in depth, two inches in
breadth, and supported at each end, the supports being 18 feet
apart, when a weight of 4S0 lbs. was applied to the middle, was
depressed 0'73 inches.    The same weignt was suspended from
the middle of a piece two inches square, the supports were four
feet asunder, and it bent nearly 2'2 inches : but calculating from
Cor. I. Prop. 79, Emerson's Mechanics, (3dedit.4to,) the shorter
piece ought to have bent only half an inch. This difference will,
perhaps, be a sufficient excuse for an attempt to investigate the
                                  ''»
theory.
   All bodies may be extended or compressed, and the extension
or compression, in the same body,         as the force producing it.
                                                 is

the middle   :   by
                 the ac

lower side will be ex

side compressed; but                           .
the extension and corn-
pression, both follow the same law of variation therefore we may     ;
consider the beam subject to extension only.            :•
    Conceive the beam to be composed of          number of equal and
                                                               a
extensible parts, the extension of the parts being as the force
producing    it,   as the weight: but
                   is                           knownit    experiment
                                                          is                  by
that the deflexion      as the weight
                             is          therefore the deflexion
                                                 ;                   as               is
the extension.
   Now the effect of a force to produce extension          inversely as       is
the breadth, and square of the depth           and the extension pro
                                                        ;
duced will vary in the inverse ratio of the distance from the cen
tre of motion, or inversely as the depth therefore, the deflexion
                                                          ;
is inversely as the cube of the depth.       Also, the extension     as               is
the strain, that     directly as the weight and length
                        is                                   and as the       ;
number of parts strained, that         as the length
                                            is          hence, the de    ;

VIII.   Report  on  M. D'Ahcet's Method of extracting Gelatine
  from Bones,      and on its Application to various (economical
   Purposes.     By Messrs. Lkroux, Dubois, Pelletan, Du-
   meril, and Vauquelin*.
M    . D'Arcet     has presented to the Philanthropic Society some
gelatine extracted from bones, by a process which is peculiarly
hii own, inviting them to employ this substance in the broths
and soups which they distribute to convalescents and to the
poor
   The Society accordingly nominated            a commission,   to inquire
into the advantages that may be derived from gelatine prepared
in M. D'Arcet's manner.           After several conferences, in which
they   were assisted  by persons distinguished in chemistry and do
mestic ceconomy, they were at length satisfied that the use of
this substance would afford a considerable saving, and of the
possibility of roasting for the nourishment of convalescents the
greatest part of the meat that is otherwise employed in making
the broth.
   But as the Society never adopt any new article of food
                       * From the Annales    it  Chimie,
Vol.46. No. 20f.      July 1815,                 B                 without

lft        Method    of extracting Gelatine from     Bones,
without previously taking the opinion of the medical faculty, it
has submitted to that body the following questions : First,
whether the gelatine extracted by M. D'Arcet be nutritive, and
to what degree ? Secondly, whether it would be salubrious as an
aliment, and not liable to any inconvenience ?
    To these two points the committee have directed their atten
tion ; and although the method of preparing the gelatine is not
of equal importance with its use as an aliment, we thought it our
duty to become acquainted with it ; and with this view we visited
the manufactory of M. Robert, where it is extracted, and where
we witnessed the series of operations to which the bones are sub
mitted, in order to obtain from them the gelatinous matter in a
state perfectly pure.
    Hitherto the gelatine has been extracted from bones, by sub
mitting them for a long time to the action of boiling water.           By
 this method, which requires the pulverization of at least the
larger bones, scarcely one-third of the gelatine contained in them
 is obtained: they are besides partly deteriorated by the long con
tinued action of the water and heat. These difficulties have
hitherto prevented the adoption in hospitals, of 'broths made
from bones.
    M. D'Arcet has followed a method entirely opposite. He de
 prives them, by means of diluted muriatic acid, of the phosphate
 of lime, and obtains the animal part in a solid state, still preserv
 ing the form of the bones. To take from this substance the
 small portions of acid and fat it retains, he puts it into baskets,
 and plunges it for a few instants into boiling water : lastly, af
 ter wiping it dry with linen cloths, he exposes it to a quick cur
 rent of cold water, which by cleaning it perfectly, renders it white
and demi-transparent.
    Without entering into further details on this subject, it is
enough to observe that M. Robert's establishment leaves nothing
 to be desired with respect to cleanliness and salubrity in the pre
paration of this substance.
    When thus prepared and cut into pieces, the gelatine dissolves
very quickly and almost entirely in boiling water.        If it is wished
 to preserve it to use at a distant time, it is sufficient to expose it
 upon hurdles or nets, either entire or cut up, in a warm and drv
place ; then inclosed in casks or cases it undergoes no alteration,
and may be preserved for a thousand years with all its qualities.
    Let us now examine, with a view to ceconomy, the advantages
of employing M. D'Arcet's gelatine in the preparation of broth.
Although this is not the principal object of the author, it is in
itself of sufficient importance to merit attention.
    It is known that about 100 kilogrammes of meat contain
SO kilogrammes of flesh and fat, and 20 kilogrammes of bones ;
    '                                               -   -    .

          and its Application to various (economical Purposes.       19
    100 kilogrammes   of meat make in our establishments 400 mea
sures    of broth of a demi-litrc each. The bones which are thrown
away     or burnt would give 30 hundredths of dry gelatine ; con
sequently, the 20 kilogrammes above-mentioned              would furnish
six kilogrammes,      from which 600 measures of broth may be
produced.
    The quantity of broth produced from the bones is therefore in
proportion to that from the meat as 3 to '2.
    But pure gelatine having no taste of its own, is not sufficiently
stimulating     to the stomachs of invalids and convalescents :
 M. D'Arcet, therefore, proposes to season the broth with roots
 and herbs, to supply the place of the extractive matter, the
osmazone and the salts of the meat ; or, as appears preferable,
to substitute the gelatine for three-fourths of the meat.
    Thus with 50 kilogrammes of meat as much broth may be
made of a good quality, as is usually made with 200 kilo
grammes; so that the same expense will afford the same quan
tity of broth, and three-fourths of the meat, which may be
roasted for the convalescents, who naturally prefer it to the
 Imiilli of the hospitals, which is nearly reduced to the animal
fibres deprived of all the nourishing juice.
    Thus the food distributed will be considerably improved by
 adopting M. D'Arcet's method, without any additional expense.
 — We will show this advantage by a few examples.
    First, 100 pounds of meat afford but 50 pounds of bouilli,
and 100 pounds of the same meat furnish 67 pounds roasted ;
there     is,
            therefore, nearly    fifth part gained
                                   a              by    roasting it.
    Second, 100 pounds of meat furnish 50 pounds of bouilli,
 and 200 measures of broth.
     Third, 100 pounds of meat, of which 25       is    made into broth,
with three of gelatine, will give 200 measures of broth and 12
pounds and         half of bouilli, and the remaining 75 pounds will
                    a
furnish 50 pounds of roast meat.
     We see that        by
                       this means we have an equal quantity of broth
 of superior quality, and 50 pounds of roast meat, besides 12
 pounds and a half of bouilli         indeed we spend seven francs 50
                                       :
 centimes in the gelatine       but this expense
                                 ;               is    more than covered
    bythe    1pounds and half of louilli.
                2            a                    We must therefore con
  clude from these facts, that this process affords not only the
 means of greatly improving the 'subsistence of the indigent, but
 also    adegree of ceconomy which         isnot to be neglected.
     This being demonstrated,      we   will now proceed to the principal
;bbject of our mission, which more particularly concerns the me-
. dical profession, and the only one on which the Society has con
  sulted them      which
                    5         the nutritive properties and salubrity of
                             is,
    gelatine.                          B   2                       With

20           Method  of extracting Gelatine from     Bones.
    With respect to the first part of this question, every one who
is acquainted with the nature of meat, is convinced that the' nu
tritive property it communicates to the broth, is derived princi
pally, if not entirely, from the gelatine.     If daily experience did
not furnish undeniable proofs of this, we should find it attested
by numberless authors who have written on this subject, and
who all consider gelatine as the most nourishing of animal mat
 ters.     Some persons may object that gelatine cannot supply the
place of meat in the preparation of broth, because it is deprived
of salts, and of the extract particularly denominated osmazone,
which gives the colour, taste, and pleasant flavour to broth.
     But we reply, that this principle does not exist in veal, poultry,
 or pork, and yet these meats are very nourishing ; and, more
 over, M. D'Arcet proposes, as we have before mentioned, to
 supply the portions of those substances that are deficient in the
 broth of gelatine, by a greater quantity of roots, such as onions,
 turnips, celery, carrots, &c. which are savoury, aromatic, and .
saline.
     But the most conclusive experiment, and one to which everv
 one must assent, was that which was made under our own in
 spection at the medical hospital.      The broth was prepared with
 one quarter of the meat commonly used, gelatine and roots sup
 plied the place of the other three quarters, which were roasted,
 and given to the invalids and convalescents, and even to the per
 sons in attendance, who perceived no difference between this .
 broth and that to which they had been used : they were also
 abundantly nourished, and perfectly satisfied to have roast meat
 instead of louilli.
     Here then is one part of the question resolved.        The broth
 made according to M. D'Arcet's process, is at least as agreeable
 as the broth commonly made in hospitals ; as to the other part,
 namely, the salubrity of the broth, we can affirm that of 40 per
 sons who partook of it for three months, not one of them expe
 rienced any symptoms that could be reasonably attributed to the
 gelatine ; the progress of the sick was the same as usual, and
  the convalescents were not longer recovering than in other cir
  cumstances.     We may, therefore, without hesitation conclude,
  that gelatine is not only nourishing and easy of digestion, but
  also that it is very salubrious; and employed in the way pro
 posed by M. D'Arcet, cannot have any bad effect on the animal
  frame.
     Nor are these the only advantages to be derived from the
  gelatine- extracted in the above manner : there are many others,
  on which I shall add a few words in this place.

by wine-merchants   in their white wines, also in clarifying coffee,
making jellies and creams  ; and lastly, it may be used instead of
isinglass on all occasions.
    2d. The gelatine simply dried and cut in pieces, contains a
great quantity of nourishment in a very small compass ; it may
be rendered useful to make soup for sailors during long voyages,
for soldiers in besieged towns, andeven in camps and barracks.
    3d. If made into cakes with a certain quantity of gravy and
roots, it will make an excellent dish both for the naval and mi
litary officers.    M. D'Arcet lias shown us some specimens of this
preparation, which surpass in beauty and quality all that we have
hitherto seen of this kind.
   4th and lastly. It can be employed to make glue with more
advantage than any other substance that has been used for the
purpose ; the operation will be much shortened by             and the    it,
glue infinitely better.    The tenacity of the latter, according to
some experiments made            by

opticians,    isto the best Paris glue as    to 4    3,

valuable to joiners, cabinet-makers, &c. and especially to paper-
makers, who frequently fail in their operations for want of good
glue.
    It   but justice to add, that M. D'Arcet,

    The ancients also distinguished two kinds of ceruse. That
which Pliny called cerussa cremaia or usta, seems to me to be
only burnt ochre slaked in vinegar.        It was used for painting
shadows.       The other kind of ceruse, which the Greeks called
psynmythium, and the Latins cerussa, was obtained by the ac
tion of vinegar on lead. The ladies used it for the skin ; the
painters used it also : but Pliny places it in the third rank only
 among the white colours.                                       ,
    The black colour or atramentum of the ancient painters was
.successively the ivory-black of Apelles, the soot-black produced
by the    combustion of the resins, the charcoal of wood, and China
      '
ink.      In order to make writing-ink, gum was added, and a fat
substance (ghctinum) in order to paint on the walls.
    The purpurissum held the first rank among the fine colours.
 It was a lake which was prepared by absorbing the decoction of
madder by means of the earth which Pliny calls creta argentarit.
 I presume that this earth, which was brought fr6m England, far
 from being chalk, was a very white clay, because the chalk would
give a vinous lake, and the argil, on the contrary, one of a very
 fine red.    The best purpurissum is obtained from the first de
 coction : by increasing the quantity of water, the qualities were
 of course varied.
    The ancients formed purpurissum also by collecting the froth
 which is formed on the solutions or decoctions of purple.
    The armenium was a blue stone, which was long brought from
 Armenia ; but a sand was found in Spain, which rendered this
 colour more plentiful and cheaper.
    The green earths were also employed as a colouring principle.
    Pliny observed that all the chefs d'eeuvre of the ancient
painters were composed with four colours; 1st. The white re
 duced to melinum alone; 2d. Ochre; 3d. The red earth or
 Pontic sinopis ; 4th. The black atramentum. — It was, as he says,
with those four colours that Apelles, Melanthus,Nicomachus, com
posed their chefs d'eeuvre:
                                " and, now-a-days," he adds," that
 the purple covers our walls, and that India sends us the coloured
slime of her rivers, we have more paint and less of true art."
    Hence we find that the ancients employed almost none but-
 natural colours in painting, and these were unalterable in air
 and water, and as we shall ppesently show, capable of being
 preserved without alteration and without degradation.            But
 how does it happen that these very colours, most of which are
 used in modern paintings, change their hue on our canvass ?
 Wherefore are our paintings incapable of preserving their colour
 even for a few years, while the pictures of the ancients have not
 lost their lustre after many centuries ?     This question, which is
 very   important  to the arts, deserves great attention; and I think
                                                                  that

that its solution can be found only in the different ways of
painting practised by the ancients and moderns.
   Pliny informs us that there still existed in his day, in a tem
ple of Ardea, a town of Latium, paintings more ancient than
the city of Rome ; and he expresses his astonishment           that
the colours had preserved all their freshness.,      although they
were exposed     to the air.     Some verses underneath these
paintings announced that they were the work of one Ludius, a'
                                                                    '
painter of Etolia.   He also mentions some works of the same
painter, such as an Atalanta and a Helen, which were to be seen.
at Lanuvium, and which were also in good preservation, al
though in the ruins of a temple.     The same author also speaks
of still more ancient paintings which were to be seen at Cer6,
a   city of Etruria.
    We find, to our admiration, on the wrappings of some Egyptian
mummies, and on the monuments of this ancient country of the
arts, colours which have not lost much of their lustre.      I have
seen fragments of ancient paintings brought from Volsena, the
ancient capital of the Etruscans ; and also from the baths of-
Titus: — these were in admirable preservation, and they are
composed of coloured earths only.
    It remains to inquire, therefore, what was the method used
by the ancients in painting, and to compare it with our present
processes, before we can decide on the causes of the inaltera
bility of the ancient paintings, and on those of the degradation
of modern paintings.
    Vossius informs us that the ancients formed the priming of-
their pictures with a coat of wax, and that this wax was coloured
according to the subject which they wished to treat : he adds,'
that after having applied this coating of wax, they heated it and'-
spread it.      The painters, as Varro informs' us, kept their co
loured wax in boxes with compartments.
    Vitruvius describes a process little different from that which ;
we have described.        He says that the coating was formed with
 melted wax, softened with a little oil, and applied With a pen--
 cil ; it was afterwards made to penetrate the wall by means of
 a stove heated with charcoal, and with cloths a polish was given
 to   it,as ispractised with marhle figures vessels were also coated

   Wajt, therefore, was the vehicle of the colours of the ancients.'
The drying oils supplied its place, four centuries ago ; and it is
to John of Bruges that this discovery has been referred, which
has been since generally adopted.    Mow that we know its merits
and defects,  we  must be  permitted a few reflections on its just
value.
   The drying oils may of course be mixed with great facility
with colours, forming with them a very manageable article ; the
finest and most delicate tints may thus be given: the painting
in oil dries quickly, and the work of the artist is never thereby
suspended ; but on the other hand, the drying oils become yel
low when they come in contact with the air, and spoil the
purest colours; the white becomes yellow; the blues, with the
exception of ultra-marine which is almost indestructible, become
green ; the tints hold out irregularly, the transparent tints are
obliterated by age.     The coats of paint superposed, ac in a dif
ferent way ; speedily there is no more harmony in the tones, in
the shadings, nor among the various parts.         The oil which is
dried, progressively and constantly becomes resinous, cracks,
scales oif, and falls from the canvass in consequence of shrinking.
All these defects are inseparable from the use of drying oils; and
if the works of some schools have partly escaped these altera
tions, it is to the use of a small number of inalterable colours that
we owe their preservation.         Most of the fine pictures of our
museums now exhibit nothing to our admiration but correct
ness of drawing, fine harmony of composition, character and
expression in the figures ; for the painting, properlv speaking,
no longer exists, and the authors of some of these fine works
would not know their own pictures, if they saw them at pre
sent.
   We must therefore adopt some other method of painting, if
we are animated with the noble ambition of working for po
sterity ; and we shall hazard a few observations on the use of
wax, as a method of preparing canvass, and afterwards serving
as a vehicle for colours.
   The ancients prepared the base of their pictures with a coat
ing of coloured or colourless wax, which they made even by ap
plying heat to it : they afterwards painted over it: " Item muris
olducelant cerce loricam, in eaque pingebani," says Vossius.      It
appears   that they sometimes  used oil to soften  the  wax ; which
was attended with the inconvenience of making the latter run
when a warm body was brought close to        it,
                                               with    view to unite
                                                       a
and polish the coat.    Thus Vitruvius, in speaking of this pro
cess, makes use of the words sudare cogat      ;  which proves that
the oil  is detached, and forms an obstacle to the junction of
the wax  ;   an inconvenience which   I  have experienced on re

       Inquiries into Ike encaustic Painting   of the Ancients,      25
pesting the process.      Besides, this mixture of wax and oil re
tains a softness and glueyness too long, which does not admit of
the celerity which is wanted in these kinds of works.        Pliny say»
that the wax may be melted by means of heat, and applied with
a pencil : but as it hardens in the air with great facility, it will
be difficult to form in this way a very compact coating.
    We must therefore invent another method of making war
manageable by the pencil, and which shall procure a prompt
desiccation, without taking from its whiteness or consistence.
We may find this desideratum, <l think, in the employment of
the volatile oils, or the colourless essences.     It is sufficient in
order to melt the wax in a volatile oil to employ it in stripes, as
it is when bleached, and to sprinkle it after that with some drops
of oil.    A slight heat is then sufficient to operate the solution ;
and we thus obtain a very transparent liquid : — the same result
is obtained with a fixed oil.     The fixed oils well purified, or the
colourless volatile oils, ought to be employed in this operation.
This combination may be applied to canvass, wood, or marble, ifi
the liquid state : it then adheres strongly to those bodies, be
cause it penetrates them, and forms on their surface a white and
slightly transparent coating.      But the solution of the wax in
the volatile oil is preferable,    because, in addition to its being
whiter, a heat of 20 or 25 degrees is sufficient to evaporate the
oil, and give more consistence to the coating.          Care must at
the same be taken not to heat too strongly, lest the wax itself
should be evaporated.      We may also prime canvass intended for
paintings in the following way: —
    When the combination of volatile oil and of wax is fixed, it
forms a soft paste which may be easily spread over canvass,
wood, and marble.       By means of a polished hot iron, the wax
is made to penetrate these various substances.        The heat then
evaporates the volatile oil, and a coating of wax only remains.
 By priming canvass in this way we may cover both surfaces, and
 thus place them out of the reach of air and humidity, which
 will render their duration almost eternal.
    If it be only wanted to apply one colour upon a base, and to
 produce what the ancients called a monochrome painting, it is
 sufficient to mix the colour which we wish to use, with the liquid
 combination of oil and wax, and to stir until the mixture is
 hardened. We should then apply the paste to the surface of
 the body upon which we wish to paint, and make it penetrate
 by means of an iron slightly heated.       Some drops of olive oil
 spread over the surface will facilitate the operation of polishing
 which it is important to give to the coat of painting: this slight
 coat of oil will be afterwards removed by means of a piece of
 leather or fine linen.    By thjs process the polish of the marble
                                                                 statues

statues of the ancients, or of our modern stucco, is given to the
painting.
 .  If it is desired to paint in several colours (which truly con
stitutes painting), wax can be coloured, and all the different
tones requisite can be given to it.       But this employ becomes
still more difficult, because these waxes can only be applied with
a pencil : it is therefore necessary to keep them in a soft state
approaching to fluidity, where there is the advantage of artifi
cial heat, or the maintenance of a temperature kept up suffi
ciently in the workshop.        It would be possible, however, by
varying the proportions of the oil, to obtain coloured pastes-
which might be touched and retouched by the pencil, at the or
dinary temperature of the atmosphere; only the drying up would. >'
then be very slow, and I think that the wax, being brought to a.
permanent state of fluidity by means of several drops of alkali
poured on the melted wax, would form a preferable mixture, be
cause the wax     still remains liquid, and as white as milk.           It is
easy   to incorporate    on   the  palette  the colours   with this  milk  of
wax (lait   de  cire);  it gives  them  a  suitable consistency,   and  they
are used with a pencil like those which are prepared with drying
oil. M. Bachelier, who suggested this vehicle for colours nearly
forty years ago, composed in this way pictures which have not
sensibly suffered in point of colouring.
    M. Castellan lately communicated to the Institute a new
method of painting, which strongly resembles that of the an
cients : he begins by priming his base with a coat of melted
wax, taking care previously to heat and dry the stucco and
plaster : he spreads the wax with a brush, equalizes the surface
by passing a gilder's stove over         it,  or the hot disk which the
ancients used pieces of new cloth and coarse brushes passed
               ;
over this surface terminate the work of priming.             All the modi
fications requisite for the priming of wood, plaster, and canvass,
are detailed in M. Castellan's memoir.                He paints on those
primings with colours ground with olive oil and not drying oil.
The painting    is  dried by passing the stove over the picture, or
by  raising  the   temperature of the workshop to 30J or 40° of
heat; or lastly,     by  exposing the picture to the sun.          Painting
on canvass requires for its desiccation        a heat of 20° or SO3 only.
M. Castellan glazes his pictures with a transparent varnish
which  is  made by the solution of wax in      a   colourless volatile oil.
   Several paintings executed       by   this process have been exposed
for several years to all the inclemencies of the air, without being
sensibly altered.      Even the English lake, which fades so quickly
in the sun, has not -lost any of its intenseiiess of colour.
   The process proposed       by    M. Castellan appears to possess the
following advantages.
                                                                     I.   It

          Process for Curing Herrings in the Dutch Manner.                  27
 .    1.   It incorporates,   by means of heat, the painting with the
base      and priming, in such a way that we have only one single.
body ; whereas in painting with drying oil, the coats of priming
and of painting are not melted together, but superposed on
each other.         We may be convinced of this by observing closely
the operations resorted to in giving a fresh canvass to an old
painting : every coat of paint is found to be distinct, and ad
heres more or less closely, according to its thickness and the
principles of which it is composed.            The picture soon undergoes
a great alteration by this process.
     2. In the substance which serves for priming, or preparing the
base, as well as in the vehicles for the colours or the varnishing,
there is nothing capable of shrinking in course of time, or from.
progressive desiccation ; so that the painting can neither warp
nor crack, nor fall off in scales.
      3. The colours being melted in the wax and covered with a
coating of the same substance, are completely out of the reach
of air and humidity, which are the most powerful destroyers of
paintings.
      M. Castellan's process for painting has this advantage over
every other hitherto practised for imitating the encaustic painting
of the ancients ; namely, it does not overturn the customs which
obtain in all modern schools for painting : there is in painting a
merit so intimately connected with the mode of execution, that
a sudden change in this would be repugnant to every painter,
whose ideas are more intimately connected than is generally
supposed with the mode of expressing them.                Several landscapes
 which have been painted by M. Castellan, and two large por-:
traits by M. Taunay, exhibit no difference from common oil
paintings : we perceive in them the same freedom of penciling,
the same boldness of touch, clean execution, lightness of co
 louring, and the same transparency of tone.

to Amsterdam, and large orders for the West Indies, — a decided
proof I presume of the great superiority of my peculiar method

          On a minute examination of the samples of herrings pro
duced    to the committee, it appeared that those caught in the
deep sea of the coast of Shetland were fatter and fuller of milts
and roes than those caught on the coast of Yarmouth.                  Mr.
Sievers stated, that herrings are generally known under three
denominations, viz. the St. Michael's herring, the Highland
herring, and the long shotten herring.          That the deep sea fish
ing is carried on in sloops, each carrying ten or twelve hands,
that they go to Shetland to clear out according to act of parlia
ment about 16th June, and have then to return to commence
the fishery at Buchaness off Peterhead on the 24th of June ; that
by being thus at present obliged to go first to Sheerness to clear
out, they suffer great disadvanges by delays from wind and
weather, in a voyage of 300 miles before they can commence
the fishery at Buchaness ; and that the Dutch have an advantage
from not being obliged to go to Shetland ; that the herrings
caught in the deep sea off Buchaness are large, fat, and full-
bellied ; they are also richer in flavour, and more esteemed for
home consumption and the continent, but do not keep so well
as the lanker herrings caught near Yarmouth, which last are
 better calculated for the West India markets ; that the Yar
 mouth fishery is carried on in September and October, as the
 herrings come down the German ocean.

 Hitherto         chemists have considered the fat of organized bodies
 as being formed of one substance, having the same essential pro
 perties, and differing only by its firmer or weaker consistence:
 hence the various denominations of suet, lard, fat, marrow, &c.
 admitted by the ancients.        This consistence of fat varies in fact
  in a manner truly remarkable : thus it is hard in the ruminating
  quadrupeds, softer in man than in the animals which live upon
  vegetables only, alnrest liquid in the amphibious mammifera?,
   the cetacei, as well as in all, the carnivorous animals, whether
   birds, reptiles, fishes, or insects.   Not only does the consistence
   of the fat vary in the various kinds of animals, but also accord-

ing to the regions which they occupy, and according to the age,
sex, and physical constitution of the individual.   It is very hard
in the neighbourhood of the kidneys, softer in the epiploon, the
mesentery, the intestines, and around other moveable viscera :
it is almost liquid when it coats the orbitary cavities. Certain
accidental dispositions also produce remarkable changes in the
.consistence of the fat, as is observed in the steatoma, the old
 hernias of the epiploon, and in certain sebaceous tumours, which
are sometimes as hard as a calculus.
   On reflecting on this infinite variation in the consistence of
fat, and seeing besides that suet and oil seem to be the two ex
tremes of this consistence, it appeared to me that with these two
bodies mixed in various proportions, nature might produce that
diversity of fat bodies which we observe in organized beings.
Deeplv penetrated with this idea, which appeared specious at
least, I endeavoured to find among the chemical reagents some
substances capable of separating the 6uet and the oil which 1
supposed to exist in all the fats, but I found none which could ef
fect my purpose ; when at last a very simple method presented
itself to my mind, and fully confirmed my conjecture.           It is
founded   on the physical property peculiar   to oil, of being taken
up greedily by gray paper, which is not touched by suet or tal
low, in its state of purity. It was by applying this process to
the analysis of fatty substances that I succeeded in discovering
the two substances which compose them, and in determining
their respective proportions in the following substances.
                          Melted Butter.
     This article was forcibly compressed for several days at the
 temperature of zero, between several folds of coarse gray paper,
 taking care to renew it until it was no longer stained : when
 again pressed as at first, at a temperature of 15° Reaumur, a
 white brittle matter was obtained, at least as compact -as the
 butter of cocoa or the hardest suet, of a very decided smell and
'taste of suet. Suspecting that it might still retain some traces
 of oleaginous matter, it was melted, and I mixed with it a small
 quantity of volatile oil of turpentine : the matter, when har
 dened and pressed to absolute dryness in blotting-paper, pre
 sented a substance which was kept in fusion during some time :
 when hardened, it was dry, broke with lustre, and melted at the
 same degree of heat as beef suet, a temperature which I found
 to be 46° of Reaumur, while we find that mutton suet requires
  a temperature of 49°.    The suet of cow butter  is,
                                                     in fact, similar
  to that which exists in the various parts of the body of this ani
 mal :   a result which might lead to some physiological conse

32          Memoir on the Nature of fat Substances.
                   Of the  Fat of Pork, or Lard.
   Like melted butter and the other fats, that of pork has been
hitherto regarded as a homogeneous body.              M. Vogel consi
dering it as such, submitted it to a series of experiments in a
memoir particularly directed to the examination of this sub
stance*. Recent hogs-lard, well purified, was long pressed in
gray paper, as we have directed in the case of butter, and a suet
was obtained of the consistence of soft wax ; as this suet seemed
to me still to retain some oil, it was purified by melting it in oil
of turpentine, and by submitting the mixture when cold to new
compressions in gray paper, there remained a sebaceous matter,
which was held in fusion some time to extract the small quan
tity of oil of turpentine which it might contain.          This absolute
suet at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere is dry, brittle,
«nd inodorous, like the other suets in their state of purity ; but
it differs from them in being almost transparent or semi-dia
phanous like certain calcedonies; it is softened or reduced by the
fingers with great difficulty, although more easily than beef suet,
and has not such a greasy appearance, but it is soft and soapy
to the touch like whale fat, like which it leaves a bnlliant lustre
when it is rubbed on bodies: in these respects it resembles
spermaceti t it has, however, but a grainy crystallization, not
decided; and it is less soluble in boiling alcohol, although the
latter takes up enough to make the liquid turbid on cooling, and
there are separated flakes of greasy matter on the addition of
sitre.
    The suet of pork requires for its fusion a temperature a little
higher than that which is necessary for melting whale fat.
    The same suet, like all those obtained from the different fatty
 substances, undergoes under the action of the acids and alkalis
 a very remarkable alteration, in so much as it is converted into
two substances which did not exist before ; namely, adipocire
 and oil, both extremely soluble in warm alcohol.            This trans
 formation is entirely and immediately affected by pouring into
 one part of pork suet melted, half a part of sulphuric acid, and
by immediately diluting the mixture with a quantity of boiling
 water in order to take up the acid and to separate the two fat
matters newly formed, which we shall presently make known.               I
shall content myself with observing at present, that the suet of
 pork on being converted into adipocire and oil is susceptible of
 forming with the sulphuric acid a soapy combination sufficiently
 intimate, and.even soluble in water like soap, which does not
 precisely happen on treating beef or mutton suet in the same
 way, although all the fat substances, in changing their nature,

 also saturate one part of the properties of the sulphuric acid, as
 they saturate that of the alkalies.   Potash in saponifying pork
suet transforms it also into adipocire and oil *.      The gray pa
 per in which the lard had been compressed was strongly pene
trated with oil ; it was moistened with hot water and subjected
to the action of the press, after having been inclosed in a strong
.cioth, and we obtained an oil which was easily separated from
 the water.   The oil of lard is a colourless fluid like water, of a
peculiar taste.   When exposed to a greater degree of cold it
does not freeze, if it has been obtained at a low temperature.

   If the compression of the lard has been effected   at a middling
temperature, we obtain a greater quantity of      oil  ; but in this
case the fatter retains some suet, and is hardened into a gela
tinous consistence when exposed to the cold.

   When slightly pressed between the fingers, this substance,
taken from the interior of the thigh-bone, seemed entirely formed
of an innumerable multitude of very distinct transparent bags
containing the marrow.     We shall see presently that this struc
ture is not peculiar to the marrow, but that it is common to all
fat substances in the animal kingdom.       When well washed and
freed from its vascular envelopes by    fusion,  beef marrow had a
firm consistence at the temperature of    —  -2° R. ; in this state it
was pressed in gray paper until it ceased to stain    and obtained        it,   I

    But the suet thus obtained was soft, and consequently still
 retained a little oil : in order to purify it completely, it was
 melted, and I added to it an equal quantity of volatile oil of tur
 pentine. — The mixture when cooled and pressed as before, fur
 nished a suet which did not differ much from beef suet : it seemed,
 however, to be a little more fusible.      The oil of beef marrow is
 an almost colourless liquid, and has a disagreeable taste.
                             Mutton Marrow.
    It is nearly of the same structure as that of beef; but it con
 tains a much more considerable quantity of oil.         Thus 100 parts
 of mutton marrow washed and melted gave me at the tempera
 ture of — 2° Reaumur: Suet 26; oil 74.
    The suet of mutton marrow, purified as above, has the same
 appearance with common mutton suet ; like which it is of a dry
 and brittle consistence, which admits of its being reduced to pow
der ; but it is more fusible, for i» melts at 4 1° of Reaumur, whereas
 common mutton suet from the kidneys fuses only at the tem
 perature of 49 ', which seems to establish a difference between
those two substances ; which have besides the property of waxing
substances, like bees-wax.

ture of — 2 R : Oil 68 ; suet 32.
    Goose grease purified witb essence of turpentine has the
whiteness, hardness, dryness, and fracture of common beef suet ;
but it is much more fusible, for it begins to melt at 35° R. The
oil of goose is a liquid slightly coloured, and has the taste and
smell peculiar to the goose.

 — 2a R. produced : Oil 72 ; suet 28.
    The oil of ducks possesses the taste, smell, and yellowish co
lour which is visible in the fat of the animals.         The suet when
very pure is white, not very sapid, inodorous, dry, and breaks
like wax.     It differs from goose suet in so far as it affects a de
cisive crystalline form : besides, it requires 42° R. to melt it.
It is dissolved in boiling alcohol, but in a small quantity.

  by oil of turpentine, is not so dry and    fragile as that of ducks :
 it melts at 36° R.
                                Olive Oil.
     The oil extracted from olives is no longer, as has been sup
posed, an immediate simple principle : it is composed, like all
 the -fat bodies, of two distinct substances.        Olive oil of good
quality was exposed for two days to the temperature of — 5° R.:
it formed into a mass of the consistence of honey : when pressed
at the same degree of cold in gray paper, a suet was obtained
of a brilliant white, inodorous, not very sapid, and as firm as
beef suet, but of far greater fusibility, for it melted at 16° R.
The alkalies by acting on this suet metamorphose it into oil so
luble in alcohol and into an adipocire which melts at 50° R.
Only.      The oil of olives thus isolated from its suet, and pene
trating the paper in which it had been pressed, was separated
from the paper by humecting it with warm water, and pressing
it again.     This oil has the smell and taste of olive oil ; but when
exposed to a temperature of 10D R. it does not freeze; although
exposed to a more considerable cold, a small quantity of suet
still leaves it.   The property which this oil has of not freezing
and not becoming rancid, renders it valuable in the arts, and par
ticularly to watch-makers; but it has nevertheless a great incon
venience when employed in its common state ; namely, as it
freezes at a middling degree of cold, there must be a consequent
irregularity in the movements of the delicate machinery to which
it is applied.    The oil of olives, however, when deprived of its.
suet is absolutely free from this complaint, and has all the qua
lities which we can wish.      100 parts of olive oil at the tempera
 ture of — 5" R., produced :
             Oil of a greenish yellow                      72
             Very white suet                              28

    Without reckoning the frequent falsifications to which olive
oil is subject in its purest state, it is not always identical in the
proportion of its principles : thus the virgin oil, or that which
is obtained bv a slight pressure of the olives, contains much less
Suet than that which comes afterwards : it is therefore impro
 per for the manufacture of soap, and we shall presently see that
 the suet or adipocire is indispensable in the manufacture of soap
 of good quality.

very white suet 24.
   The above suet resembles the rest in its colour and con
sistence ; but it is distinguished from them by its extreme fusibi
lity ; for it melts at 5J of Reaumur, and freezes again on the
temperature being lowered.        This suet, which is so fusible, is
transformed by the action of potash into oil, and into an adipo-
cire which melts at 4~>= onlv ; which is very remarkable.      The
oil of sweet almonds deprived of its suet resists the greatest cold
without losing its fluidity.

is less capable of freezing than oil of sweet almonds, since the
latter requires at least 7° or 8' below zero. At —3° R. the oil of

 those    which probably exist in the volatile oil of roses and in
 that   of the elder-tree which have the consistence of butter.          We'
 may say the same of the volatile oils furnished by the umbelli
 ferous plants; such as the parsley, fennel, dill, cumin, and ani
 seed*, all of which have the property of freezing in a very slight
 degree    of cold.
                          Experiments upon Suet.
     Physiologists   are of opinion generally, that the fat has its seat
 in the   cellular texture.     On examining with the naked eye suet
 as we meet with it in animals, i. e. that which envelops the kid
 neys in the ruminating quadrupeds, we find it arranged in con-'
 choid, square, or orbicular masses^ separated from each other
 by membranous         laminae.    If we examine each of these masses
attentively, we see them entirely formed of an innumerable mul
titude of oblong globules, transparent and brilliant like a crystal
lized salt, and which seem tied to each other by a very loose
membranous texture, like the grains of starch in a boiled pota-
toe.     We may separate these globules from eacfi other by slightly
macerating the suet in cold water, and shaking the whole over a
hair sieve.      We then obtain a powder which resembles starch
when it has been dried on gray paper.               These membranous ve
sicles containing the suet, did not appear to me to have the same
structure as the cellular texture, which is formed, as we know,
by the junction and mutual adherence of tiie cellules which com
municate with each other.
     In order to ascertain if those membranous cysts serving as a
reservoir to the fat had any orifices to allow it to escape, they
were exposed to different degrees of heat with water ; but it was
only at a heat of 65" of Reaumur that some bubbles of greasy
matter melted, began to appear on the surface of the liquor,
and even at the boiling point a great number of those isolated
vesicles still existed without having given out any grease : hence
it follows that every globule of suet is contained exactly in a
membranous vesicular envelope, which hinders it from separating,
even at a heat much greater than that which is necessary for
melting it.      The adipose glands of Malpighi, which no author
since his day has discovered, are they the eame organs with
those vesicles filled with suet?            I am not inclined to think sol
since we observe the latter very distinctly without the assist-
    *.On examining some casks which had contained aniseed oit,       I found
tlie whole inside fringed with a brilliant dry crystallized matter, wlm-h it
was easy to collect, even in.a considerable quantity;    and 1 thought of ex*
amhling these crystals more minutely: but having- left them during a whole
sarauier exposed to the solar light, 1 found them resolved into a thick li-
qaid which lost the faculty   of crystallizing.

ance of the microscope, in the fats which are not too soft.
However this may be, the fatty substance, liquid or solid, fixed
or volatile, and wherever we meet with it in organized beings,
presents nearly the same structure in the reservoir where nature
has placed it. -To give some examples of this taken from the
vegetable kingdom, I shall cite among the plants which secrete
the sebaceo-cirom matter, the corpuscles which constitute the
dust of the leaves and fruits which Proust has found analogous
to wax. On examining this dust with the microscope, we see it
formed of transparent grains, the form ofwhich varies with the
species: an analogous configuration             may be remarked in the
waxy substance which coats the surface of myrtle-berries.                   It
is sufficient to press strongly the latter, in order to free them
of the wax, which has a grainy and amylaceous appearance.
The volatile oils are also contained in small membranous blad
ders, as is proved by the epithets of vesicular, miliary, globu-
lous glands, which botanists have given to these small reservoirs
filled with volatile oil.       I shall not inquire, with physiologists, if
the secretion of the suet or of the fat operates, as they pretend,
by the extremities of the arteries, or by oozing through their
tunics: one thing is certain, that this secretion takes place un
 der certain circumstances with incredible celerity.
     Suet does not exist in a state of absolute purity in animals,
 and hitherto it has been unknown any where in that state: the
 firmest which can be procured still contains a certain quantity
 of oil; that which incloses the kidneys in sheep contains more
 than that of bullocks : the tallow used for candles also furnishes
 a great quantity; for 100 parts at the temperature of 5' R. yielded
 30 parts of oil. We succeed in depriving these fatty substances
 of their oil by melting them and adding spirit of turpentine
 newly distilled ; the mixture, frozen and pressed in a cloth, or
 what is still better in gray paper, leaves the suet in a state of
 purity : it is only necessary to keep it in fusion for some time,
 and allow it to cool.         Pure mutton suet thus obtained is a sub
 stance very analogous to wax, and seems even to be more com-
          drier, and more brittle; but it has not the same ductility,
   or it
 {>act,  is easily reduced to powder ; it likewise waxes bodies, giving
 them a glossy appearance like bees -wax, and emitting the same
 noise on being rubbed*.             Pure mutton suet melts at the tem
  perature of 49° R : yellow wax melts precisely at the same de-
    * Fatty substances    ns well as certain families of organized beings seem
 to contain a great quantity of species which pass to each other by shades
 «o slight that it is difficult to group them well: thus we are frequently
  embarrassed, when it is wanted to range this or that fatty substance,
  whether to do so among the waxes, the suets, or the adipocires, and it must
  be admitted that the last three genera arc purely artificial.
                                                                          gree

gree    of heat, according to Bostock ; but this suet is less soluble
than wax, and than the white fat of whales in boiling alcohol.
The latter may, however, dissolve to make the liquor turbid on
cooling.      Boiling ether dissolves it better, and upon cooling a
precipitate is formed in large gelatinous flakes.
     Pure beef suet is white, although having naturally a yellow
colour when it is not purified, which makes it be supposed that
this colour is owing to oil : it has a greasier aspect than mutton
suet ; it is besides more fusible, since it is liquefied at 46° R.
Thus it is less adapted for candles than pure mutton suet, which
when obtained by some easy process will afford the means of
supplying the place of wax in some circumstances.
      In order to complete what I have said as to suet, I shall enter
upon some details respecting its singular metamorphosis into
several fat substances by the action of the acids and alkalies,
which will lead me to examine the results of saponification and
 rancidity.
               Action  of the Sulphuric Acid    upon Suel.
      Chemists have contented themselves with saying, that the sul
 phuric acid decomposes and carbonizes fat, particularly with the
 aid of heat ; but it does not appear that they have examined
 with care the results of this action.       If we pour concentrated
 sulphuric acid into melted suet, there is immediately formed by
 agitation a true combination, in which the acidity has in a great
                                                                       '
 measure disappeared.        To one part of melted mutton suet was
 added half a pint of sulphuric acid, and the combination, which
 was of a reddish colour, was diluted in a great quantity of boil
 ing water, which seized the sulphuric acid and abandoned the
 greasy matter.      The latter, after having been washed several
 times, had not perfectly lost its weight, but it had acquired a
 less firm consistence than the suet employed : the latter was in
 fact transformed into a small quantity of oil, and into a substance
 very analogous to wax.       In order to isolate these two substances
  from each other, the oleo-cirous mass, when well cleansed from
  sulphuric acid, was melted, and the half of its weight of alcohol
  was added to it; the union took place immediately with a
  promptitude truly extraordinary: upon cooling there resulted a
  hard mass, which was folded in new linen ; by gradual pressure
   the alcohol was expelled charged with oily matter, and the com
   pression was finished in gray paper.     The solid matter thus ob
   tained was not yet perfectly white, although treated several times
   with alcohol ; but by means of warm ether, which also dissolves
   it with extreme facility, we succeed much better in obtaining it
   of a perfect whiteness, . This substance ia dry, sonorous like

form soap this property

    Mr. Phillips London, of Cannon Street,*
 Sir,  — 1 beg of     you to present my respectful compliments to
 the  gentlemen of the Committee, and also to the Society, for
 their vote of thanks conveyed to me in your letters of 9th March
 and 21st of April last, expressing als6 their hopes that I would
 persevere in preserving mackerel upon the principle which I had
 the honour to communicate          to them in May IS 13, and which,
 they were pleased to say, they regard as an object of much na
 tional consequence.
     I have not, sir, been inattentive to the object ; on the con
 trary, I have caused to be cured this last season at Ramsgate,
 upwards of twenty-five thousand mackerel.
    There were cured at the same place this autumn, and sent to
 the West Indies, upwards of three hundred barrels of herrings,
 and in the last spring, about fifty barrels of sprats, all preserved
 upon the principles     which the Society did me the honour so
 highly   to approve,  and    which, I am fully persuaded, is the most
effectual, ceconomica!     and   expeditious method of curing fish ever
practised ; and I am strengthened in this hope by observing in
the fishing regulating bill, now depending, that encouragement
is held out by a new clause introduced               expressly for the pur
pose.
    In expectation that the mode of curing fish by immersion in
fully saturated brine of solid salt may become very general, par
ticularly for herrings, I am induced to inclose to the Society the
process more fully explained than it is in their volume for 181o,
and calculated for curing fish on shore, and in any situation how
ever exposed, even without any covering, as you will readily con
ceive that a surplus of salt on the surface of the brine will always
meet and quickly saturate any rain whatever that may fall into
the   reservoirs.
                   I am, with respect and esteem, sir,

                                               — The thanks of theSociety were
Vuted to Mr. Loudon for this communication.
                                                                          The

                             The Process.
    Reservoirs of any required size are to be provided in form of
tanners' pits, or backs, or vats, or casks, perfectly water-tight,
which should be about one-half filled with brine made with the
said salt of the spec. gravity of 1 206, water being 1-000, by dis
solving about 28 parts of the salt in 72 parts fresh water.
    The fish, as fresh as possible, are to be gutted or not, and
without delay plunged into this fully saturated brine in such
quantity as nearly to fill the reservoirs, and after remaining therein
 quite immersed for five or six days, they will be effectually struck,
and so fully impregnated with salt, as to be perfectly fit to be
rq>acked as usual with large grained
                                           " solid salt," and exported
to the hottest climates.
    Brine is known always to be weakest at the upper part.          To
 remedy this, and in order that the brine be kept up to a uniform
 saturation, a wooden lattice-work frame, of such size as easily
 to be let into the inside of the reservoirs, is sunk an inch or two
wider the surface of the brine, for the purpose of suspending
 upon it lumps of I or 2 lbs. or larger, of
                                               " 6olid salt," which ef
 fectually saturate whatever moisture may exude from the fish,
 and thus the brine will be continued of the utmost strength, and
 so long as any part of the lumps remain undissolved.          The so
 lidity of the lumps admits of their being applied several times,
 or whenever the reservoirs are replenished with fish ; and the
 brine, although repeatedly used, does not putrify, nor do the fish,
 if kept under the surface, ever become rancid.
    All provisions are best preserved by the above method, parti
 cularly bacon, which, when cured by that process, is not so lia
 ble to become rusty, as when done by the usual method of rub
 bing it with salt, and yet is more effectually cured.
    The solid salt may be procured in any quantity or of any size
 of Messrs. Londons, at the salt pit, NorWich, Cheshire ; Messrs.
 Smith, Marten, Smith and Co. America Square, London ; or
 Messrs. Whitehouse and Galan, Liverpool.

 would be by preparing them with potatoes in the following man

 nearly boiled sufficiently, one or more of the pickled mackerel
 to be then laid in the pan upon the boiling potatoes, and the

    XIII.  Some  further Particulars respecting Woolf's Patent
                        Boiler.   By the Editor.
 In    our seventeenth Volume, page 40, we gave an account of
 Mr. Woolf's invention for producing strong and durable boilers
~for steam-engines and other purposes, with an extract from his
 specification, and a quarto plate ; but we confined ourselves prin
 cipally to his boilers composed wholly of tubes, and calculated to
 bear a very high pressure of steam.      In the article alluded to, we
 informed our- readers that Mr. Woolf had in his specification also
 stated that his invention was applicable to the boilers of steam-
 engines already in use, and that he had given in his specification
 illustrations of some of the methods by which this might be ef
 fected.
     A correspondent having requested to be furnished with further
 information on this part of Mr. Woolf's invention, we willinglv
 devote a page or two to the subject. — In his specification Mr.
 Woolf remarks, that "in cases where it may be wished to increasa
 the power or production of steam without employing the very
 high degrees of heat, which boilers constructed on the principles
 before described, [viz. entirely of tubes,] are capable of sustain
 ing, my invention may be applied to the common oblong boiler
 now in very common use for steam-engines."             He then points
 out one method, by placing a row of tubes horizontally under
 and connecting them with the oblong boiler; and afterwards
 describes a method by which a very powerful oblong boiler may
 be produced, by dividing it into an upper and lower part, and
 connecting the two by vertical tubes.        Of such a boiler we have
 given a vertical and horizontal section in Plate I. (fig. 2 and 3).
  The horizontal section is taken through the middle of the ver
  tical tubes.
     Mr. Woolf remarks that " from the examples he has given"
  in his specification " no person acquainted with the nature and
  uses of boilers can be at a loss to apply his invention modified
  according to circumstances to any case that may present itself."
  This is abundantly evident from the description and accompany
  ing plate given in our seventeenth volume, and in the present
  short article : for instance, the benefit of Mr. Woolf's invention,
 so far as concerns      an increase of surface and consequence of
 steam by means of tubes, may be secured to the common oblong
                                                                  boiler

  boiler with the longitudinal flue, by introducing vertical tube*
  into the flue connecting the part above the flue with that below,
  by means of the said vertical tubes, in the same manner as the
  upper and lower part of the boiler, represented in Plate I. are
  connected with each other : or, if the boiler be constructed for
  the purpose, instead of one flue two flues may be carried through
  it with vertical tubes inserted in each ; (see fig. 3 :) and it will
  be advantageous that the vertical tubes should not range in a
.
  straight line behind each other, but rather take a zig-zag direc
  tion as in fig. 2. We are however of opinion, that this boiler, which
  would be more troublesome to construct than fig. 2 and 3, will
  not prove more efficient; for it is the vertical surfaces opposed to
                         '
   the direct course of the flame and heated air, that receive and
  transmit the principal part of the heat to the water, the vertical
  sides (which in this case form the sides of the flue) contributing
  but little to the effect, especially where there is room enough to
  construct a long boiler.       There is not, after the furnace of a
  boiler is once fairly healed, so much waste of heat even by the
  sides of a brick-work flue as some may imagine; for the effort
  of the flame and heated air is to find the most direct course to the
  chimney ; nor can any method better calculated to prevent this
  be easily imagined than the one pointed out by Mr. Woolf,
  namely, to interpose tubes in the way of the draft, that the
  flame and hot air may be obliged to impinge against them, and
  give out their heat before they reach the chimney.
       XIV. On     the Metallic Salts.     By A Correspondent,
                              To  Mr. Tilloch,
  Sir, — The        proper arrangement of the parts of a science is
  attended with     considerable  benefit towards its advancement, and
  the just definition of each particular part will not, I presume, be
  unattended by its corresponding utility.
     To set a doubtful point in our present chemical nomenclature
  at rest, alone induces me to trouble you with the following brief
  remarks: not that I am an advocate for generally received opi
  nions, or biassed by any particular theory, but solely actuated by
  a desire of eliciting truth.
     Your correspondent H. p. 463, vol. xlv. of your valuable
  Journal, says " that he has continually observed metallic salts
  to have an excess of acid ;" and concludes " that it is essential, to
  thern, and therefore, that there is ho neutral metallic salt.'*
  Fourcroy corroborates this, when he says, in his admirable work,
  (p. 69, vol. v. Nicholson's Translation) that
                                                    " the metallic salts
  have always an excess of acid/' and H. endeavours with very m-
                                                                genious

                              On tfte    Metallic Salts.                             45
      parous  arguments to prove that position ;            but in this, however,
      be appears to me to have failed.
            Admitting the correctness   of his experiments, which, having
      tried themmyself, I do explicitly, still I am inclined to consider
    that he has drawn wrong conclusions            from the data before him,
    and that his reasoning thereon is fallacious and in some measure
    contradictory.     I!e says that any dry metallic salt, moistened
    with water, and indicating acidity by the test, cannot in the dry
    state be considered neutral, it must in the drv state be an acid
   salt with excess of oxide caused by the evaporation of part of the
   acid in the process of drying and depositing its oxide upon solu
   tion:— Can the existence of a salt be imagined with each of its
   constituent parts in excess (2. n. acid and oxide) ? Certainly not.
       1 cannot conceive any period during the formation of a salt,
   that the action towards         chemical union would cease, whilst a
  portion of both        its constituents remain in contact and uncorn-
  fed; though it is easy to conceive that either one of the com
  ponent parts may preponderate as in the super and sub salts.                  It
  is impossible to try the experiment in a direct way, the salt be
      ing    dry state or combined only with the water of crystalliza
            ina
  tion; when, therefore, we cannot refer to direct experiment, we
  must be contented in drawing conclusions from analogy.
      Metallic salts are generally,            not universally, more soluble
                                               if
 according to the greater proportion of free acid, and                      abso
                                                                           it   is
 lutely necessary to have a little excess to induce solution                 this:
v
 is  not only the case with metallic, but also obtains with many
 of   the earthy salts, such as the sulphates, phosphates, &e.               Arid
 *ere his argument allowed, that the salt was not neutral, because
 it
     required excess of acid for its solution, these also would be con-
 (idered super salts      :  now,    it    not doubted that sulphate of lime
                                          is
 is  not neutral, because           it    scarcely soluble without excess of
                                         is
 acid.      But, he says, before the free acid can be neutralized by
 In    alkali, the oxide       isprecipitated      this
                                                    :       indeed the fact, and
                                                            is
did     it not take place there would be no solution             :   only proves,
                                                                     it
therefore, that its tendency towards solution decomposes part of
the salt to support the remaining               part in the water.
     Besides, the very evidence both of acid and oxide upon solu
tion clearly proves that they were actually combined, and formed
part of the salt when crystallized,              and not caused       by
                                                                       the evapo
ration of part of the acid             in  drying      were
                                                        :    this the case, there
would then only be            asuperabundance of oxide, and consequently,
rather        sub than
                 a         a super salt.
 I      am decidedly of opinion           ; First, from the acid or super-salts
he;ng      more    soluble    than   the  neutral    or than the sub-salts; Se
condly,      from   the   salt  dissolving   without    any precipitation on the
affusion of acidulated water              ;and Thirdly, from the decomposi
                                                                              tion

to afford a sufficient quantity of free acid to induce solution; that
it is rational to conclude, that the free acid in those                 metallic salts
now called  neutral, does not in the least militate against their
neutrality when crystallized.
   With these observations, which I submit to the consideration
of more able proficients, I trust, the correctness of your corre

for the advantage of the chemical nomenclature.

   comparative Anatomy         of Animals aiid Vegetables.                  By Mrs.

                                   To   Mr. Tillock.
Sir, —    I  have had the happiness to make what appears to
me rather a curious discovery, respecting the brains of animals
in general, which I hope and trust in this age of inquiry may be
of some use in clearing up a little of the darkness that still exists
respecting the powers and formation of the brain; especially its
connexion with the nerves and muscles, and the consequent
effect arising to them.
    Having been some time employed in studying comparative
anatomy, merely for the purpose of enabling me to draw up a
comparison between the vegetable and animal frame, and having
at last conquered it sufficiently to send you the sketch you will
receive with this letter, which in some measure (though poor)
will, I natter myself, show the exact powers of plants, I wenl
to Dawlish to recover the effects of a too severe study ; but re
solved to make use of that opportunity to examine the Zoophytes
While dissecting them, I remembered to have heard that it was
once supposed that the brain might possess a sort of vapour
and it occurred to me to try.     Finding in the anemone a quan
tity of brain, taking a small quantity of ifon the point of a knife

letter, and shall feel much pleasure in laying them before our readers ne:
month.    In the mean time we hasten to comply with our learned and                      i:
defatigable correspondent's request, by giving publicity to her impbrta
and valuable discoveries in their present shape. — EDIT.

     cover the glass with bubblesof air! It continued to flow for about
     a couple   of hours, then gradually lessened ; but that change
     .seemed rather to be occasioned by the drying up of the medium
     through which the air was seen, than the decrease of it; for as
     soon as a little water was added with the finger, the air began
     again to flow, and continued a couple of hours more ; then
,i   died away.     But as I depended on knowing the brain of the
     anemone by its peculiar conformation,      I thought it better to
     try a creature that had a decided head and brains ; and therefore
     took the prawn, the shrimp, the lobster.     The two first gave
      mAb. air, but not so much as the anemone ; the lobster gave
      more, and had some curious particulars respecting it. However,
      1 was not yet quite satisfied;     but, the moment I returned to
      Exeter, contrived to get my butcher to send me a sheep's head
      the moment it was killed : — I had it within half an hour.         I
      took a small slice not so thick as a card, and placed it on the
     glass of my compound microscope, under a double f tower ; there
      was liquid enough to show the quantity of air that escaped for
     the first two hours, and it could be compared to nothing but an
     apple when placed in water under the receiver of an air-pump,
     which by pumping released the air within. I afterwards tried the
     brain of a pig, a lamb, and many kinds of fish ; it was all the
     same: only tliat the animal gave most, and that the mackerel,
     &c. had a triangular bladder: I cannot help thinking it vapour,
     rather than air only, as after the bubbles have run from small
     to large^ and burst, —-they leave a very diminutive speck behind,
     which appears to me to be matter, remaining after the decom
     position. A number of gentlemen, physicians,           and surgeons,
      have seen it : some suggested it might occasion the vis insita of
     the muscles ; but this cannot be, since in the account I here add1,
      the same vis insita is found in the muscles of the plant ; and
      they have neither nerves nor brain.       But I will venture to add
     one idea which has occurred to me, — whether the sudden stopping
      of that vapour by a concussion of the brain, might not occasion
     the total torpidity of limb, and a loss of the organ belonging t»
     that side of the brain, thus injured. Or irritating the brain might
     increase the quantity of vapour, and thus produce convulsion*
     to the corresponding limb.      But this is a consideration for wiser
     heads than mine, and to the order of physicians and surgeons        i
     leave it,  well assured that they will make use of every accidental
     fact thus presented to them.         Perhaps no study has proceeded
     farther in practical utility and scientific research than ana
     tomy;    and to no order of men are we so much indebted. for tha
     alleviation of the sufferings of mankind, and to whom          1  feel
     myself peculiarly happy     in dispi        though  from   an obscure
     individual, my humble meed of admiration and praise. No
                                                                     other

  other part of the head gives a vapour, and I know not any other
  part except the lungs from which air may be drawn in this pe
  culiar manner.       That Cuvier was perfectly wrong in supposing
  this part to be the intestines of the zoophyte is certain; the brain
  has that peculiar shape which no other part in the smallest degree
  resembles, and which is alike in all animals, insects, zoophytes,
  &c. I was indeed most anxious to prove whether the nctenia
  possessed a brain and verves ; for I never yet saw or dissected
  an insect (ever so small) torpid or insignificant that had not
  those parts ; or any being that deserved t he name of a feeling
 animal, which had not both brain and nerves ; for surely the
 being that is sensible of pain. or pleasure, must have tho?e parts,
 from which those feelings remit ; and as there is in each part,
 that peculiar mark, which distinguishes them when seen, they can
 not be mistaken : thus the muscle is known by its cantractingr
 power, by its increasing hardness when cut, and by its vis iusita
 possessed by no other part of the body, in either insect, animal,
 plant, or human being. The nerve is known by its being that
 remarkable link which is the source or vehicle of communication
 between the brain and muscle ; and serving probably as a pass
 age for that gas, which may produce so many curious phaeno
 mena in the human frame, while the brain is that peculiar formed
 matter which in every creature that feels, has the same appear
 ance and consistency, and may always be likened to a great fat
 worm.

 XVI. On Citric Acid.           By Samuel Parkes, F.L.S.M.G.S.
                                   &c.*
There        is a peculiar  acid in the juice of lemons, citrons, limes,
and a variety       of  other  fruits, different in some of its proper
ties from all others, and known to chemists by the name of ci
tric acid.      The ancients, it appears, made no use of the juice
of these fruits except as an antidote against poison. Formerly
the citric was supposed to be identical with the tartaric acid ;
but the citric acid does not decompose muriate of potash, nor
ttilphate of lime, like oxalic acid.            Georgius in the Stock
holm Memoirs proposed            the  separation of this acid from the
mucilage of the juice by cold ; but the ingenious Scheele was the
first who exhibited this acid in a solid form. To accomplish this,
    * From the " Chemical Essays," in 5 vols. l?nio. just published ; and of
which we shall give an analysis in our next.
                                                                          he

 he      adoptedmerely the same method which he had employed to
purify and    crystallize the tartaric acid.          It consists in separating
 the real acid     by  means    of carbonate       of lime, and then decom
 posing   the  citrate   of  lime   by   the   intermedium of diluted sul
 phuric acid ; a process which has since been followed throughout
 Europe ; for we have no other means of putting this acid into a
 crystalline form.       Having myself had some experience in this
 process by frequently superintending its progress, and more than
 ouce to the extent of several hogsheads of juice in one opera
 tion, I shall now, with some confidence in their correctness, pro
 ceed to give what appear to me to be the best directions for ob
 taining a successful result.
     The juice, which is imported in pipes and hogsheads, should
 be drawn off into a large open vessel ; and a square vat made of
        very proper for the purpose.            In this vessel the juice

         is                                                                     to is
     saturated with lime,         bythe gradual addition (lest the effer
 vescence by the disengagement of carbonic acid should occasion
 an
     overflow) of clean soft ehalk, or whiting.              Care must be taken
to note down the quantity of carbonate of lime employed, which
should be added till         it occasions no further effervescence, and
until the liquor shows no signs of acidity on test paper.                   When
there      room, the better way would be to put the intended quan

to wet        well with water, and then to pump in the acid

pernatant liquor is therefore to be drawn off *, and the precipi
tate preserved for use.
    When the supernatant liquor is removed, the precipitate, or
citrate of lime, is to be passed through a sieve, and then fre
quently washed with warm water, till all the remaining mucilage
and other soluble impurities be entirely washed off.                         This will
be known, when the whole has remained at rest for some time,
by the water coming off clear and tasteless.                        The precipitate
having      been   thus    well    washed,      let  it   be  treated   with diluted
sulphuric      acid,  in  the    following    manner      :  For  every ten pounds
of chalk or whiting, which has been employed in the process, it
is necessary to take the quantity of nine pounds of the best oil
of vitriol of commerce of the specific gravity of 1*84, or 1'845,
which is to be diluted with about seven gallons, or 56 lbs. of
 water f. This diluted sulphuric acid is to be gradually poured
 upon the citrate of lime J, and the whole mixture well stirred,
for a considerable time, with a strong wooden spatula, that there
may be no chance of any of the citrate remaining unbroken, and
consequently unacted upon by the mineral acid.                         The more ef
 fectually to guard against this, it is advisable, just before the last
portions of oil of vitriol are added, to pass the whole mixture a
second time through the sieve : otherwise, notwithstanding the
 utmost care, some lumps of citrate of lime may still remain un-
 peuetrated by the sulphuric acid, which would occasion a loss,
 and probably deception.
     In conducting this part of the process, I have noticed an ap
pearance worth mentioning to the practical chemist.                           It being
necessary to stir up the mass very frequently during the gradual
 addition of the sulphuric acid, I have observed that whenever
the citrate of lime became nearly all decomposed, and the earth
mostly saturated with sulphuric acid, the sulphate of lime preci
pitates quicker and quicker after every addition of this acid, and
that the supernatant liquor considerably increases in quantity.
The latter circumstance is occasioned by the increased density
 of the precipitate; and both appearances should always be
 looked for, as they afford a good criterion for judging of the
completion of the operation.                 It is however proper to remark,
   »  For this purpose some use plugs at different heights in the vat ; but a Syphon
with   a stop-cock is better, as with it the liquor may be drawn off perfectly close,
and without any danger of accident.
   f  Proust employed diluted sulphuric acid of 1-150 sp. grav. But on looking
to my table of the sp. grav. of diluted sulphuric acid, (see Phil. Mag. Sept.
1812.) I see that four parts water will reduce the strongest sulphuric acid            of
commerce to that sp. grav.; and 1 have found that this is far short of the dilu
tion necessary to produce the best result.                                    . . .

 that it would not be prudent         for the operator to rely solely on
 these   appearances ; for, if he is to ensure the best possible ma
  nagement of the process, he must have recourse to the agency of
  chemical tests, as they will afford the only sure criterion by which
  the real state of the saturation of the lime can be known.
     In many chemical operations, preparations of barytes, or a
 simple solution of this earth in water, are employed to detect the
                                   ~
 presence of sulphuric acid.         But as citrate of barytes would im
 mediately precipitate on the addition of barytic water to a solu
 tion of citric acid, this reagent cannot be conveniently employed
 to show when the exact quantity of sulphuric acid has been used.
 It is necessary, therefore, to have some other test, and this may
be found in the joint employment             of acetate of lead and nitric
acid : and although          this might have suggested itself to any
chemist who had thought on the subject, I confess I am indebted
for the idea to a person who has for several years done much in
the business, and who tells me he has long employed these two
articles for this purpose with perfect success.           Whenever the sa
turation of the citrate of lime is nearly completed, and the ope
rator is fearful of supersaturating                it,

be formed and precipitate, which precipitate will be immediately
                                                                                       "

contrary, should too much sulphuric acid have been used, there
 will be a mixed precipitate of citrate of lead and sulphate of lead              ;
 and the latter of these salts not being soluble in nitric acid, leads
 to the detection of an excess of the decomposing acid.
    But to return to the process.            The consequence of this af
fusion of the citrate of lime with sulphuric acid             that the latter
                                                                  is,

 the mixed liquor is afterwards to be concentrated by evaporation.
 Where the citric acid is made as an article of manufacture, a
 boiler of lead* will be the most convenient for this purpose.
 In this the acid may be kept continually steaming without any
 danger, until it acquire the specific gravity of about 1*130.         It
will then be prudent to withdraw the firef entirely, and proceed
 to remove the acid into a smaller vessel of lead, which should be
 so fixed within an iron pan of boiling water, as to form a com
 plete balneum murice.        In this bath the fluid may be further
concentrated by steaming, until it become so much reduced in
 bulk as to render it necessary to remove it into another water-
bath still smaller, but constructed in the same manner as the
 former.     In this last vessel the liquor is to be further evaporated
until it acquire the consistence of very thin molasses, and then
 it should be watched with the greatest attention for the pellicle
 to appear, which may now be expected to arise on the surface.
 This pellicle will first show itself in small detached spots, and
t>y degrees will increase in size and number till the whole of the
liquor h nearly covered with them.            It should then be imme
diately   taken  out  of the bath,  and  laid aside to cool and crystal
 lize J. It is of the utmost consequence to attend to this circum
 stance ; for so much of the fluid is evaporated before the pellicle
appears, that, if it were to remain half an hour longer, the whole
 might be carbonized, and reduced to a dry mass.
    It is likewise proper to remark, that however carefully the
process may have been conducted, the whole of the calcareous
earth will not precipitate totally while the supernatant liquor is
loaded with the citric acid ; for we know that this is capable of
holding the citrate of lime in solution §.       To remedy this, there
fore, it will. be requisite, as the acid becomes concentrated, to
   * The bottom of tin's boi'er
                                  should be made of one continued sheet of lead,
not less than ten pounds to the foot, though five-pound lead will be sufficient
for the sides. But where saving; of expense is not the first object, it is best to
have the vessel of one entire sheet of lead, by which all solder may be avoided.
   .f In building the fire-place, it should be entirely covered with a continued
row of iron plates, which are to be supported at each end by the walls of the
fire-place. These should not be less than one inch thick ; and if they are cast,
only six inches broad : it will be less expense to repair them whenever any       of
them are worn nut by the action of the fire.          It is by these plates the leaden
boiler is to be supported.
   i When r-emovrd, it should remain undisturbed for three or four days, that
the largest possible quantity of crystals may be obtained from the liquor. After
this time has elapsed, the mother-water may be drained from them, as, after
that period, it will be in vain to expect a furl her increase without a further abs
traction of water from the mothers by a fresh evaporation.

add     occasionally a small portion of diluted sulphuric acid*,
which    will arrest the lime, and precipitate it. To this end, the
 steaming should every now and then be discontinued for some
 hours, to allow time for the sulphate of lime to separate, which
 otherwise    would prevent the crystallization of the pure citric
 acidf; for Crell has shown, that a very small quantity of cal
 careous earth will have this effect                J.
                                             Where the product is de
 signed   for crystallization, it will not be necessary to attend much
 to the temperature of the room ; for I have found that the cry
stals shoot equally well in a warm as in a cold situation.
    The crystals thus produced wi 1 sometimes, though not gene
 rally, be needle -formed § ; and, as the process is usually con
 ducted, they will be nearly as dark as the brownest sugar.        In
 deed, every writer on citric acid, whom I have consulted, tells us,
 that the first crystals will be either dark brown, or black ; but
 I am confident, if the article has not been burnt during the eva
poration, that this is chiefly owing to the mucilage not having
been sufficiently washed out of the citrate of lime before it is
treated with the sulphuric acid ; for I have more than once seen
crystals of the first crop, of a very bright light brown, and even
distinct in their form ; and such I conceive they always will be
when the proper precautions have been taken.          However, though
the crystals in any of these states may very well answer most of
the purposes to which they are applied by the calico-printer, it
is sometimes desirable to have them quite pure ; and by dis
solving and- crystallizing the acid three or four times successively
in pure water        very white and beautiful solid crystals of citric
                   ||,
    * A single drop of this acid will be       asufficient test, at any time, to show
whether the concentrated citric acid holds any citrate of lime in solution.
f      A small excess of sulphuric acid   is not injurious, hut will rather favour the
crystallization of the citric acid, though, perhaps, only inasmuch as       it  tends to
destrov the mucilage.
 \    In opposition to this, Westrumb says that most of the citric acid, even when
crystallized, contains   a considerable quantity of lime.      However, where this         is
suspected,   it may quickly be known by dissolving some of the crystals in water,
and, when the solution      has been saturated with ammonia, by treating         it with
an oxalate of that alkali, which,    ifthere be lime, will immediately separate        in
                                                                                      it
a  palpable form.
    §   Ithas been repeatedly said by the writers on citric acid, that the crystals
produced by the first evaporation are always needle-formed; hut am inclined
                                                                        I

freed from the mucilage, and the solution of citric acid not evaporated beyond
the due point of concentration,      before     be laid aside for crystallization.

may always be procured from the liquor of the first boiling.
 J    The most ceconomical way of conducting this part of the process         is  to em
ploy-very little more water than
                                     is absolutely necessary to dissolve the crystals,
and then allow sufficient time for the impurities to subside before the solution
is  again set apart for crystallization.       Itwould add to the perfection of the
 crystals, in point of figure, were not only the first, but every subsequent solu
 tion passed through     clean leather filter, previous to its being allowed lu shoot.

acid may at any time be produced *, and if the first solution of
the brown crystals be passed through a skin of wash-leather,
Stretched upon a frame, so much of the colouring matter will be
abstracted that two or three solutions in clear water will be suffi
cient to give crystals of the desired purity.
    There is another point respecting the conducting of this busi
ness which deserves our notice, and that is the management of
the mother-waters.         In the manufacture of every kind of salt,
the profit verv much depends upon the oeconomy which is ob
served in reducing these to a solid or a marketable form. But in
this article, the high value of the crystals, and the peculiar diffi
 culties attendant on the reduction of these residuary liquors,
 render this part of the subject important to those who operate
 on a large scale.       Whenever this acid is first boiled to a suffi
 cient strength for crystallization, the small excess of sulphuric
 acid carbonizes a portion either of the acid or the mucilage ;
 and therefore, when several parcels of juice have been concen
 trated, there will be a considerable quantity of very black un-
 crystallizable mother-liquor.         This kind of residuum has given
 much trouble to some operators, and it has often been thrown
 away as useless.        By the following management, however, the
 whole    of   the citric acid which it contains may be turned to a
 good account, and produce fair and clean crystals.            The process
 is as follows :
     Whatever the quantity of mother-liquor may be, let it be di
 luted with ten or twelve times its measure of pure water, and the

     On referring to my notes, while operating on some large par
 cels of lime-juice,     I  find the following entry, which       given in
                                                                  is

                                             I
 process   which I    have   since acquired.   Three casks of lime-juice,
  which measured together 270 gallons, were drawn off into a
  large wooden vessel        ;and to this were added 118 lbs. of best
  whiting, which completely saturated it. When the citrate of
  lime had precipitated,        the supernatant liquor was taken away
    » Though the first product maybe in
                                           needle-shaped crystals, the acid when
                                                                          - .

                                                                              and

                                 On Citfic Acid.                               55
 and reserved       for another purpose*.         The precipitate was tlien
 carefully    washed    with  hot water from the worm-tub of the la
boratory still, a»d this was drawn off the next morning.                  It was
afterwards washed several times with cold water; in all seven
times, the first washing only being with hot water.                  The water
which was drawn off at the third washing was considerably co
loured.       While the citrate of lime was precipitating completely,
after the last washing, and I allowed it due time to subside, in
order to separate as much as possible of the water which rested
on its surface, I drew off into another vessel the contents of five
pipes more. of lime-juice, which in the whole measured 450 gal
lons.       This quantity required 149 pounds of whiting for its com
plete     saturation  f.
     The precipitate now obtained was treated and washed with
the same attention and care as the former, to separate the whole
of the malate and acetate X of lime, the extractive matter, and
the mucilage.          Both the precipitates were then removed to a
leaden cistern, and 500 lbs. of soft water were poured on them,
which enabled us very thoroughly to mix the whole.                       2401bs.
of oil of vitriol of the specific gravity of 1-845 were now diluted
with 256 lbs. or 32 gallons, wine measure, of soft^vater, and this
diluted sulphuric acid was immediatelv, whilst hot from the mu
tual action of the two fluids on each other, gradually poured in
successive portions into the leaden cistarn upon the above-men
tioned mixture of citrate of lime and water.                   While this was
doing, two of the workmen never ceased stirring up the whole
with large wooden spatula^ the more effectually to prevent any
part of the citrate from escaping the action of the sulphuric
acid.
     Notwithstanding this, I perceived that the precipitate conglo
merated very much on every addition of the sulphuric acid ; a
circumstance which was occasioned, as I afterwards discovered,
by using this acid in too concentrated a state.                   There is be
sides another evil attending this ; for as sulphuric acid, fully
 concentrated, will convert the citric into acetic acid, there will
 always be a danger of lessening the quantity of the produce, when
    * It was designed to separate the water by freezing or evaporation, and then
 treat   the remaining mdic acid and mucilage *ith -nitric acid, with the view of
 obtaining oxalic acid.
    + Lime-juice is generally stronger than that of lemons ; and when it is of the
 full standard strength, it will take half a pound of chalk to every gallon of the
 juice.
     f It may be worth remarking, that ordinary juice not only takes less lime,
 but that sometimes even a considerable portion of what is used does not remain
 in the vat, for it is drawn off with the malic and acetic acids; the m ilate and
  the acetate of lime being both soluble salts. Hence the necessity of always em
  ploying a chemical test to determine the quantity of sulphuric acid required for
  the subsequent operation.
                                       D4                                      th«

5G                               Oil Citric jfcid.
the oil of vitriol is not sufficiently diluted before it be employed.
Indeed, from the last operations which I superintended, I am
led to believe that it cannot be ceconoinical to use this acid in a
higher state of concentration than one part of the sulphuric acid
of commerce to six parts of water.          The whole quantities used,
were lime-juice 720 gallons, carbonate of lime 267 lbs., sulphuric
acid 240 lbs., water (besides the quantity which was before in
 the nitrate of lime*) 756 lbs.
     Several other parcels of citrate of lime were afterwards treated
 with sulphuric acid properly diluted, and these inconveniences
 avoided ; but it is not in my power to furnish the amount of the
 crystals that were produced from any of these parcels, as I dis
 posed of my share of the whole of the citric acid in a state of
 solution, and the task of concentrating it for crystallization fell
 into other hands.
     From other experiments, however, I have reason to conclude
 that 20 gallons of good juice will generally give 18 lbs. of dry
  citrate of lime, and that if the whole process be well conducted,
 these 18 pounds of citrate will furnish 10 pounds of good white
 crystals of citric acidf.
     A different ^method has been proposed by Richter for pro
 curing the crystallized citric acid ; and the author of the process
 says (Mr. J. Thomson's Notes to Fourcroy) that the crystals
 produced in this way are much finer than those which are fur
  nished by the old method.       It consists in saturating lemon-juice
  with potash, and in adding to the filtrated solution, a solution of
  acetate of lead so long as any white precipitate continues to be
  formed.
      In this process the citric acid unites of course to the metal,
  and the acetic acid with the alkali.       The citrate of lead, after
  being well washed with water, to separate any of the acetate
  which may adhere to      it, to be digested with
                                 is                    sufficient quantity
                                                          a
 of diluted sulphuric acid, and stirred frequently.           During this
  digestion sulphate of lead        formed,
                                      is      and  the  disengaged citric
 acid exists in the supernatant liquor.        By evaporating this with
a    gentle heat, beautiful crystals of citric acid will be formed.              -.
     As the citric acid takes the lead directly from the acetous
  acid, the citrate of lead may be obtained            by
                                                     adding lemon-juice
  to the acetate of lead.      But the mucilage and other impurities

washed, as is   frequently the case,  adilution of three parts of water to one part
of oil of vitriol may be sufficient, as there will be much water in state of mix
                                                                      a

 f   It  has been stated that " the quantity of solid citric acid

juice varies from 14 to 18 ounces."        confess, however, that

able to procure this proportion from any of the parcels on which      I  operated.
                                                                                are

 rated with an       alkali,
     I caniiot speak of this process from my own experience               ; and
knowing       that    the most    beautiful  crystals may    be  procured by
 Scheele's process, 1 have felt no desire of repeating this of
Richter, especially as it is more expensive, and the use of lead is
objectionable where the crystallized acid is intended for internal
and domestic purposes.
    Fourcroy proposed sending proper persons over to America, to
collect the vast quantities of limes and lemons which are annually
lost there ; to saturate the expressed juice with chalk, and to
eend the washed and dried precipitate closely packed in barrels
to France, where it might be decomposed, and the citric acid
obtained pure.          Whether any Frenchmen ever embraced this
proposal,      I  have  not  learned ; but I know that some few persons
have gone from England to different parts of Italy for this pur
pose, and that considerable quantities of the citrate of lime have
been imported from thence to Great Britain.
     Having been introduced to a person, who some years ago formed
an establishment of this sort in Sicily, I have learned several im
portant circumstances relating to this business, which have never
yet been given to the public.          I have also been favoured with the
 perusal of a great part of the correspondence which passed on
the occasion ; and having obtained leave to print the whole, or
 any part of these letters, I shall subjoin such extracts as I con
 ceive will be interesting to those who may be desirous of acquiring
 more information on the subject.
     In the first letter, which is dated Messina, the Cth of September
 1808, the writer says,
                                " The time of pressing is generally in the
latter end of the month of November or December, for till that
 period* the lemons yield little or no juice."
     " The country round Messina consists of mountains of im
 mense height, rising one above another, and thickly covered to
 the very tops with fruit-trees, chiefly olives and lemons, which
 render this place the very best in the world for procuring lemon-
juice. The quay surpasses most others, extending for a mile aud
 a half, close to the edge of which ships lie in 20 fathoms water.
 Formerly a range of superb houses, perfectly uniform, extended
 the whole length of this marino, or quay ; but ever since the
 earthquake these magnificent mansions lie in ruins.
     " As soon as the country people press the juice, they bring it
 in hereffor sale. The buyers do not afford it warehouse-room, but
 roll it into the street, exposed to the weather and to the heat of
    * At this time of the year 200 lemons are generally required to furnish a gal
 lon  of juice: there are, in consequence, presses so constructed that they can
  squeeze many thousands of lemons at once.

 provide casks to rack it into, when he takes it away.
                                                                              the

the suh, where it remains till an opportunity offers for shipping
it*. It is therefore not surprising that so much is imported that
is musty and perished, and that the English merchants often
find it so bad on its arrival in England as to create a difficulty in
procuring for it even the amount of the import duty."
    In a letter dated Messina, September 30, 1808, he says,
*e The
         pressing continues till the following March, the quantity
of juice produced increasing every month, in proportion as the
fruit become riper, and the necessity of gathering them greater.
The juice is sold by the salm, which is a measure equal to 21
gallons English."

                        Again, April 15.th, 1809.   " I have hitherto
found no difficulty in saturating the chalk in any quantity ; but
the drying is extremely tedious and difficult ; it requires very hot
and dry weather, which we have had little or none of as yet.         \
have had parcels lie upwards of a fortnight before they became
perfectly dry.    When spread out for this purpose it occupies a
Tast deal of room ; and when the drying places are all full, I am
obliged to stand still, although I have procured the use of a vast
 terrace belonging to a convent not far distant.         The citrate,

However, at the expiration of two or three days, when I began
to fill up and cooper the casks, I found the article so heated that ,
I was obliged immediately to turn it all out again to dry it bet
ter.    The cistern* in which I work is capable of containing 12
pipes ; but notwithstanding the large size of the apparatus, the
effervescence occasions me much trouble ; and this I attribute to
the chalk being sifted to so fine a powder.      Neither the monks
nor any of the inhabitants seem to have the slightest curiosity to
know what the article is, although, until it is dry, it continually
occasions a most agreeable odour."        "According to your direc
tions,   I  have  made  inquiry respecting the fruit which grows on
the coasts of Barbary, and 1 find there is a considerable quantity
of lemons, but they yield very little juice, being of the bergamot
species, and have very thick rinds f."
   June 22, 1809. — " The storing of lemon-juice is here a most
difficult and expensive thing, since the soldiers occupy all the
places formerly used for this purpose, and also many of the con
vents J, which have all very large repositories."
   July 4, 1S09.— " I have been under the necessity of hiring a
large room, formerly the refectory of the convent, the door of
which opens on the terrace where I dry.          This serves also to
store   the  citrate when  dry, and at times, when the weather looks
squally, to bring it under cover; a very necessary precaution in
 this climate, as the rain descends in torrents unknown to us in
 England, and would very soon wash away every thing ; so that
you see, this business, when conducted on a large scale, require*
plans and precautions which nothing but actual operations can
 point out to us.     With each shipment I have furnished the mea
 sures of the juice I have used, and the exact quantity of chalk
 employed in each batch, from a book I keep for this purpose;
 and the measuring, the weighing, and the whole process has
 been constantly under my own inspection ; for without my pre
 sence the men will do nothing.        This hot country destroys in a
 great measure the energies of mind and body."
   * In another letter he
                          says,
                                " It is impossible at any price to procure a cistern
of wood in this place capable of holding the necessary quantity.          There is no
wood to be obtained in the island fit for  it,   and much less could a workman be
found who would be capable of putting     it   together.   Even baskets for draining
must he sent from England, as none but very small ones are to be had in Sicily,
and those very poor and slender."
 f    The Baron Lahontan relates that there are citrons in some parts of Canada,
which instead of a rind have only a   single skin, and that the fruit
                                                                    is  as wholesome
as the rootis  dangerous, the juice of the latter being a   subtile poison. He pro
ceeds to say that in the year 1684 he saw an Iroquoise woman, who was following
 her deceased husband, swallow    a   portion of this juice, which produced instant
death. See Lahontan's Voyages to North America, 8vo, 1735, vol.          i. p. 250.
  t  These are chiefly decayed establishments, which derive a considerable part of
 their revenues from letting out large apartments for storehouses and other pur-

      June 22, 1810. — "        I   find as much difference in lemon-juice
   as in wine, and both have more or less body according to the
  particular soil on which the fruit grows.             When fresh squeezed,
  ail seems equally sharp and good.               The hot weather, however,
  is the test, and much will not bear it ; it often changes very
  quickly, and a mawkish vinegar-sort of taste alone remains.
  Though the early juice resists the heat the best, I can positively
  assert that, with the utmost care, there is no certainty of pre
  serving its native sharpness in the hot months but by the addi
  tion of lime or some other agent."
     From a table of the produce of this establishment in the years
   1S09 and 1810, it appears that 74,9(54 gallons of juice were
  used, and 35,01 7 lbs. of chalk, which gave 49,902 lbs. avoirdu
  pois of citrate.       The quantity of citrate produced by every lb.
  of chalk varied from 1 9 to 27 ounces, and from every gallon of
 juice from 8| to 12|oz. avoirdupois.                The disparity in the pro
  ducts from the chalk is ascribed to the use of an equal quantity,
  to every kind of juice, which was very injurious. Dize says that
  64| lbs. of chalk gave him 20 lbs. of dry citrate; but I have never
 been able to procure this quantity, and I conceive that he had
 not freed it entirely from the mucilage by washing. Prousf (who
 operated on the fruit of Andalusia) speaks of 30oz. of dry citrate
 from a pound of chalk, and this, 1 a:n confident, is the utmost
 that can be procured.
     Before I conclude this part of the Essay, it will be right to
 apprize those who may intend to embark in this business, that it
 will be necessary to send the whiting from England, as neither
 lime, nor chalk, nor any other suitable ingredient (the burning
 of marble being expensive) for the purpose is to be found in Si
 cily. In sending out whiting or chalk, it will be advisable not to
 rely entirely on one shipment ; for, should the calcareous earth
 he lost, it is probable the whole purchase of juice would be
 spoiled before a fresh supply could be written for, and actually
 arrive in the island*.

    * It should also be known that all the resident merchants have an inveterate
jedousy against any new settlers amongst them, and therefore strangers will be
disappointed if they go with an expectation of receiving the usual facilities in bill
negotiations, whatever may be the recommendations       which they may take out
with them.     Every article which is :he produce of the Island, must be paid for
in hard cash, and the purchasers should be provided accordingly. . Considering
these, and some otlierdifnculties, which I have already stated, (and I have felt uo
desire to conceal any circumstance, however unfavourable, which is connected
with this subject,) 1 am inclined to think that, by purchasing lemon-juice in
London or Liverpool, at favourable opportunities, citrate of lime might be
made in England nearly as cheap as it could be imported from Sicily, with all the
inconveniences and disadvantages which must inevitably attend its formation in
a distant country. However, having stated the different facts, the reader will be
able to form hit own opinion.

             XVII.    On the Ventilation    of Coal Mine;.
                        By A Correspondent.
 The frequent accidents that have lately occurred in the collieries
ia the neighbourhood of Newcastle and Durham, in consequence
 of the inflammation of the carburetted hydrogen so abundant in
the coal-mines of those districts, have justly excited the attention
 and sympathy of the public at large for the fate of the unfor
tunate sufferers.
   It is extremely probable that the increase of accident arises
from a growing difficulty in ventilating the coal-mines as their
depth increases from the surface ; an evil which must be un
avoidably increasing in all old coal-fields throughout the king
dom.     Unless, therefore, some radical mode of circulating an
abundant supply of pure atmospheric air be devised, so as to re
place daily and hourly the gas as it becomes generated, these
explosions    and concomitant scenes of misery and distress are
Sore likely to increase than to diminish.
   Some severe censures have lately appeared against the abilities
and judgement of the directors of the principal coal-mines of
the North.       It is evident that these remarks have been ha
zarded by persons otherwise highly respectable for talent, but
who seem little conversant with the practical details and diffi
culties of one of these works.       Strictures thus freely and indis
criminately   bestowed   are  not likely to be productive of much of
that general benefit which it seems the wish of all to obtain.
   Feeling with many others an earnest wish to diminish the
chances of that frightful calamity which hangs over the finest
coal-mines in the world, I submit to the public what seeim to
me a probable remedy.
   Let every large colliery have an air-pit ; the place and situa
tion of it in relation to the pumping or winding pit or pits, I
leave to the judgement of the viewer.        In sinking, let the joints
and openings be properly filled with mortar that will harden in
damp situations so as to make it as air-tight as possible.        Near
to it place a steam-engine of about ten-horses power : this will
work an air-pump or cylinder of six feet in diameter with a
power of compression equal to half a pound upon the square inch
of the piston.     Let the air-pump be placed in the mouth of the
air-pit,  and  the apparatus so contrived as to produce an exhaus
tion in the pit both in the ascending and descending stroke ; —
the mouth of the pit of course to fit close to the cylinder, to pre
vent the air from passing inwardly.
   If this engine travels at the rate of 200 feet in one minute, it
                                                                    will

    452             On the Ventilation     of Coal-Mines.
    will pump out of the pit and its workings in that time 6000          feet
    of contaminated air : consequently an equal volume of pure            at
    mospheric air will descend by the down-cast pit, and be circu
    lated through the air courses.
        If the extent of the under-ground workings be equal to a mile ;
    400 yards in the direction of the rise ; and the height of the ex
    cavated opening, after allowing for the space occupied by the
    pillars in a vein six feet in thickness, be taken at four feet, — this
    will give a total excavation of 25,000,000 of cubical feet, or a
    magazine of air of this extent composed of the fatal gas, atmo
    spheric air and carbonic acid gas : this quantity, though great,
    would by means of the engine be entirely removed in three days,
    and the void replaced by pure air.
        I shall now proceed to show that a supply of 6000 feet of
    fresh air per minute, is much more than is necessary for the exi
    gencies of the under-ground workings, so far as combustion and
    respiration are concerned.
        According to the accurate experiments of Messrs. Allen and
    Pepys, a man requires 310 cubical inches of atmospheric air
    in one minute for the purpose of respiration.          Let us suppose
    that one hundred men are necessary to carry on the work of the
    mine, and that 200 candles are required to give sufficient light
    to all the departments of the work : let the quantity       of. air ne
    cessary for each candle be taken at twice the quantity requisite
    for   a man
              ;    let the complement of the horses be taken at 30,
    and the quantity of air necessary for their respiration be esti
    mated as equal to that consumed by the men and candles.
    These items of waste taken collectively will not amount to more
    than 200 cubical feet per minute.          Whereas the engine has
    powers to replace into the mine in the same space 30 times as
    rcuch, or 600() cubical feet.
        As the subject occurs to me at present, only two objections,
    are likely to be urged to this mode of ventilation      ;  namely, its
    first cost and subsequent expense and the probability of its be
                                       ;
    ing urged, that an upcast pit with a funnel will produce equal
    effects, and ata   smaller expense.
      If   the former objection be urged,   I   hope
                                                   it    will occur to the
    eoal- owner, that the investment    of  1000/. of extra  capital, toge
    ther with the weekly wages of two boys and the consumption of
    20 tons of small coal per week that would otherwise go to waste,
    or in the best situations be not worth more than 40y., are mat
    ters of comparative small importance and expense compared with
    the ruinous derangement which takes place throughout the whole
    of the work when an explosion occurs.
.    /if    the second objection which   I    have anticipated be .urged
                                                                      against

 sition to the powers of the steam-engine and air-pump,                  I hope it
will   be accompanied with satisfactory data to determine the ques
tion.     At any rate it may excite discussion, and lead to experi
ments on the best mode of rendering perfectly safe to humanity
and to the proprietors          at large a highly important branch of
our national wealth and comfort.                                               C.

        tary of' State for the Home Department, &c. &c.

                                                                        19, 1815.
                      HE Board of the National Vaceine Establish
ment has the honour to report to your lordship, that a greater
number of individuals has been vaccinated in the course of last
year than the preceding ; that several thousand more charges
of vaceine lymph* have been distributed to the public, whence
the destructive ravages of small-pox have been diminished.
     It appears from the bills of mortality of London, that the
deaths occasioned by small- pox have decreased in a larger pro
portion than one-fourth, six hundred and thirty-eight having
fallen vietims to that malady during the last year, eight hundred
and ninety-eight during the former.                Large indeed is this me
lancholy catalogue, which is attributable to the dissemination of
variolous matter by a few interested individuals, who, from sordid
 motives, continue the practice of inoculating with small-pox virus,
 and diffusing this fatal disease through the. metropolis-                     _
     With the    view  of  augmenting        the  benefits  of   this   establish.-
 ment, the Board has lately appointed a class of extraordinary
 vaccinators, in addition to the stationary surgeons of respecta
 bility, who have voluntarily stepped forward to contribute their
 assistance gratuitously, compose this class, from which it is in
 tended hereafter to elect the stationary vaccinators.
     Another class, denominated corresponding vaccinators, har
 also been established, from which a very material extension Uf
 the benefits to be derived from the Vaccine Institution h Con-
.fideutly expected.        Each person will in his own neighbourhood
 bfe a point, from which the practice will continually diverge, and
 through whom any communication of importance may at onfle
 be made to this Board.
     • At the different statioiis 4,68<? persont have been  vaccinated,  and 92^199
  charge* oflyrnph have been distributed.
                                                                                The

64         Report   of the National Vaccine Establishment.
    The stationary and extraordinary vaccinators must reside in
London, or the suburbs ; but the corresponding may live at any
distance, or in any part of the world.
    The official communications from the Medical Colleges of
Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Dublin, evincing their confidence in
vaccination, and the annihilation of small-pox in the settlements
of the Cape of Good I lope and of Ceylon, by its introduction, as
formerly reported, have been insufficient to convince some in
dividuals of the security against the infection of small-pox ; but
it is to be hoped that the strong additional facts hereafter stated
will produce the fullest conviction of its benefits in their minds.
    From the official documents transmitted by the Right Hon.
the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to this Board, re
 specting the effects of vaccination in the islands of Mauritius
 and Bourbon, it appears that the inhabitants have been secured
 against the visitation of one of the severest scourges incident to
 the human race, as the sequel shows.         In the year 1728, the
 small-pox swept oft0 nearly one-half of the population; in 17^6,
 about one-fourth; in 1771 and 1772, it occasioned a compara
 tively less, though very great mortality ; and in 1792 it destroyed
 one-third ; and of those who survived the disease, one-third
 lingered out a short and miserable existence, afflicted with dropsy,
 marasmus, consumption, &c.         It is worthy of remark, that in
 three times out of the four, the disease was introduced by slave
 ships. Let the contrast now he drawn between the introduction
 of variolous infection and vaccine inoculation.
     In 1802, vaccination was introduced from the British posses
 sions in India, but its general use was prevented by the preju
 dices of the people, and the lymph, after a short time, could not
 be procured.      In 180.>, it was re-introduced, and the French
 government, seeing the necessity of regulations, framed some ac
 cordingly; but vaccination was only partially adopted, for it did
 not exist in many parts of the island when the British took pos
 session of it.    In 1811, the small-pox re-appeared in the island,
 and about 220 persons became infected, of whom thirty died.
 The alarm excited by the progress of this disease, prompted his
 excellency Governor Farquhar to issue his mandate, compelling
-all the inhabitants to be immediately vaccinated; which energetic
 measure at once arrested the progress of small-pox.
     In 1813 an opportunity was offered of putting to the test the
 security of vaccination, by a slave (who came from the island of
 Madagascar, and was afflicted with the confluent form of small
 pox) having been landed and received into the hospital; manv
 slaves and other vaccinated persons were exposed to the infec
 tion, but no one became the subject of the disease.        .
     From the introduction of vaccination in 1802, to the 28th of
                                                             February

             Report  of the National  Vaccine Eslablishmenl .      C5
  February 1814, it is computed that 200,000 persons have been
  vaccinated ; and the medical practitioners unanimously declare,
  that no instance has occurred of small-pox being contracted
  after regular vaccination.
     In the island of Bourbon the calamitous effects of variolous
 disease, and the beneficial consequences of vaccination, though
 detailed in a more abridged form, as forcibly corroborate the
 utility of vaccine inoculation, from its having banished the small
 pox from that settlement.
    The National Vaccine Board cannot omit to direct your lord
 ship's attention    to the meritorious   conduct  and zealous exer
 tions of private   individuals, not of the medical profession, who
 have not only vaccinated many hundreds every year; but who
have studiously maintained a supply of lymph in their districts
for the perpetual renewal        of vaccination.      It has particu
larly noticed the ardent zeal of Mr. Ellis, of Rhos Farm, who
has vaccinated several thousands in North Wales, without a sin
gle failure ; and also of the late Rev. Mr. Holt, and the Rev.
Mr. Finch, two of the earliest friends to the practice ; who re
sided, the one in Buckinghamshire, the other in a populous part
of Lancashire, and who met with undeviating success ;— a suc
cess which puts to shame the negligent         practice of some be
longing to the medical profession.       For, strange as it may ap
pear, it is not the less true, that there are many places in the
united kingdom, where, though vaccination is professed, it is ia
effect never fairly practised.      Lymph, indeed, has been pro
cured from the National Establishment, but it would seem only
for present, and not prospective purposes ; as no pains have been
taken to preserve it by a succession of cases ; and that too, where
the population in many of the districts supplied, has exceeded
some thousands, and even in some of these where county hospi
tals are established.
    In many instances the Board has had reason to lament, that
throughout entire districts the lymph has been lost altogether ;
and when thus suffered to be lost, there must surely be just
grounds of suspicion that interested motives have actuated indi
viduals to throw serious impediments in the way of the general
adoption of vaccination.
    In confirmation of this conclusion, the Board adds the plain
 and unaffected narrative of a person who, humbly situated in life,
has in the true spirit of philanthropy been the instrument of dia-
            the benefits of vaccination to an extensive neighbourh
   ood, and of preserving a regular supply of lymph, with which
 Eensing
 many medical practitioners have been liberally furnished.

 the history of his practice, which from the purest motives of be

6S          Report   of the National Vaccine Establishment.
nevolence he commenced under circumstances not necessary to
be detailed, thus proceeds in his communication to the Board : —
*« Vaccine inoculation has
                                   acquired such a character for ten miles
round where I dwell, that the natural small-pox is not heard of.
In this village there is not one child which has not been vacci
nated, (excepting in two families,) so universal has the practice
become ; and it is remarked by the inhabitants of the village,
that the children are more numerous owing to their being vacci
 nated ; and among the children that I have vaccinated, I chal
 lenge all the country round to produce any instance in which the
 inoculation failed to preserve them from variolous contagion,
 notwithstanding their being exposed to lying in bed, eating and
 drinking with those infected with the small-pox.                   I am much
 surprised     when   I  hear  of  such  backwardness       in and  about Lon
 don to the performance of such a salutary benefit to the human
 race. If any one should speak against it in any village, or in the
 large parish of St. Ninians, he would expose himself to the con
 tempt of all the people."
     The National Vaccine Board has it in contemplation to enrol
 the names of such steady and exemplary friends, under the deno
 mination of Honorary Vaccinators, as they cannot with propriety
 be included in the other orders ; and it hopes to receive from this
  class a continuance of their valuable communications.                  Though
  it cannot be supposed that any stimulus is required to incite the
  active labours of such highly commendable persons, yet the Board
  cannot in justice silently pass over such zeal without giving some
  signal mark of its approbation.
      Notwithstanding the accumulated and accumulating proofs of
  the utility of vaccination, there is reason to apprehend that va
  riolous inoculation will still be persisted in, whereby the baneful
  effects of small-pox must be continually propagated.
      The Board has with regret to observe, that although the pu
  nishment of three months imprisonment was awarded against
  Sophia Vantandillo, for carrying her child whilst under the influ
  ence of small-pox through the public streets, (which infected
  many others, eight of whom died,) the unwary and uninformed
  are still enticed by the hand-bills of shameless empirics, to sub
  mit their children to variolous inoculation. It is however yet to
  be hoped, that the above sentence so recently passed by the
   Court of King's Bench, which the Board of the Vaccine Esta
   blishment has taken every method of promulgating, may produce
   considerable benefit.         But if inoculation of small-pox be per
  mitted, the promiscuous intercourse of the infected with society
   at large, ought to be as speedily as possible prevented, and a re
  ceptacle* established, to which the diseased should be immedi-

which most of the poor reside, must tend to concentrate conta
gion, to render it extremely virulentj and eventually to dissemi
nate this disease under its most malignant form.
    The Board selected Sophia Vantandillo as a proper example,
on account of the extent of the mischief occasioned by her mis
conduct ; and that this prosecution, followed by a lenient punish
ment, may prevent any further wilful exposure of inoculated per-'
sons, is its fervent wish.   It at the same time prosecuted Mr. Bur
net, who inoculated the child of Sophia Vantandillo, and who has
long circulated the most mischievous and offensive hand-bills, pf-
fering to inoculate persons with small-pox gratuitously, and stig
matizing vaccination as productiveof the most loathsome diseases.
    This practitioner, having suffered judgment to go by default/
has been recently sentenced by the Court of King's Bench to six'
months    imprisonment.
    The Board has a duty of the highest nature to perform ; —and'
that it is resolved to discharge faithfully and energetically.
    The Board has endeavoured to form a system, regular and
consistent in all its parts, conducing uniformly to one main end,
namely, the universal adoption of the practice introduced by the
immortal Jenner. It entertains the confident expectation that so
great a blessing will be no longer under-valued, and that the'la-
bours of the good and powerful will not be rendered impotent by
the ignorant and the interested.           It trusts that the wisdom of
Parliament will not be set at nought by the most unfeeling and
worthless of the medical profession, and a disease even more de
structive than the plague, allowed to be fostered by them with
impunity, and continually propagated among the unsuspecting
multitude of the united kingdom.
    The whole of the expenses incident to this establishment, for
 the year 1814, were defrayed by the vote of Parliament which
 passed last year ; but the Board regrets, that in consequence of
 the recent prosecutions and convictions of the persons mentioned
 in this Report, and the measures adopted for the more effectual
 extension of the practice of vaccination throughout the empire,
 an addition of five hundred pounds to the annual grant will be
 necessary.                         J. Latham,

     Dr. Spurzheim      has just published a second edition of his
 work on the Anatomy and Physiology of the Brain, with consi
 derable additions.       The science of the organology of the brain
 is rapidly advancing, and every month some new cases of corro
boration, or some new discovery, have engaged the Doctor's at
 tention. The medical gentlemen who have given their time to
 this subject have many of them become very zealous pupils, and
 on the whole the science is rapidly gaining ground in Great
 Britain.     Several Reviews have mentioned the work ; but no
-arguments, according to the opinion of the craniologists, have
yet been able to set aside the proofs of the truth of the theory.

                              AGRICULTURE.
 At     the Holkham sheep-shearing, held at the beginning of this
 month, Mr. Coke, of Norfolk, alluding to that destructive in
sect the wire-worm, observed, that as rooks devoured great
quantities of these insects, it was impolitic to wage indiscriminate
 war against these birds.
    The Earl of Albemarle then communicated the following
highly useful information :
    u I think I
                 may with confidence state, that oil-dust destroys
the wire-worm. — I ground my assertion on the successful result
of two experiments, one on turnips, the other on wheat. The
first was an old sainfoin layer for turnips, a small part of which
was sown with oil-dust, at the rate of half a ton to an acre, be
fore the last ploughing for turnips. — When they came up, there
was a perfect plant all over the field, but soon went off in every
part except where the dust was sown ; they continued to look
strong and healthy.         The portion which failed was ploughed and
sown again with turnips — again the wire-worm destroyed them.
 They were, for the third time, sown with coleworts, which shared
the same fate as the turnips — the dusted part remaining at this
time uninjured, and produced a fine crop.
    ". In order," continued the noble lord,       "  more fully to prove
that it was the oil-dust, and no incidental change of soil, which
thus preserved mv turnips, I must explain to ypu, that the dust
was not sown as the steches were drawn out, but, most fortunately
for the success of my experiment, diagonally.              This direction
was, in the first instance, purely accidental — I verily believe that
you might see exactly the path in which the seedsman walked.
~   The next was a piece of wheat, which had also partially been
sown with oil-dust.        In the spring the wire-worms attacked it ;
but on examining the roots, I found five wire-worms dead in one
piece of oil paste.     It sustained but little injury, produced eight
coombs per acre, and I have no reason to doubt was preserved
by the oil-dust."
                               oxalic acip.
    Although it is an unquestionable     fact that all concentrated acids
4re destructive of animal life if     taken   in any considerable quan
tity; yet they have not in general been denominated poisons,
owing, perhaps, to the vague application of this term.              Some
 ehemists have even ventured to deny their poisonous quality,
 notwithstanding     the destructive powers of prussic and other
 scids ; and Guyton Morveau has recently denied that the oxalic
                          '
                                   E3                                »«id

70                    Oxalic Acid. — Diamonds.
 acid can act as a poison.       The experiments, however, of        Mr.
 A. T. Thomson, " Medical Repository," remove all doubts on
 this head. A solution of ten grains of oxalic acid thrown into
 the stomach of a rabbit killed the animal in a few minutes; a
 drachm administered in like manner to a do«, killed him in ten
  minutes.     The appearances on dissection were a pulpy state into
  which the coats of the stomach were reduced.         This state is in
 geniously conjectured by Mr. Hume to arise from a decompo
  sition of the phosphate of lime contained in the coats of the
  stomach.     But however this may be, it appears undeniable that
  oxalic acid taken into the stomach acts as a virulent poison.
  Mr. Roystbn has related a plain case : " A woman took about
  four drachms of oxalic acid mistaking it for sulphate of magnesia.
  Excessive tormina shortly ensued, and in forty minutes after
  swallowing it she expiFed."       A mixture of chalk and water, if
  taken shortly after the oxalic acid, proves an antidote, by forming
  an oxalate of ,lime in the stomach.      The knowledge of this fact
  is much more important than may be generally supposed, as
  there is a number of persons in the habit of using a solution of
  oxalic acid regularly, supposing or alleging it to be a cooling
  beverage, an excellent remedy for the effects of wine or other
  stimulants,   and imagining that it improves their complexion,.
  and renders them proof against any contagion or infectious dis
  ease.    Now that it is proved to be a potent poison, perhaps
  they may discover that its greatest virtue is in tempting the hand
  of death before nature designs it.
      Oxalic acid is very frequently sold in the shops for citric acid ;
  and as if to sanction this deception, it is vulgarly called the " salt
  of lemons," although sorrel and sugar with nitrous acid are the
  chief articles used in its formation.      It crystallizes in slender
  four-sided rhomboidal prisms, bevilled at each extremity; the
  crystals are white, of an agreeable sour or tartish taste, and per
  manent in the air or slightly efflorescent.     The crystals of citric
  acid are not so white, of a sharp acid taste, almost caustic, and
  permanent in the air, although inclining rather to deliquesce than
  effloresce.   The crystals are rhomboidal prisms acuminated by
  four planes, and much more soluble in water than those of oxalic
  acid, boiling water dissolving double its weight of citric acid and
  only its own weight of oxalic.
                               DIAMONDS.
      At the third annual course of lectures of the Birmingham
  Philosophical Society which closed a short time since, a very
  curious description and estimate of diamonds known to be in
  existence, were given by Mr. Thonson.        The number of known
  diamonds of 36 carats and upwards, he stated to be no more
.   . ;                                                             than

                        Diamonds. — Chemistry.                       71
 than 19, two only of which were in England, the Piggott dia
 mond weighing 45 carats, and worth 16,200/. and one in the
 possession of the Hornsby family of 36 carats, worth 8000/.
 Holland has but one, which weighs 36 carats, and is valued at
 10,363/.; its form is conical, and it was for some time in the
possession of Messrs. Rundell and Bridge, of London. — France
 has two ; the largest was bought by the Duke of Orleans during
 his Regency, and thus called the Regency Diamond ; its weight
is 166| carats, and value 149,038/. — Germany has one weighing
 )39| carats, and worth 155,682/. — Russia is rich in these gems;
its largest is that of the Sceptre, which is said to weigh 770 ca
rats.    If this be true, it must be worth, according to the general
mode of estimating them, the enormous sum of 4,854,728/.-—
The history of this diamond is rather curious.         For a long time
it formed the eye of an East Indian Idol, from which post it was
removed by a European soldier.         From him it passed through
several hands, and was finally sold to the Empress Catherine for
90,000/. a handsome annuity, and a patent of nobility. — Russia
has several others, one of which is estimated at 369,800/. — The
Great Mogul has one of a rose colour, and valued at 622,728/.
The two principal ones belonging to Persia are called in the
hyperbolical language of the East " The Mountain of Splendour,"
jic. and " the Sea of Glory." one is worth 145,800/. and the
other 34,848/. — The Portuguese Royal Family have two, one of
which is still uncut; and, if we may credit the Portuguese ac
counts, is the largest ever found: it is said to weigh 1680 carats:
and supposing it to lose half its weight in cutting, it would be
worth 5,644,800/. upwards of a million more than the Sceptre
Diamond of Russia.         There is a small part broken off, which
was done by the man who found it ; who, ignorant what stone it
was, struck it with a hammer upon an anvil.         It was found at the
Brazils. It must not be concealed that some persons conversant
in these things doubt the existence of this stone.        According to
the model exhibited, it is somewhat like the shape and size of
an ostrich's egg.      The other diamond in the possession of the
 House of Braganza is worth 3,698,000/.
    M. Van Mons, of Brussels, observes in a letter recently Ter
cel ved from    him, addressed to the Editor of this Journal : — " My
friend Brugnatelli has ascertained that ice is electrified positively
while it is scraped : he always found it a very good conductor,
whereas water exempt from salts, or when distilled and very
pare, is almost a non-conductor.         Electricity is checked in bo
 dies in which it finds hydrogen to displace or oxygen to take up ;
 and the ice which, by the abstraction of caloric, has acquired a
 new excess of oxygen, is not in this situation.        M- Brugnatelli
                                   E 4                              has

72                          Chemistry.
 has also made several experiments, in the hope of awakening in
ice an electro-motive power, by associating it with the metals
 and other bodies of a nature opposite to its own, but without suc
cess. He thinks that the qualities of ice strongly resemble those
 of sulphur.
     "M. Zamboni has modified the dry pile so as to obtain from
it violent shocks and strong sparks. I shall send you by and by
a description and drawing of his improved apparatus.
     " In Germany some chemists have succeeded in uniting borax
with carbon, by treating both bodies in a platina crucible.        A
strong crackling and swelling up was observed',      and a borure  of
carbon was obtained, shining and striated. The borax had in fact
a strong resemblance to the carbon ; it becume fixed in the fire,
it had the same colour, was insoluble in the alkalies, refused to
combine with the oxygenated acids, it was incombustible at a
black heat, it had an evident affinity for a single metal, and a
metal a bad conductor of caloric, and susceptible of becoming of
a bright red before melting, having a great intensity of oxida
tion ; besides its oxide, of a feeble intensity, having scarcely the
physical characters of acidity, forming alkalescent salts, uniting
itself with dry fluoric acid, as the carbonic acid unites with the
dry muriatic acid, &c. : the combination between borax and car
bon completes this parallel of their properties, and this union
may be compared to the analogies between sulphur and phos
phorus, and between iodine and chlorine.         With respect to the
latter combination (that between iodine and chlorine) we have
succeeded, by a strong and rapid heat, in extricating oxygen
from it ; after which it sustains a red heat without being decom
posed.    This fact is very curious and important, on account of
the great number of new bodies to which the double hyperoxy-
genated acid gives birth."
     M. Vauquelin,  in a recent number of the Anwile. de Cfiimie,
thus relates  an accident which happened on mixing the chlorine
of barytes with acetate : " I had purposed preparing a great
quantity of chloric acid in order to form combinations and study
their properties.     With this view I followed the process of M.
Chenevix, which consists in making the chlorine of barytes act
on the phosphate of silver : but this action being very slow, I
made use of a small quantity of acetic acid to accelerate     it, as
recommended         M. Chenevix.
                    by              The operation then took place
with the greatest facility, particularly when   a   slight heat was
applied.
   " When had carefully separated the chlorine of barytes from
            I
the chlorate,   1 evaporated the latter to dryness;  and after hav-
ing redissolved     itin water,
                             I    set asidea  part of the solution,
                                                                and

                        French Prize Memoirs.                        73
and    decomposed the other by sulphuric acid : I obtained the
chloric acid,                 J
                with which made many combinations, the proper
 ties of which I intend to describe on a future occasion.
     " I evaporated and crystallized the portion of chlorate of ba-
rytes which I had kept in reserve.       This being done, I dried a
certain portion of it in order to inspect the water of crystalliza
tion.    I put two grammes of the latter into a platina crucible,
which I exposed to the fire in order to determine the loss which
this salt should undergo on being decomposed, which would have
given me the quantity of oxygen, at least in an approximative
manner, for I already knew the barytes.         But shortly after this
salt was exposed to the fire, a detonation took place which re
sembled a musket-shot at least.        The furnace was broken ; the
platina crucible, although very thick, was rent in several places ;
the bottom, which was flat, was driven in like a cone ; and the lid
was forced against the chimney, to which it stuck, assuming the
same form.
    " Although the circumstance astonished me at first, yet when
I reflected on the way in which chlorate of barytes thus prepared
acts on burning coal?, my surprise was lessened. In fact, it does
not fuse like the chlorate of potash ; it detonates rapidly and with
great noise, even upon the parts of the charcoal where no more
 sign of combustion is observed.
     " When reflecting on the cause of this detonation, it occurred to
me at first that it consisted in a rapid disengagement of oxygen ;
but chlorate of potash, prepared directly with my chloric acid,
having presented the same phaenomenon, whilst that prepared by
ihe common process does not present         it,  we must seek for     it
elsewhere  ;  and   I soon found that  itwas to the acetate of barytes
that  it ought to have been attributed.
    " We must therefore admit that the acetic acid employed to
expedite the operation does not confine itself to dissolving the
phosphate of silver, as generally supposed      :     also decomposes
                                                    it it
a   part of the chlorate of barytes, from which      should seem that
it  drives off the acid or decomposes it.
    " From what have said, appears that the acetic acid ought
                    I             it
not to be employed for preparing the chloric acid         for, indepen
                                                            ;
dent of the troublesome accidents which might result, the acid
obtained   is not fine, any more than the combinations made with it.
     " The process of Mr. Chenevix being very tedious when vin
 egar is  not employed,   I am endeavouring to find one more expe
 ditious, and   Iexpect to succeed."
  The French Class of Physical and Mathematical Sciences has
proposed the following as the subject of a prize memoir viz. To ;
determine, 1st. The march   of the mercury thermometer, at least
                                                                    from

vacuo ; 3d. The laws of cooling in the air, hydrogen gas and
carbonic acid gas, at different degrees of temperature and for
different states of rarefaction.
    The prize will be a gold medal 3000 francs in value.
    Another medal, of the same value, is offered for the solution of
the following phaenomenon :
    " Fruits acquire new properties in attaining maturity, even
when they are taken from the tree : they afterwards pass spee
dily into another state, and yet we are still unacquainted with the
changes in their composition, and the causes which produce them."
    The Class is desirous of ascertaining, therefore, " the chemi
cal changes which fruits undergo during their ripening and be
yond that term. With this view, it will be necessary to examine
with care the influence of the atmosphere surrounding the fruits,
and the alterations which they receive from it.       The observa
tions may be confined to some fruits of different species, providing
the consequences drawn be sufficiently general."
    The papers on the above subjects must be given in before the
17th of October 1816, and the prizes will be awarded in Janu
ary 1817.

   Extract of a Letter from the Cape of Good Hope, dated the
                          26/ h of April last.
    u I have the satisfaction of announcing to
                                                 you the safe return
to this place of that very extraordinary young man, Mr. William
Burchell, after an absence of more than six years, traversing
and exploring the extreme parts of South Africa.        The dangers
and privations he has thus voluntarily endured to gratify his
thirst after knowledge, far surpass all I have ever met with
in the history of other travellers for similar purposes.    The joy
ful and interesting reception he met with from his old friends
and acquaintances at the Cape, who went out to meet him, and
who had several times given him up as lost, was most gratifying
 to his feelings, and must also afford great consolation to his re
 latives and friends in England. He has brought home with him an
immense collection of the natural productions of that heretofore
unexplored country, particularly birds ; and as there are in an
eminent degree combined in this man the philosopher, the bo
tanist, the artist, and the scholar, the public may fairly calculate
upon receiving, on his return, information of the most valuable
and interesting description.       I understand he is preparing' to
sail with the first ship ; he may therefore be expected in Eng
land about the latter end of August."

  Meteorological        Observations    made at       Clapton, in Hackney,
                     from June 27 to July 12, 1815*
      June 27. — Fine clear day; cumuli and some cirrus above
  them; towards afternoon the cuiauli increased and condensed,
  but the night was fair, with haziness.              There was a soft ap
  pearance     in the   western    horizon  occasioned      by the disposition.
  of the clouds, and by their edges being softened down in ap
  pearance by the interposed mist.              I noticed this morning a
  whirlwind which carried up much dust in the Leehridge road.
      June 28. — Fair hot day. Thermometer 73° at midday.—
  Cumuli form and rapidly evaporate again.                  Some features of
  c'trronti alns in the afternoon.         Wind southerly.        The evening
  was beautiful ; a pale golden colour         above    the  set sun, and with
  a clear greenish blue to the N. and a line pink blush above.
      June 20. — More cloud in elevated masses.              The day was fair
  and warm, and the evening somewhat cooler.                  A fine clear sun
  set.  .- The wind veering eastward with dry airf.
      June 30. — Early the sky was clouded ; but a fine warm day
  with cumuli succeeded.           The evening sunset presented a clear
  yellowish-golden colour, with a pinkish blush above it. Wind
  S and SE.       A light gale with cloudiness came up suddenly at
  about midnight.
      July 1. — Fair day: cumuli, &c. Towards evening copper-
  coloured refractions in cumulostratus            breaking up ; some lighc

   July 2. — There was a cool NE wind, and cloudy sky in the
morning ; the edges of the clouds in general were not well de
fined* ; the day became warmer ; in the evening cumulus, rocky
appearance, &c. ; features of cumulus, and large low cirri con
densing with copper-coloured and afterwards crimson colours in
their under parts.   The colour of the western horizon pale yel

   July 3. — Cool easterly wind, and cloudiness early ; sun at in
tervals through the day.    The clouds were ill-defined in their
edges in general.   Clear cool night. At midnight Thermometer
45°.    Barometer30-ll.
    July 4. — A great deal of cumulos trains obscured the sky ;
very slight nimbification took place about two o'clock.       The
wind was gentle, and the weathercock indicated a southern di
rection.     The quantity of cloud continued; some lofty and
large cirrocumulus in the evening.    Thermometer at midday 63° ,
at 1 1 P.M. 54°.    Barometer 30-12.
    July 5. — Clear morning; cumuli formed, and in the after
noon obscured the sky almost.      Fair evening, with lofty clouds
with the cirrocumulative arrangement.       Thermometer midday
74°, at 11 P.M. 53*.       Barometer 30-18. Wind gentle and
northerly.
   July 6. —The day was fair and warm, but there were light
irregular gales from the north and east with cumuli below, and
much cirrus, whose fibres were assuming horizontality, above in
a higher air ; forms of cirrocumulus too occasionally broke out.
Towards evening the subsidence everywhere of the fibres of cirrus
into the denser and more horizontal cirrosiratus foreboded the
gentle rain which came down at night.       At 11 P.M. while
raining. Thermometer 54°. Barometer 30-04.
     I
   * am now convinced by repeated observation, that nervous and sus
ceptible persons who are much influenced in their feelings by the atmo
sphere, are in general worse when the clouds are characterized by an inde
finite and contused margin. There are probably many varieties in the!
electric state of the air (not discoverable by our present instruments) which
act on the constitutions of different individuals, and produce irritation ;
and the periodicity noticed in many disorders by physicians of old, and the
periodical affection of the health of persons in general noticed by Dr.
Spurzheiin, must, I   think, be referred to the atmospheric electricity." But
we cannot always detect even in the clouds marks of its unwholesome
states.   There is,  however, usually
                                    a    very uncomfortable feeling when the
clouds have ill-defined edges, their circumscriptions not bein» distinctly
marked, but when they arc confused with the surrounding atmosphere.

    July 7. —A showery tendency appeared in the atmosphere by
the disposition of the clouds, with a            strong northerly wind to
wards evening ; night cool and fair.
    July 8. — N wind early, then westerly.                Cumuli under a
higher     veil  of   cloud,  which   showed    now   and  then features of
cirrocumulative         cirrostratus ; the latter cloud also in bars, &c.
 Some       drops of inosculation towards evening.            At 11 P.M.
Thermometer 55°, with a clouded sky.
     July 9. — This morning I witnessed a phaenomenon, of which
 (though not uncommon) I shall relate the particulars, as it serves
to point out the nature and causes of some atmospheric changes.
Early abundance of filiform cirri were strewed aloft, and cumuli
formed in a lower region ; by and by the cirri disappearing, the
cumulus was changed for cumulostralus ; and the progressive
conversion of the former into the denser and upward-spreading
features of the latter cloud, seemed to clear the upper air of the
cirrus.       The cumulostralus when formed, preserved the ten
dency to have its prominences curl inward, which the previous
iumuli had. Afterwards much cloud obscured the sky.
    July 10. — Fair warm day, with cumuli, &c. Remarkably fine
 evening, almost cloudless.
     July 1 1 . — Fair hot day, with cumulus ; the cirrus appeared
 toward evening.          The night was damp, and there was a haziness
in the horizon at sunset.            About 1 1 at night, I noticed the
electricity     of the  blades  of grass on a grass-plot behind the house.
 It appeared as a whitish and very faint and almost momentary
augmentation of light on certain parts, and now and then a
mint scintillation.          I have noticed this phaenomenon before on
similar fair damp summer evenings, after hot days.                  Thermo
meter in the day 75°, at midnight 54°.                   Barometer 3O20.
 Wind south-westerly.
     July 12. — Hot day, light cirrocumulative cirrostratus was the
 first cloud to appear to-day ; cumulus prevailed during day, but
 did not abound.           Fine clear sky in evening, with few cirri, and
 gentle gales      from   SVV.    Thermometer 78° and 58°.          By night
  I saw a very minute falling star*.          .

 XX}. Comparative Anatomy ; or a slight Attempt to draw up
   a Comparison between Animal and Vegetable Life.     By
         Mrs. Agnes Ibbetson.
                            To      Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,—       A fter having dissected most parts of vegetables, shown
  their different powers, and endeavoured as far as able to inquire
  into and explain the various uses to which each different part is
  applied, it struck me that it was now time to draw up some
  thing of a comparison between animal and vegetable life. I
  have often during the course of this work lamented the injury
  done to the anatomy of botany, from comparisons drawn only
  from human anatomy : because a surgeon would be but too apt
  to add many more powers than really exist in the vegetable,
  unless he .had very exactly compared and studied the two dis
  sections together.       Rut as a perfect assistance may be procured
  in the description of the human body, that, joined to a thorough
  knowledge of the vegetable, would not, I think, be liable to the
. same
          objection.     I shall, however, try it : and if I should make
  any mistake, it will be pardoned in one who can claim but very
  imperfect knowledge in human anatomy, and who will (but in a
  very few cases) attempt (in animal anatomy) to borrow from her
  own dissections.
       In reading books of anatomy, and viewing the dissections of
  animal life, when contrasted with a vegetable being, it is impos
  sible not to be struck with the studied care and elaborate pains
  seemingly exhausted in forming the first, and the clearness of
  invention and simplicity of formation observed in the second. To
  display this, I shall first give a slight sketch of the human figure,
  contrasting     it,as I  proceed, with  a  more finished picture of the
  vegetable frame       touching most lightly on those parts which ad
                        ;
  mit not of being compared with plants, but dwelling as strongly
  and clearly as possible on those features ivhich do, or are sup
  posed to, admit of some resemblance to the human structure.
   In viewing the figure of     a   man and of     atree,  it   is
                                                               hardly pos
  sible to conceive two things more completely dissimilar            ;and in
   beholding   the  skeleton  of  each, they would    appear too much    un
   like to be compared, not seeming at           first view to offer any of
                                                  a
   those similitudes which are necessary in such cases.
       But though no general resemblance can be discovered, yet           a
   sort of comparison may be drawn up, perhaps advantageous to
   both,- as more clearly impressing on the mind the- beautiful          di
   versity to be found in two beings, both possessed of            different
                                                                     a
    kind of existence   ;  showing also  a few instances in which there
    i? some resemblance; fixing the similitude which does or docs not

82             Comparative    Anatomy ; or an Attempt at
 exist ; but which in contemplation must continually remind us,
 that the same great and benevolent Being formed and created
 both.
      To give some idea, though an imperfect one, of the nature of
 the two different beings to be compared, " the human form and
 vegetable," it is first necessary to fix on those parts which can
 in any measure be assimilated to each other.               To the brain,
 spinal    medulla,    and   heart of  an animal,  'we  can  only with jus
  tice contrast the line of life of a tree. But how different! how
 inferior ! The spiral wire        is, however,   amore faithful image of
 the muscle indeed, as the plant
               :                         isapparently a  mechanical being,
 we might expect to find the strongest similitude in these parts;
 and as the muscle       isin both the only part which seems to possess
a    self-existing   motion,   we can be in no danger of mistaking in the
 vegetable     the  wrong situation, since the spiral         the only part
                                                               is
 which    is vis insita.      The wood and the bones also have some
-curious analogies.        The blood, with the bark, juice, and sap, may
  be compared.        The oil of the muscles and spiral wire are the
 same.      The womb and seed-vessel are something alike. The
 stomach, the place of digestion         ; the liver, the secreter of bile;
 the kidneys, the bladder,       —  all belong to a being that digests               ;
 which the plant does not. The skin and the upper cuticle have
 no resemblance whatever.           The plant has no nerves; nor are the
 muscles at all attached to the line of life, or brain of the plant.
 Both beings have lymphatics, both have glands, but the vegetable
is    different from the animal gland         ;since the vegetable has no
 secretions from the blood, but receives the juices of this kind all
 pure from the hairs. Does not every part of this selection
 prove the vegetable to be         a   mere mechanical agent?         great a
 and bold line, drawn         by   the Almighty hand to diversify and
 beautify creation, and fill up the link which would otherwise T>e
 wanting between the organized and unorganized matters                  Let I
 us then descend to the minutiae of the existing difference.
     First then (to borrow Hunter's words and plan), we must form
 a human being.         The mind (the immaterial agent) must be pro
 vided with    a   place of immediate residence, which shall have all
 the requisites for the union of spirit and body: accordingly she                    is
 provided with a brain, where she dwells as governor and super-
 jntendant of the whole fabric. In the next place, as she                 to    is
 hold a    correspondence with all the material beings around her,
 she must be supplied with organs fitted to receive the different
 kinds of impressions which they will make:               in
                                                           fact, therefore,
 we see that she    is   provided with the organs of sense       the eye
                                                                    ;                io
 see, &c. &c., Further, she must be furnished with other organs
 between herself in the brain and those organs of sense            .and she
                                                                        ;
 must have other organs between herself ia the brain and
                                                                      evert/
                                                                                other

 other  part of the body, fit ted to convey her commands and in
 fluence over     the whole.       For both these purposes, nerves are
 adopted ; they convey all the sensations to the mind, and give
 notice of all suffering.     It is evident, therefore, that all sensations
 arise   from the impression of some active substance on some
 nerve   of the human body ; and that the same is represented to
 the mind by the means of the nerves connected with the brain :
 every nerve, therefore, that is irritated produces a sense of pain';
 and if certain parts of the brain are compressed, from which
particular nerves arise, then those senses are lost which depend
 on those nerves.         But in the injuries of the spinal medulla
 (which    is a continuation    of the brain down the vertebrae of the
 back) this is still more evident; for those parts which receive
their nerves arising from the place injured m the medulla, are
either convulsed if that be irritated, or rendered paralytic if
that be compressed (and if the greater part of the brain suffers,
the whole body loses its power of motion).              These things con
sidered, there seems to be no doubt that the cause of all sensibi
lity arises from the nerves being connected with the brain or
spinal medulla ; and that all voluntary motion equally arises
from the connexion of the nerves with the muscles, thus convey
ing its orders to and from the brain. Therefore it cannot re
side in the nerves themselves ; because otherwise the moving
 cause would continue to act after being separated from the brain,
nor would it be increased by its irritation.
    Of all this important and admirable formation of the human
body, what part does the vegetable possess ? Scarcely any that
can deserve to be assimilated to so wonderful and marvellous a
 structure of senses and feelings; though it has certainly great
beauty, not only from its simplicity, but arising also from the fit
ness of its form, so admirably adapted to its situation in the
grand scale of beings; but without volition, without sensibility,
even without senses.         The line of life can only be said to be the
brain, spinal medulla, and heart to the plant, to stand for all
three, though it resembles the heart only as the first visible life,
and the brain alone as the chief souree of existence, and the
spinal medulla as passing like the line of life through the body.
But how inferior an image of all ! It has not the action of the
heart, having neither arteries nor blood to circulate ; nor the brain,
having no nerves.         I have entered more minutely into this than
I intended, in order to impress on my readers a conviction I feel
jiayself, that, thus formed, there can be no volition in plants.
     To begin then with the description of the line of life (the only
part that can be compared to the brain and spine of an animal).
 The line is formed of' a matter firmer than the bark, not so hard
 as, the wood,     generally of a white colour, but sometimes green,
                                    F 2                          sometimes

    84             Comparative   Anatomy; or an Attempt at
    sometimes yellow, always Hack when dead.           When a vegetable is .
    really killed, this line is the first part to die: — thus, when struck
    with lightning or a hard frost, in a moment this line turns black,
    and can never again be revived, though the bark and leaves may
    for a time retain their verdure ; as, like the hair and nails of an
    animal, they possess but little life. The line of life consists of
    three or four rows of cylinders hollow in the middle, and within
     them are generally found the juices of the nectary; but this mixture
    formed in the middle root, seldom, I believe, flows up the vessels
    till after the flower haspassed up them : about the end of February
     the flower (formed in the root) enters these vessels, which en
     large for the purpose, and run up them, till they arrive at the
     buds, which were empty till then, having only their scales (pre
    pared some time bef ore), and smeared with an oil which protects
     the interior from all danger.      The embryo then quits the vessels,
     and enters those buds which are properly their cradles in the
     bark, situated in the axillae of the leaves. The vessels, after this
     service done, are restored to their usual size, and remain all the
     rest of the year unaltered, still conveying the nectareous jui&es.
     It is only three weeks of the year that this phaenomenon can be
     seen; it appears in every plant nearly a month before the
     flowering season.      With respect to life, this line more resembles
     the heart than brain of a human being ; as it is evidently the
    flrsf place which exhibits life: and though it does not show it by
     motion, having neither arteiies nor blood in this part, yet it is
     this line which gives life to the bud, to the seed, and to the flower.
         There is a curious similitude between the animal and vegeta
     ble that should be displayed here, as belonging to this part prin
     cipally. I have shown that the brain and spinal medulla are the
     sources of life in the animal, as the line of life is to the vegetable.
      I have also mentioned that the muscle and spiral wire are the
     sources of involuntary motion to both.          Now if they are each
     struck with a quick death, that is not lightning, the irritability:
     in the muscle will remain in both objects for a time after death ;
     but the animal struck with lightning or the plague, and the
     vegetable with lightning or a hard frost, will directly lose that
     irritability, and immedi te decomposition will come on ; each
     body will grow soft, pappy, and watery, putrefaction will sud
     denly succeed ; nay, this is often the case in both even before
     death.     Many have supposed that there might be some volition
     in plants. But how can that be? What is the cause of will in
     the human frame ? It is alone supported by the connexion of
     the nerve with the brain ; and in motion, that nerve being also
     fixed on the muscle, by its immedate action proves its obedience
     to orders sent it from that superior power : but there is no
,   ;wrve in the vegetable; nor does the muscle      (if   it could be sub^
l            :-.
                                        '   .                    stituted)

 with it.   How then can     will be announced or executed?
    There can therefore      be  no volition in plants, and they can
 only be apiece of living mechanism.        No person who has seen
 and dissected a plant killed by electricity, can doubt which is
 the line of life, since this line is directly marked from the root
 to every fibre, and turned completely black in a moment.
    I shall now turn to the animal and vegetable muscle.             And
 here the strongest similitude is to be discovered ; since it is the
 only part that in both beings can bo said to move by involuntary
 motion or vis insita.    It is well known that in the human body
 there are three sorts of motion ; the voluntary,      the involuntary,
 and the mixed : but the firsts two will serve our purpose here.
 The first is paused by the will, enforced by the nerve, and ex
 ecuted by the muscle; but the last is spontaneous, proceeds from
 the muscle alone, the cause unknown.           It remains often in the
 muscle after death, and, after it is divided from the brain, even
exercises its full force in this situation.         The human muscle
forms part of the flesh ; it consists of two parts, the wide (which
alone is active), and the thin shining extremity called the ten
don.     The only purpose of the last is to fix the muscle to the
moveable bones, which it does with a force not to be conceived
but by feeling it.    They are thus fastened in a concentrated man
ner, in which a greater power is permitted to act, as labours are
assisted by ropes in moving weighty bodies ; each muscle con
tracts both ends towards the centre, which serving as a fixed
point, draws the bones with it.       The wide part of the muscle is
the moving part, and is most curiously formed.        The muscles differ
in the number of their cases, some animal muscles have two,
or even three ; but the vegetable never hit one.          In the human
muscle a number of long, soft, fleshy fibres are seen inclosing
many bundles of hair-like figures, which are the nerves, and
which split ivithout end.       They appear to me to pass through
every part of the muscle, case and all; when the muscle is quite
fresh, they seem to move with light and moisture if suddenly
applied.     But 1 am not sure of this, having but once been able
to get them fresh enough for this examination.          It is difficult to
discover how solid the nerves are, since they contract at the end
the moment they are cut, and with such instantaneous effect,
that though I have divided them with the microscope at my eye,
 I could not catch a view up the pipe. There is no part of the
body which may be properly called fleshy (and which is in
truth the muscle) which is not penetrated in every direction by
 nervous fibres; their sensibility pervades the whole muscular sub
 stance, even its smallest portions ; and though they appear not to
 move themselves, yet thev are supposed to be by some means
                                   F3         ,                        the

85            Comparative Anatomy ; or an Attempt at
the cause of all voluntary motion to the muscles.        Cuvier think*
that they are the cause of all motion, both voluntary and in
voluntary; but that certainly cannot be, since the muscles of a
plant have the same vis insita, without possessing any verves.'
But there may undoubtedly be a sort of vaoour, which may pass
through the nerves from the brain, and cause a mo^t powerful
effect, but still be entirely separate from that vis insita which is
jo peculiar to the muscles, that no one who has seen it act both
in the human body and vegetables can confound it with any
other sort of motion.      The human muscle is a bundle of vessels:
the oil lubricates them, that they may not be hurt by constant
 friction : and this is exactly the case also with the vegetable ; but
the cases of both muscles are even more wonderful than the hair
like fibril they each contain . The human case appears to be formed
 oftwosortsof vessels; the fibril already described (which also enters
into the formation of the case, and runs longitudinally in it),
 and another sort of vessel which forms a line and space, and
passes across the muscle, and gives such a beautiful shining lucid
 appearance to the muscle case, and by its help draws up both
vessels.     The crossing vessels are alternately filled with a white
 oily matter, and the spaces between (being perfectly empty) by
the help of the nerve which gathers up longitudinally, the cross
 vessels are drawn into ribs one above and one below, which run
 ning in a forked manner produce that lucid appearance admired
 by surgeons.     When a piece of the muscle case is drawn out,
 and left to dry, it becomes clear and horny; and if when in this
 state it is bent to and fro very of ten, the place swells vp, and
 appears of a blueish milky colour, which I supposed to be caused
                           f
 by the oil given out rom the cross vessels.           The nerves also
  (which pass    through   the  muscles)  are with  this  management
  broken -and dispersed out of their cases; and it is then they are
 seen running in an undulating manner through the oily com
 pound,; wh'ch, now the vessels are destroyed, retain only a matter
 much resembling the impervious skin of the vegetable, only a
  more oily composition.       The vegetable muscle-case, like the
  human, has also the fibril muscle in it : it is formed of straight
  yessels, replete with oil ; but often so brittle they will not bear
  to be bent. These vessels are at some distance from each other,
  and laced up by the spiral wire.       Though the figure of each
  case does not possess a very strong resemblance, yet their effects
  are the same ; they have both the moveable fibrils within, the
  oil to lubricate, the case to protect the white oily vessels also;
  po point is wanting to prove that they are intended to produce
  the same effect, though perhaps set in motion by a different
  cause.    There can be no doubt that light and moisture are the

dienee      when excited ly those powers speaks for itself.                But
what is the human cause I leave to better heads than my own.
The involuntary motion of the human muscle seems always to
take place with a jerk or by impulses.               This is exactly the ca:e
with the vegetable, nor can they either move again till the re
laxation of the muscle has again taken place.                 It would be cu
rious to ascertain whether the measure is as exact in both as in
 the vegetable* .       In the plant there are two impulses, a long
and short one; the latter, half the length of the former ; the first
from ball to ball, the second from knot to knot.                   Both these
 measures are seen in the Mimosa sensitiva ; when the whole
 leaflet drops, the spiral is moved from ball to ball; but when it
 is a
        leaf only, then the spiral moves from knot to knot. When
 the stamens rub together to throw their dust on the pistil in the
 mosses, then it is a single impulse ; and when a leaf is moved it
js the same ; and the moisture it occasions undoes the spiral, and
 prepares it for a new contraction ; and so delicate and sensible
 is it to each increasing light or decreasing moisture, that each
 minute almost brings its variation; certainly each passing cloud
 over the sun, its change.           A few words, however, I must add on
the unknown cause of the muscular motion. The human muscle
lying so near the outward skin, (a cuticle which though doubled,
 nay trebled, is so pierced with pores which must admit much
 light and moisture,) would seem to suggest some canse for its
 motion, of the same nature as the vegetable, did not the peculiar
 sort of cross action in the muscle-cases seem to suggest a dif
 ference : and yet there is one circumstance which is so exactly
 contrived respecting the nerves, as it is in the vegetable in the
 muscles,      as to carry some impression with it: " The sense of
 touch is supposed to arise from the nervous extremities of the
 papillce being more numerous, or covered with a thicker or a
  thinner skin in some pkees than in others, and thus bestowing a
 grosser or a finer degree of feeling to the different parts.              Now
  this is exactly the case with the muscles : they increase their ir
  ritability in proportion to their advancement to the outward cu
  ticle, and as they become more sensible of the effects of the at
  mosphere.            -. . . .
      In all trees and shrubs whose          branches live through the win-,
  ter, and are therefore exposed to severe changes, the muscles are
  concealed within the wood : but in other plants (rising each year
   from the earth) they are discovered next the alburnum vessels 5
   and in all very sensitiue plants the outward cylinders of the rind
   are few    in number and very thin, and the more irritable the
   muscle the     thinner they are, Now there is some analogy here,
      *
         But in the human?   J  believe, it depends on the length of the muscle.

   '
     I shall now turn to the bone of the animal and wood of the
vegetable, which may from some curious particulars be com
pared together.      The first has a skeleton or system of bones
 which gives firmness and shape to the fabric, keeps the soft parts
in their places, affords fixed points to the organs of motion, and
gives them their proper direction, and protects some of the most
 tender parts from external injury.       To connect the bones to
gether,    there are ligaments   ; and to  afford smooth surfaces for
 them to play easily      on one another, their extremities are fur
 nished with cartilages or gristle.     The bones consist of an in
 terior, which is a species of honeycomb, and an exterior surface,
 which has many layers formed in a particular manner ; the last
 if cut with a very sharp knife, and very thin, appears composed
 of many meandering vessels Jilltd with atoms, which seem to be
 rather solid, from the clear spaces they show between them ;
 while the honeycomb parts are plates, thick in the middle and
 meeting in their thin edga.       This is also the same as the for
 mation of the large bones of the skull, which increase also to
 wards their centres ; but the most extraordinary        part of the
 wood is, that the foundation exactly resembles the thin surface
 of the bone, and is really composed of diminutive vessels filled
 with atoms : but this is only to be seen in both when excessively
 magnified, then they exactly resemble each other.       But the sy
 stem of wood, though it gives firmness to the fabric, yet obeys
 most strictly the laws of the line of life in its shape : it pre^
 serves, however, this important part from injury, but is within
 every other soft ingredient, and therefore cannot defend it.
     In trees and shrubs it serves as some support to the muscle,
 but in annuals and herbaceous plants the muscle changes its
place, and is at the external part of the wood.         It cannot be
Said to afford a fixed point for the organs of motion; for it is the
gristle which does this, which forms the balls round which the
 spiral winds itself, and which covers the ends of the wood in
 such a manner as to enable them to slip over or into each other,
 like a cup and ball. I never saw the knee or elbow of a human
 skeleton that it did not remind me of a Galium, Selene, or some
 of the stems of those plants which swell at the joint.         It is a
 sort of gristle which serves this purpose and sheathes the wood,
 a kind of thick matter, which performs, in its solid or liquid
 state, many important functions in the vegetable ceconomy, and
 makes a part, I doubt not, of that resinous compound Dr. Thom
 son discovered in the wood.
     But how curious it would be to possess and be able to exa
 mine that liquid which performs that extraordinary office of
                                                             clearing:

      a Comparison        between   Animal and Vegetable Life.            89
clearing the way through the hard wood for the buds ; pro
bably it might serve as a good comparison to the gastric juice;
for great must be its dissolving powers.    When the bud is first
formed on the line of life in the root, and runs up to that part
from which it is to start and make its way to the bark, the
wood opens it a passage; and this is apparently done, even through
iron wood, by a liquid which no sooner touches the fibres, than
they divide and bend, and thus make a sort of covered way for
the bud.     That the bud passes from the interior no one can, I
think, deny, who examines a tree after it has been barked: at
every time of the year, but particularly in the autumn, a quantity
of buds may be seen running from the line of life, to fix them
selves in the bark.    This is merely the embryo of the bud, or
empty seed-vessel, with the nectareous passages and the corolla,
 all rolled up together into a little ball. These, when they start
from the line of life, possess a juice of a peculiar kind which
precedes them, and arranges the wcod-vessels as it passes, in
king them all bend from it thus              :   so   that there is actually
a large   space between the bud and the wood filled up with sap-
jelly : nor is it possible the bud can be even touched, much more
injured ; since this hollow space is left for it till it reaches its
scales,- already prepared in the bark for its reception.     There is
not, perhaps, any of the contrivances of Nature more beautiful
than this, or which has been so strangely misunderstood : if the
bud had had to force its way, it would have been destroyed.         In
following the process, it is but cutting away the wood near where
there are buds; as you approach one it becomes softer and softer,
at last the liquid is discovered, and in the midst of it the little
delicate embryo, lying in its bath or jelly-case, while a covered
way near an inch before it is already prepared for its advance
ment.      As it approaches the bark, its inclosure or cradle is
ready for it,   with all the conveniences selected for its preserva
 tion; and generally      a quantity of hairs or points covering the
outward scales of the bud, to introduce into the interior, or the
 ball, all the nourishment the most delicate creature can require;
 for there are few buds that are not at that time of the year loaded
 with hairs and instruments.       Though    Ican find no analogy in
 the human frame for this process, yet          doubt not,

 sessed the liquid,  it  would assimilate well with the gastric juice.
 That so delicate, so soft    amatter as a bud should pass unhurt
 through perhaps a     foot or two of hard wood (for       must do so

 the method is    explained.
                                                                       Having

90            Comparative Anatomy; or an Attempt at
     Having now described those parts of the human body and
vegetable frame, on which their figure, support, strength, and
motion depend ; we must next examine those juices which are
intended to replace the waste of both the machines, and to sup
ply them with new energies.           In the animal body are many more
sorts    of liquid  than  in the vegetable, because these are so many
secretions from the blood: now this is unknown in plants.             The
animal blood is a rich store of nutritious fluid, fine enough to
penetrate its minutest parts, and which constantly circulates
through its whole machine : the elements of its composition are
furnished by all our food.         Now in the vegetable there are but
 two sorts of liquid that        can  be said to replace the waste of its
substance,     —  the bark -juice and sap : the first, far from being
 formed in the body, is merely collected there from the atmosphere
 by the hairs, in one of the layers of the leaf, from which place
 it runs to the inner bark-vessels.         It has no circulation like the
 blood; nor is it formed by       the  food, but taken in when separate,
 and mixed in the pabulum of the leaf.             The bark-juices are so
 far from being Capable of circulating, that their tendency to co
  agulate is such, that the bark is full of large species ot matter
 escaped from its liquid state ; and even in the vessels of the inner
 bark (if it was not for their peculiar construction) ifrwould never
 retain its liquid form, since it is forced through apertures not
  half the size of the vessels in which it runs; and this impetus, by
  increasing the violence of the action, tends to its fluidity.. The
  sap  is,   however, better adapted to play the part of the blood,
  were    not a  circulating medium totally unfit and unsuiled to the
  vegetable orm.
             f         A   being increasing at each of its numerous ex
  tremities, receiving its blood from another body, and that Mood
  coagulating into a jelly          byrest and suspension, before    itcan
  form its compound, — can such          make be compatible with a con
                                         a
  stant circulation of blood    ?   which cannot stop without destroying
  life. The proving that the sap-juices do not circulate        is   of the
  greatest consequence     :   if they circulate, and all the juices that
  should (when they arrive at the extremities) instead of forming
  the new shoot, run down again through the bark, — how              is the
  new shoot to be completed? since all that matter which was to.
  form it    is employed in returning through the bark, leaving the
  only part which at that time required support and moisture.             Is
it    not more natural to suppose that the juices (as they always
  become     a jelly before they are wood are arrested to be converted
                                             )
   into that   matter,   and then complete their change  ?     The idea of
   circulation drawn from the comparison of animal life, just only
                  is
 in    a few instances, misleading in almost every other.        Is   there
   not a great difference between an animal which grows not at its
    extremities, but which after the first few years ceases to increase,

and one   which increases every season at every joint, whose juices
are  independent of itself, and taken from another, and may na
turally be supposed, therefore, to draw up only that liquid which
is necessary for that increase ?   But if there were a circulating
law established by Nature for the sap, it would most probably
be a universal law, general to all plants : What then would
become of those trees and shrubs which lose their bark in the
winter   ?   whose vessels        are    supposed by some botanists to con
vey the sap ?      If
               they remain, they would be doubly conspicuous,
when the rest had departed ; and they are certainly not to be
found. A trifling piece of the green bark is discovered in the
winter, and the rest of the space is empty, and the inner bark
vessels are generally deprived of their juices.                How is then the
sap   to convey    its  circulation  ?   If  we  are   to  assert  that the sap
descends again after its ascent, we must show in what vessels.
If in the wood-vessels ? the bark could not hold a tenth part, as
I shall show.        If in the bark-vessels ? then must we discover
the anastomoses or joinings of both series of vessels, that                    is,

     -         Comparative   Anatomy; or an Attempt at
   The quantity of sap always found in the sap-vessels plainly
shows'   their office : if then there were returning sap-vessels,
would they not be equally plain and visible, whether in the bark
or wood P Besides, except the inner- bark vessels, all the cylin
ders that can convey juices pass either round the tree or in a
transverse direction.
   I have but one more argument with which I shall trouble the
reader.    It is said that the sap after mounting to the top of the
tree all  descends   again, and returns through the bark. Now the
bark is in summer one-tenth or eighth part of the wood, and
preserves in its decrease (as it mounts the tree) nearly the sanur
ratio. Suppose, therefore, a a to be the bark; and bb thg
wood ; and as the wood was full of sap- vessels, it is not possible
to cram them in less than half that space: the ratio be must,
therefore, be added to a a, yet not increase its size.     This is
indeed adding much to a little and making it less.     Had Nature
intended the sap-vessels or juices to return into the bark, a con
 spicuous place would have been allotted for them ; but they are
 now sought in vain.        It will be remembered that it is at all
 times the sap is supposed to circulate when the bark is quite full
 of its own juices, the sap must indeed then be invisible.
    The absorbent vessels are perhaps Loth in the animal and
vegetable one of the most curious parts of their formation.        In
the human body they are various : those that open their extre
mities under the different surfaces of the skin are called ex-
halants — of these the vegetables possess but a few, since they per
spire not, and it is only under the first cuticle of the leaf they
are discovered : but there are other absorbent vessels which take
in from the atmosphere (even in the human frame) many juices
and gases favourable to health, and which I doubt not increase
the nourishment of the body ; and though they are not near so
numerous as the hairs of vegetables (which are of such a variety
of kinds), yet they so increase with tlie vigour of the body, and
in hard-working people, that I doubt not they are intended to
supply much nutriment.         In the vegetable it is well known that
they do so, and that they have absorbent vessels leading to each
hair, to throw the matter thus acquired into the nourishing ves
sels ; and probably they would not increase under such existing
circumstances in the human body, but for some such purpose.          I
doubt not but that those who eradicate hairs, from the silly no
tion of beautifying their Maker's work, acquire many disorders
in the skin that would never be theirs but for this foolish cus
tom.     All hairs arise from two distinct capsules, one within the
other, having a certain degree of moisture between them ; and
the only difference between the human' and com mon vegetable
hair     that the latter has many more valves, and has frequently
         is,

a   spiral within the interior cylinder.             The human hair shows
not that variety         of shape ; three or four sorts are all that are
ever discovered.          But in the vegetable there is scarcely a form
possible     that   is not  imitated : but these I call instruments, not
 hairs, since they much more resemble the various invented glasses
 of a laboratory than the simplicity of a hair ; to each of these,
 however, an absorbent vessel is added to convey the juices thus
 acquired to their various places of destination ; while those vessels
 in the human body are thin pellucid' cylinders arising from the
 various surfaces of the skin, and running to a common duct
 called the thoracic duct.          They are of two kinds, the lymphatics
 and the lacieals.         The first the vegetables possess, but not the
 last.    The lymphatics take up the colourless fluid called lymph
  (whence they have received their name), and convey it from all
 the parts of the body to the same point.               Thus the parts of the
 blood, which either from their thin oily or nutritive qualities had
 been separated from the red blood or circuiting mass and thrown
 out by the exhaling arteries, are absorbed after having performed
 their' various uses, and are again conducted by the lymphatics into
 the circulation.         But the vegetable having no secretions from
 the blood, the lymphatics receive from the absorbent vessels those
juices introduced from the atmosphere by particular hairs, and
 which are partly secreted in the glands till wanted.                 The rest
 (after     performing     their   various   purposes)   are  carried  into the
nourishing       or   sap-vessels.    But  in  one point  of resemblance   both
agree ;   —   absorption in both bodies helps to remove those injuries
which happen to the frame by accidents.                  If a tumour proceed
from a blow or cut, the absorbents will soon begin to act : a fluid
poured from its ruptured vessels will be absorbed by its lympha
tics and carried again into circulation.             The black or green spot
which is left will disappear,          and  be  taken  up in both ; fresh sup
plies of wholesome nourishment are brought from every part to
recruit the bad flesh or wood that has been injured : and in the
plant, so great is the haste made to remedy the defect of this
kind, that it rarely happens that a wound is made without such
a quantity of nutriment being sent to the part that it generally
finishes by being a nursery for new burls.                  The absorbents of
 both beings are full of valves ; and as to the glands which secrete
 the oil and other matters, they are certainly in the vegetable as
 well as the human form, though not so numerous : the two nec
 taries of the flower are of this kind. sSome excretory ducts also
plants must possess ; since much matter is conveyed away that
 would otherwise impede the flow of the sap : for when the new
 wood is formed, all the old divisions of the piece which had been
 before bark, disappear quickly, but not so nastily as not to show
it is drawn off by degrees by some vessels appropriated for the
       t  ,                                                            purpose.

 and equally well managed.
     The analogy between the animal and vegetable foetus, in re
 aped to their production, nutriment, and oxygenation, is indeed
 very striking and forcible.
    The ovum in the female is discovered at an early period in
 the virgin state, as is the seed of the tree ; and like that, many
 years pass before the tree arrives at its proper maturity; but they
 both attain that point of perfection at an earlier period in warm
 countries than in cold.      The ovum in the female resembles a
 lunch of grapes fastened as they are to the umbilical cord ; and
 when the seed is first formed in the side roots, it is an apparent
gross powder, which soon becomes regular balls, and which tied
to the line of life, may well be likened to grapes also ; — but in
 one respect they evidently differ.     The ovum moves not till after
 impregnation    has taken   place;  whereas   the seed has travelled
 far and gone almost all its journey, before it receives the powder
 of the stamen.
    Mirbel says, the vessels in the style unite with those in the
peduncle and form the umbilical cord.            But Mirbel was not
 aware that the seed rising from the root had already received
 (from the first moment of its existence) its umbilical cord (which
is indeed its life), when it is fixed in the flower (at the time he
 alludes to), a long season after its real birth; it then first runs up
 the interior of the style (which had till then been empty) and
increases greatly; when the seed is to be impregnated it swells,and
serves as the vehicle to receive the pollen, which soon dissolving
in the sweet juices of the line of life, runs down again to each
seed, which it touches; when the heart is directly filled up, and
the seminal leaves (the lungs of the embryo) proceeding from
the interior cavity under the heart, begin to grow.
    In the first months of pregnancy the involucra bear a large
proportion to their contents, but afterwards this proportion is
reversed.     This is also the case with the seed, which evidently
changes in this respect, though much quicker than the foetus.
The placenta (which is the medium through which the blood is
conveyed from the mother to the foetus) is a soft spongy substance
like a cake, closely adhering to the inner surface of the womb ;
and the arteries of the uterus discharge their contents into this
substance of the cake, and thus form the umbilical cord which is
to nourish the child. Now this is most exactly imitated in the
seed, except in the last circumstance, where another vessel called
the nourishing vessel supplies the place of the umbilical cord,
in respect to yielding nutriment to the embryo : since there is a
broad spongy substance on the interior surface of the seed, ex
actly resembling a cake; and before the seed is divided from its
                                                                mother

 mother tree, a certain set of veins arising in the branch from
 which the seed proceeds, and passing through the cover into the
 interior, is thoroughly filled with a proper liquid, to be used as
toon as the division takes place : the seed is then divided from
 the tree, and the vein closed, which has in the mean time spread
 all its meandering branches on the cake, and now open their
 tiny mouths to produce (with the joint juices of that spongy
 matter) the sort of milky fluid to nourish the young plant, till
 the root is formed for the purpose.         But the seed has one ad
                                      " at the first shooting of the
 vantage unknown to the foetus:          if
 root it is' destroyed, the cake again receives the last juices re
 maining in the nourishing vessels, and forms with its assistance
milk sufficient to supply the young one with support till the
 growth of the root is renewed."          It may however be said, that
 the child is not exposed to a similar disaster, and requires not
therefore such a remedy.         This exact imitation of the foetus
with the embryo shows that I was right in persisting that the
seminal leaves had nothing to do in nourishing the plant, and
were merely formed to protect the embryo when leaving its ex
terior cover, and to serve as lungs to the young plant ; and that,
so far from bestowing nutriment, it required more itself than any
other part.      I showed this before I knew hour the human foetus
was managed in this respect, and could not therefore be misled
by the analogy, which is but too often the ease when the know
ledge of human anatomy precedes the dissection of botanical ob
jects.     The different covers also of the seed may be compared
to the true and spongy chorion ; the last is opaque and thick like
the white cover of the seed, and the interior clear, as is the first
envelope of the young one, while the heart of the seed first floats
in a liquor that may well be compared to the liquor amnii.,: It
is curious that in the latter months of pregnancy the spongy
chorion becomes gradually thinner and more connected with the
true chorion, which is also the case with the stony fruit and
 seed.    The seed is so easily divided from the mother plant, is
 obliged to receive that assistance from the cover of its seed the
 child receives from its mother, and which nutriment the seed
 took in fror% its parent plant as long as it preserved its hold.
 The innumerable open-mouthed vessels in the outward exterior
 «f its case, take in both juices and gases, to be seen flowing into
 the interior and changing constantly.          It is truly astonishing t,o
  see the excessive   assistance of this   sort   the seed receives daily
 before it is again placed in the ground, and before it forms its
  radicle: in opening one seed each day, I have rarely found it
  without some new vessels running from the exterior.             The seed
 is of course infinitely quicker     in   forming     than the  foetus ; fox

    There are some curious changes in the form of a child before
it breathes, and there is also a most curious difference in the se
minal leaves in a plant when compared with other plants.          They
have no spiral wire, and of course no motion, and no midrib or
side-ribs : this is very conspicuous in the Mimosa sensitiva,
since it is the only part that does not move if touched.        It was
one of the proofs that enabled me to ascertain that the spiral
wire was the real muscle of the plant.
    There is little resemblance between the lungs of a human
being and the leaves of trees — nevertheless they perform for each
being the same office ; and yet it is difficult to draw a compari
son between them.         The human lungs fill the greater part of
the cavity of- the breast ; they are of a soft spongy texture, and
are divided into two lobes, which are separated from each other
by the mediastinum, and externally covered by a production cf the
pleura : each of these is divided into two or three lesser lobes,
are commonly three in the right and two in the left side of the
 cavity.     There are two series of arteries which carry blood to
the lungs, and it is the exposition of this blood on the surface
which changes its tint from a darker colour to a lighter red.
The pulmonary artery and veins are not intended for the nutri
 ment of the lungs; but the blood in its passage through them is
 destined to undergo those changes, and become florid by a greater
mixture of oxygen.        Respiration constitutes one of those func
 tions which are properly termed vital, as being essential to life:
it consists of an alternate contraction and dilatation of the thorax,
by first inspiring air into the lungs, and then expelling it from
 them hy exspiralion.       When an animal has once breathed, it is
easy   to  see  how  the motion   may be continued ; but what occa
sioned the first inspiration is not s6 easy to discover.
    Now the difference to be discovered in the lungs of plants           is,
that they have little inspiration of air except in water-plants, —
but most of the oxygen given out          taken in as water, then de
                                          is
composed;      the  hydrogen   drawn off,  and secreted for the seeds,
while    the  oxygen     again given out to the amosphere to purify
                         is
and invigorate it. The two upper cuticles of the leaf yield oxy
gen, the under cuticle takes         carbonic acid gas

   power enough to decompose         the liquid.    Then what clouds of
   apparent smoke pour from every hedge         or tree, filling the morn
   ing air with vapour ! 1 doubt not also that much of this pure
   gas is  given out when the leaf forms its pabulum, from the de
   composition of the several juices the hairs have collected to com
   pose this new compound, in which all vital air is banished.           Nor
   is it improbable that the hairy points may help in a bright day to
   decompose and set at liberty the oxygen of the bubbles of water
   without further process, as it certainly occurs to the green mat
   ter or fresh water conferva in Priestley's experiment,           which is
   owing to the fine points of both.         As those insects which have
   spiracula or breathing apertures, as wasps and flies, are imme
   diately suffocated if oil be poured on them, so the leaves (if a brush
   is merely passed over them, giving them a simple varnish of oil)
   directly grow black and die.       The confining the air within them,
   and stopping all their natural functions, is sufficient to kill them.
   That some thick flowers serve as respiratory organs as well as
   the leaves, I have no doubt, since there are in most of them open
   air-vessels for the purpose : when without leaves, therefore, the
   petals serve as lungs to the plant, as they always have that cir
   cular vessel alternately holding air or water surrounding them.
       A tree in the winter will bear the closest confinement ; but the
   moment its leaves appear and open, if it has not plenty of air it
   dies : hence the number killed in a hot day in spring.           Nothing
   can be more different than the skin of a human being and the
   cuticle of a plant: in one point only they agree — that they have
   both many layers.      The human cutis which covers the flesh is
   composed    of fibres closely compacted, through which the ends of
  the nerves appear which give out perspiration, and on which skin
  innumerable pupillce are discovered coiled up, or spread out, and
  which seem to be calculated to receive the impressions of thetouch,
  being the most in i;uantity where the sense of feeling is the most
, delicate, as in the palms of the hands and the fingers.              This
  skin, which will stretch to any extent and contract again, has
  been known in cases of dropsy to stretch a foot or two, and re
  duce itself when the water was discharged.               It is always of a
  white colour, while the matter which covers it and lies between
  the cutis and epidermis is that which gives the tint to the fair,
  brown, or black person.        This is called the rete mucosura ; it is
  a mucous substance. which may be dissolved in water, and which
  in negroes is quite black.       Next to this is the epidermis or scarf
  skin. It is a fine transparent insensible pellicle, destitute of nerves
  and blood-vessels, and every where covering the true skin, which
  invests the body.      It is in 'reality composed of several laminae or
  scales, and is full of pores, through which the perspiration passes

98            Comparative     Anatomy ; or an Attempt at
 from   the ends of the nerves on the cutis.       The use of this last
 skin is to protect the delicate nervous fibres which stand out
 from the true skin : it increases by pressure ; and the more
 scales are added, the less that nervous sensibility is felt.       This
 is the reason that hard-working people can put their           hands  in
 the fire or in extreme hot water, without being sensible of pain :
the more this skin is increased, the less feeling they possess.
    As the plant has no nerves, it can have no feeling; and as it
 has no perspiration, it can have no pores.          The marks seen in
 the skin are merely the effect of the opening of the balls in the
 aecond and third cuticle, which contain first the water and then
 the oxygen.     The first cuticle is perfectly impervious to water,
 and completely like gold-beater's         skin, without figure.     Air,
 however, passes    it freely: but for this skin, how   could  the water
 be retained to be decomposed?
    I have said that there is no perspiration in plants ; indeed it
 was perfectly impossible that the vegetables could decompose
 water to give out oxygen, and at the same time perspire such
 quantities — and yet have juices enough left to support the plant.
 It seems to me that the incomparable Mirbel almost owned his
 unbelief long ago: — that those bubbles taken for water have
 proved to be instruments of various kinds and forms, and show
 themselves to be -undoubtedly the most beautiful and compli
 cated part of the vegetable arrangement.         As in the animal body
 there are such a variety of secretions from the blood, which re
 quire an immense mechanism, not suited to the general simplicity
 of the form of a plant, so in its stead Nature has contrived that/
 it should receive from the atmosphere, by means of these instru
 ments or hairs, all the juices necessary to the vegetable, in lieu
 of forming them by secretion: but they are not received in their
 perfect state, but often alter greatly between their entering the
 valve and flowing into the plant: nay, I have frequently known
 two liquids enter the hairs and secrete themselves between the
 two different valves; thep meeting explode, and compose a third
juice, and thus form by chemical affinity the matter which the
 plant requires.      This is really the most beautiful part of the
 study  of plants ;   and  to chemists would (I should conceive) serve
 as an elucidation to many points, if they would condescend to
 try them. Even oil is received by the hairs in a sort of vapour,
 and only becomes oil when it reaches the first liquid ; and they
 both enter the third valve purified and completed.               I have
 watched the various liquids innumerable times ; nay, I might.
 truly say, for months together — their manner of filling and empty «
 ing their hairs— the variety of their juices — the curious changes
 made ip them — and the getting rid of the obnoxious part by
 means of the outward cuticle of the hair, and then sending down
                                                                     into

into the plant that which is completed.        This account would
fill volumes instead of a few pages, if thorough justice were done
to so beautiful and inimitable a contrivance.      But what pen or
what tongue can properly display the works of Him who can con
ceive and form such productions             !
    Between the skin or cutis, and the muscles or flesh, there is
interposed a loose oily substance.          It is continued without inter
ruption    over  the  whole   exterior  of  the  muscles, and is called the
cellular substance, filling up their depressions, and affording a
smooth and regular surface for the skin to lie upon.               This sub
stance is composed of a cellular texture and fat : the latter is
fluid in the body, and is deposited in cells in the former for fa
cilitating muscular motion ; and though found in the greatest
quantity in the cells of the membrane filling up the space be
 tween the most external muscles of the skin, yet it may be met
 with in most other parts of the body.              Just so is the vegetable
pith, composed of a cellular texture, filling up the depressions
 the line of life frequently makes in its curious undulations, which
 every other part is obliged to follow : the only difference         is, that
    is not placed       the same situation, but owing to the softness
                         in
of it
    its texture    it admits of the wood in very vigorous trees in
 creasing    both ways, and allowing also of the yearly swelling
 of  the line of life, when the bud passes up its cylinders, from
 the root upwards.         The pith serves also to contaiti water, in
 stead of fat  ;  and      its quick growth supplies each vacancy till
                              by
 the wood   is  able to fill its situation.
    Having now brought forward (though in so imperfect a
sketch) each different ingredient possible to compare together
m the human form and vegetable frame                   let me now see what
                                                          ;
results may be drawn from the comparison.                 First it  proves,I
think, that the vegetable frame                a mere muscular creature,
                                                is
having life only, but no sensation —720 sensibility, but possess
ing alone the property of the muscles {irritability) . The com
parison proves also        matter of great consequence

                    that as the only part         theinhuman    body possess
ing self-motion (independent of all other parts) or vis insita             is
the muscle, so the only part in the plant possessing the same

deavoured to show by other arguments,              as   never  yet could find
motion in any part that did not possess the spiral wire, and that
the motion was always in proportion to the quantity or peculiar
formation of the muscle: as the tendril of the vine admirably
shows, which        composed of little else.

   Most of the accounts descriptive of the human body are se
lected from our best surgical books ; Hunter, Haller, Monro,
Burk, and Cooper. I have since, however, regretted I did not
form the comparison between the insect or amphibia tribe. and the
vegetable, as, certainly approaching nearer together, they would
admit a more perfect similitude; but I was fearful the dissection
of the insect tribe would not be sufficiently known, to interest ; —
or the lungs of the frog's foetus are so like the part of the leaf
which serves as lungs to the plant ; and the admirable manner in
which the muscles of the snail display themselves, so well dis
criminate its different parts of tendon, muscle or moving part,
and the nerve to which it is attached, as to take away all obscu -
rity from the subject; which is however with* the least attention
plain enough.    The inimitable Swammerdam, who studied the
muscles most deeply, thinks their internal motion may arise
from a similar cause with those of the vegetable.

The    juice of several other fruits, besides those of limes and le
mons, will furnish the citric acid, either alone or mixed with other

It may also be worth mentioning, that sometimes there is a large
quantity of damaged tamarinds in the market, which might be
bought cheap enough for the use of calico-printers, and which
would afford their citric acid to calcareous earth, in the same way
as the common lemon juice.                 Vauquelin, who has made direct

     It would be improper to dismiss this subject before we speak
 of the application and general uses of the citric acid.
     Besides the medicinal* uses to which the citric acid is applied,
 such as the making; of saline draughts, &c., it is often combined
 with opium to prevent the stupifying effects of that very power
 ful narcotic ; and I have been told that it has been given with good
 effect to counteract such an over-dose of it as would otherwise
 have proved fatal.         In domestic ceconoiny the citric acid is em
 ployed with advantage as a condiment for a variety of food, it
 being more grateful than vinegar on account of the fine aroma
 derived from the essential oil peculiar to the rind of this fruit.
 Likewise for taking out iron-moulds or other stains of iron ; as
 this metal is not only soluble in citric acid, but the solution is so
 permanent that it is not precipitated again by the application
 of soap, which sometimes happens when other salts are used for
 this purpose.       It is useful also for removing spots occasioned by
 alkalies, or the alkaline earths, from scarlet cloth ; — for making
 a solution of iron for bookbinders,           to give the mottled appear -
 arice to the surface of calf-skin ; — for improving that peculiar
solution of tin which is employed for producing the most exquisite
specimens of the scarlet dye; — for altering the hue of some colours
which are used in the dyeing of silk ; — for the preparation of the
best Morocco-leather ; — for improving candles, by whitening and
hardening the tallow which is employed in making them.
    A very considerable quantity of citric acid, in the state of le
mon-juice, is also consumed by the seamen of the British navyf.
It was formerly bought in this market, having first been submitted
to the judgement of a respectable chemist, who was regularly
employed for the purpose.               As the managers of this depart
ment have found that it can be brought from Sicily at a much
more reasonable price, and of the best quality, they now procure
it from that island, and decline all other sources.            To preserve it
on long voyages, about ten gallons of brandy are generally put
to every 100 gallons of juice, which has the effect of precipitating
the mucilage, that otherwise would not fail, during a voyage, to
throw the whole into a state of fermentation, and convert much.
of it into vinegar.        Dize', in his Memoir read to the Institute of
France, says, that a lemonade of the most agreeable taste and
appearance may be made by dissolving forty grains of citric acid
in a pint of water, with the addition of a sufficient quantity of
refined sugar, and that it may be rendered fragrant by dissolving
in it a small quantity of oleosaccharum, prepared by rubbing a

 decayed will do), lie removes the peel and the skin that adheres
to   it,and slices them into a vessel, which ought not to be made
of wood. He then sprinkles them with quantity of good vine   a
gar; squeezes out the juice through             flannel, a     means of    by                     a

on  Calico-printing.
   The person who first prepared this acid in large quantities in
England, and principally for the use of the calico-printers, was
Mr. Coxwell, late of Fleet-street, who sold     at a high price, in
                                                                 it
the form of neat white crystals.      With this the printers were
supplied for many years but when the demand became greater
                                    ;
than he could well answer, he began to furnish them with the
brown crystals, that     with the acid in the first stage of cry
                              is,
stallization, and consequently at a much more reasonable price.
   This urged the printers pretty generally to turn their attention
to the preparation of the citric acid  and now most of the houses
                                                    ;

be kept in well stopped bottles, unimpaired, for any length of time.         This is
preferable to the volatile oil of lemons, obtained by distillation, for the fire ge

essential oils.

 buy lemon-juice for themselves, and use it in different states of
 concentration, according to the nature of the processes to which
 it is to be adapted.
     For most of the styles of work in which citric acid is employed,
 they find that the common impurities in lemon-juice are of very
little consequence; and that when the juice itself has undergone
 no other process than that of being concentrated by evaporation,
 it very well answers their purpose, and supersedes the use of the
 crystallized acid.                                                             .>
     As there is always abundance of spare heat in every large ca
 lico-print work, the process of evaporation may be conducted at
no expense ; and if it be continued very slowly for some con
siderable time, the acid will be ,sufficiently concentrated, and
this without waste.        For when the evaporation is thus managed,
the vapour which arises will carry off none of the acid ; and when
it arrives at a certain point of concentration most of the muci
lage will be separated, one part of which generally rises to the
surface, and the other precipitates.
     It is time, however, to come to the particular point which
first induced me to think of writing on this subject, namely, the
knowledge of this circumstance, that the printers depend solelv
on the hydrometer for ascertaining the goodness of lemon-juice,
which made me very desirous of recommending to them some
less fallacious guide.                                                            .
    Various reasons may be adduced to show the uncertainty of
the hydrometer, but one or two will suffice.                 It is possible, for
instance, that two parcels of juice may appear to differ very much
when examined by the hydrometrical test, from the difference of
the quantity of mucilage, though the same parcels may be of
equal goodness as to the produce of the crystals, or real acid
that may be procured from them.                   In like manner, a pipe of
lemon-juice may be sophisticated with other acids, so as to make
it pass the hydrometer, and yet be worth little for the printer'*
USe.
     On these accounts it appears to me that there can be no safety
in purchasing this article, unless the buyer avail himself of the
use of chemical tests *.                   . .
     Whenever,     therefore,    a parcel of lemon -juice is offered for
sale, the first thing should be to take its specific gravity by the
hydrometer, or by a gravity bottle, and note that down. Should
it prove to be only of the specific gravity of about 1 '0156, which
is 16 ounces 4 drachms to the wine pint, it may at once be re
jected as not worth purchasing ; for, good juice varies from a
    * An experienced calico-printer has assured me that fine wheat flour is some
times employed to adulterate lemon-juke.      It certainly may be so incorporated
 wkh the mucilage as to affect the hydrometer considerably.
                                                                         specific

ipecific gravity of 1*0312 (16 ounces 8 drachms) to that of
1-0625, or 17 ounces avoirdupois the wine pint.
     Should the parcel appear good by the hydrometer, take then,
for the next experiment, a wine glass of the juice, dilute it plen
tifully with pure water, and add to it a few drops of a solution
of acetate of lead, as directed at page 5 1 : this will produce an
immediate precipitate,          chiefly of citrate of lead, which should
then be treated with a little pure nitrous acid, and the effect
carefully observed; for, if the nitrous acid dissolve the whole of
the precipitate, it will prove that the juice under examination
 contains no sulphuric acid.             By proceeding in the same way
 with an acidulous solution of nitrate of silver *, instead of acetate
 of lead, it will be seen whether the juice contains any muriatic
 acid ; this and the sulphuric being the only two acids, except the
 acetic, that are ever likely to be employed in the adulteration of
 lemon-juice.
     There were indeed instances, when lemon-juice was scarce in
 the market, of its being adulterated with vinegar ; and should
 this occur again, it maybe readily detected by saturating a sam
 ple of the juice with carbonate of lime (whiting or pure chalk),
 and when the calcareous citrate precipitates, taking the specific
 gravity of the supernatant liquor.             For, as lime is entirely solu
 ble in acetic acid, part of the whiting- employed will be held in
 solution by the vinegar, and occasion the supernatant liquor to
be specifically heavier than it would have been had the sophisti
 cation not been practised.
     To render this fact more certain, I made the following experi
 ment.       Having purchased a few good lemons, and pressed out
 the juice, I found its spec, gravity to be 1-0384.                 This was put
 into a capacious phial bottle, and when loosely corked was placed
in a secure place in my common sitting-room, the temperature
of which was usually at about 60 degrees.                     When it was ex
 amined at the end of sixteen days, the mucilage had in a great
 measure deposited, and the specific gravity of the juice was found
 reduced to that of 1-0352.
     The weight of the juice under experiment, and after it had
 passed the filter, was 2400 grains, and the deposited mucilage
 weighed 133 grains, or one nineteenth of the whole.
     The clear juice being divided into two equal portions, to one
 of them a fourth of its weight of common vinegar was added.
 Finding that the unadulterated portion amounted to 1200 grains,

  clear supernatant liijuor, and preserve it iu a stopped phial for use.
                                                                                an

     an equal quantity was taken of that which contained vinegar
     mixed with       it,and both these parcels were accurately saturated
     with carbonate of lime*, and left 24 hours undisturbed until the
     citrate of lime thus composed should be deposited.
        On pouring off the supernatant liquors from the two parcels
     of calcareous citrate, and drying both their precipitates equally,
     the following results presented themselves.           The citrate of lime
     from the pure juice, when perfectly dried, weighed 138 grains,
     while that from the adulterated parcel weighed only 129 grains.
     The specific gravity of the supernatant liquor from the former
     was 1-0076, or 16 ounces and            drachms to the wine pint

                                                                       it

    vered   by  the application of another chemical test.
        For instance, the fruit of which           was made may have been
                                                       it
    gathered      in  an  unfavourable   month,     after the descent of the
    heavy rains     ; or deteriorated         by
                                             the spontaneous decomposition
     which  is  occasioned by age        or
                                          ;    may have been diluted with
                                                  it

                                                                       it   is
     how many hands the juice has passed through before                   comes       it
     into the possession of the consumer.
        The mode which naturally suggests itself of ascertaining this
    point,  is   by  means of an alkali     for,

.   going tests that the juice contains no admixture of other acids,
     the amount of the crystals of citric acid which             will yield will
                                                                       it
    be in exact proportion to the quantity of alkali which              requires it
    for its saturation.
        To adapt this theory to practice, all that          necessary
                                                                 is        to se      is

    paper, and its specific gravity noted down,               will be ready for

    ever occasion requires.
      It   will be necessary also to procure some of the test-paper

    Hme, whereas the same weight of acid previously sophisticated with vinegar took

 which is generally used for acids and alkalies.            For this end, I
    kuow of none better than the common blue litmus paper, which
    may be bought in London by the sheet.             This paper should be
    kept in a stoppered bottle, or closely folded in paper, to preserve
   it from the action of the atmosphere, as well as from the light,
    and this will always prove an excellent test to discover the pre
   sence of an acid, which changes the blue to a red ; and the same
   paper, being slightly tinged by means of a very dilute acid, be
   comes equally delicate as a test for alkalies.        A very weak mix
   ture of vinegar and water answers this purpose.
      The use which the printer will have to make of these papers,
   is to ascertain when the portion of lemon-juice under examina
   tion is exactly saturated with the alkali.          He may, therefore,
   proceed with it in the following manner :
      Let one thousand grains, or any given quantity, of the lemon-
  juice be weighed out ; and having previously balanced a phial of
  the solution of alkali in an accurate pair of scales, let a portion
  of the alkali be gradually added to the juice, which should be
  well stirred with a glass rod, or poured from one vessel to an
  other, between every additiou of the alkali.            When the effer
  vescence seems to grow less, a slip of the blue test-paper should
  be dipped in to ascertain whether          the mixture approaches the
  point of saturation.    If  the paper  comes   out red, it indicates that
  the acid still predominates, and more alkali must therefore be cau
 tiously dropped in. After waiting a minute or two, to allow
 time for them to unite, another slip of test-paper is to be ap
 plied, and in this way repeated until the liquor has lost the power
 of occasioning any change in the colour of the test.
      When this is the case, a slip of the reddened test-paper should
 be dipped in, which will acquire a blue colour if too much of
 the alkali has been used ; but if the liquor be brought to that
 state that it will cause no visible change of colour in either the red
 or the blue litmus paper, the lemon-juice may then be considered
 to be accurately saturated, and brought to the neutral state.
      Now, replace the phial of dilute alkali in the scale, note down
 how many grains in weight are requisite to balance           it,   and call
 this   the quantity of alkali  expended   in saturating  the juice.  When
.the operator has    by   previous experiment      determined    how   much
      his standard alkali      necessary to saturate any given quantity
of of
                          is
      the pure crystals of citric acid, he may at once,      by   the com
 mon rule of proportion, say how much solid citric acid             is con
  tainedin    any particular sample      of  lemon-juice   which   has been
  submitted to the    tests  already  described.
      The method now recommended of examining the goodness of
  lemon-juice, will answer the purpose of any individual so far as
   respects his own purchases  ;     but as the pearl ash of commerce
                                                                   contains

contains different proportions of impurity, and the crystals of
soda are liable to effloresce, and thence to hold variable quan
tities of the water of crystallization, neither of these is fit for
forming a standard by which both the buyer and seller may
arrive at the same estimate of the value of any given parcel of
juice.
     Conceiving, however, that this would he a very desirable thing,
 I  have   thought of various expedients, and know of nothing which
would be so generally convenient for effecting this purpose as the
 common salt of tartar of the shops, which, if bought of a re
 spectable chemist, will be found to be a tolerably pure sub-car
 bonate of potash ; and if this be preserved in a well-stoppered
 bottle from the action of moisture, it will be a useful test for the
 purpose under consideration.
      In order to lay the foundation for a table of the quantities of
 pure alkali which are taken up by this acid in various states of
 concentration, I prepared some of this sub-carbonate of potash,
 and found that 544 grains of such alkali are required to saturate
 one ounce avoirdupois, or 437.5 grains of pure dry solid crystals
 of citric acid ; or, that one ounce and a quarter, omitting frac
 tions, will render neutral one ounce of the crystallized citric acid.
      Conceiving, however, that, for the purposes of business, a so
 lution of potash in pure water might be more generally useful
 than the dry salt of tartar, I formed an aqueous solution of that
 alkali, somewhat below the point of complete saturation, by dis
 solving two ounces and a half of the salt of tartar in thirteen
 ounces and a half of pure water, making in the whole one pound
 avoirdupois, and by means of this solution * the table No. II, at
 the end of this Essay, has been constructed.
      Notwithstanding the general certainty that must result from
 this mode of procuring the test, it occurred to me that it would
  be more convenient to some calico-printers to use soda.                  I there
 fore prepared some crystals of this alkali in a state of purity; and
 having carefully abstracted the water of erystallizationf, I found
 that 352 grains of this dry sub-carbonate of soda will accurately
 saturate an avoirdupois ounce of the pure crystals of the acid of
 lemons ; and on this result has the table been formed which is
 marked No. III.
     * These proportions of water and alkali were chosen, in order that the so
 lution might be of such a strength that eight ounces of it would accurately
  saturate as much lime-juice as should contain one ounce of pure solid crystals of
  citric acid. The specific gravity of such a solution at GO0, when filtrated, will
  be 1-120, or 17 oz. \1\ drachms to the wine pint.
     \  In order to separate the water of crystallization entirely, so as to procure
 * perfectly dry and impalpable powder of sub-carbonate of soda, it is necessary
  to expose the crystals to a very gentle and long continued heat ; for when dried
 hastily the pulverized crystals will be apt to melt in their own waler of crys:aK-
 lization, and become reconverted into a hard mass.              ,
                                                                                  It

     It   is worthy    of notice, that these tests may be employed, not
.only in purchasing        lime-juice, but also in ascertaining the quan
tity  of real  acid    in  acid  liquors of different degrees of concentra
tion ; a matter of considerable consequence to those printers who
are desirous of being accurate in the proportion of acid which
they design to use in any particular style of work.
   As some of the calico-printers in the North of England have
found it advantageous to buy lemon-juice for themselves, as men

portunity of suggesting, that when the juice has been partially
concentrated          bybeing exposed for some time to a very moderate
heat,      would
          it         be   useful to remove            to    situation where the

    To prevent the possibility of any misconception respecting the
nature   of these tables, it may be proper to state an example of
the use of each.        For instance, if it be required to examine a
parcel  of  lemon-juice by the dry salt of tartar, all that is neces
sary is to take ah ounce measure, or the sixteenth part of a wine
pint of such juice, and having noted the number of grains re
quired for its saturation, to look for the same number in the se
cond column of the first table, and opposite thereto, in the third
column, will be seen the quantity of crvstals of citric acid which
may be obtained from a gallon of such juice.            The Table No. II.
is constructed in the same manner, for the use of a solution of
salt of tartar to be prepared as directed at page 108.                 The
Table No. III. is contrived in a similar way, for the use of the
sub-carbonate of soda to be dried in the manner prescribed at
page   108.

XXIII.   Proposal        for   a new Regulation         of Weights and Mea
                     sures.      By A Correspondent.
                                To   Mr.   Tilloch.
8m,   — Perceiving       that you sometimes devote a portion of your
valuable publication to the consideration of weights and mea
sures, and as doubtless the bill at present before a select com
mittee of the House of Commons has been perused by the greater
part of your readers, I shall take the liberty of making a few re
marks on the subject, and lay before you a plan for the simplifi
cation of an uniformity of weights and measures.
    The great inconvenience which exists at present, owing to the
intricate state of our ponderal system, must be obvious to every
observer. This complicateness has long called for a remedy to pre
vent the inconceivable trouble arising therefrom, and to establish
one weight and one measure throughout the British empire. The
committee of the House of Commons of 175S paid most lau
dable attention to the subject, to establish a standard universal
and uniform.      The committee of the present time, under who«e
directions the above-mentioned bill was prepared, have followed
the former, and have even paid greater attention to                 it,
                                                                 endea    by
vouring   to simplify the system    but
                                      ; they  also. have not attempted
entirely to abolish the system at present in use,tbough such a thing
would be highly desirable.      The Royal Society also have exerted
themselves, and have even offered       premium for the discovery of
                                            a
 an invariable standard, —but none have appeared to be sufficient
for establishing an universal standard      the only ones which have
                                                :

 latelv established in France, and        said to be superior to the

other,   as being on a larger scale.   But the objection to it is the
 inequality  of the earth's surface;  for it has been found that the
 degrees of the meridian vary in different longitudes even in the
 same latitude. The mathematicians who established this system
 objected to that of the pendulum, as depending on gravitation and
 time. But gravitation is uniform in the same latitude; and with
 regard to time, it is universally so, as it solely depends on the
 earth's diurnal revolution round its axis, which has never been
 found to vary.     Thus, therefore, a superiority cannot be ascribed
 to the meridian system ; and as that of the pendulum is more
 easily performed with accuracy, it must enjoy a higher approval.
 Another plan that has been proposed^ is the space through
 which a heavy substance will fall in a second of time, which has
  been proved in the latitude of London to be 16-iVi;- feet: this is,
Jiowever, obviously too difficult to be performed with the requi
 site accuracy.
     The pendulum system is that approved of and taken as the
 standard by the committee of the House of Commons, the length
 of which in the latitude of London has been found to be 39* 13047
 inches, of which 36 are established as the legal standard for the
.yard, and 12- such inches a foot.        These subdivisions are cer
tainly  far from    deserving any great approbation ; but the com
mittee are not desirous of completely altering the present system,
 and therefore still retain its subdivisions.    From this measure that
.of liquid and the weights are effluent. And as the subdivisions
and multiples of our present system are too well known to re
 quire a recapitulation here, I shall proceed to give a scale that
.might be adopted in establishing an uniformity of weights and
measures.      It will be easily seen that it is founded on the system
established by the French Republic. The latter, as I have before
 remarked, is calculated from the arc of the meridian, and which,
by order of the French Government, was measured between the
.parallels of Dunkirk and Barcelona. But as that of the pendu
 lum is chosen by our Government, I shall make it the source of
.the plan :— the system of the pendulum is evidently more correct
 than the other, and that is more approvable.
    The length of a pendulum oscillating seconds in the latitude
 of London      is,
                 as   Ihave before stated, according to the committee
of the House of Commons, 39*13047 inches, of which 36 were
 to make the standard yard. Now            would be better to make the
                                          it
 pendulum    itself  the  unit for measures   retaining that name, and
so increasing and decreasing         by decimals, dividing the pendu
 lum into decimal parts progressively            by
                                                  10, and multiplying it
after the same manner.         Then shall we have     :
            1    Kilopendulum   =1000          pendulums
            1     Hecto......   ==   100        do.

          1  Milli             = -001 do.
    From this long measure proceeds that of liquid.                The gallon
at present in use contains 268 803 cubical inches, and is re
commended by the present committee to contain 276'48 cu
bical inches, or 10 lbs. avoirdupois, being 3 per cent, larger;
thus making the half-pint to contaiii 10 oz. or 17*28 cubical
inches of pure water of 56y° by Fahrenheit's thermometer.                This
gallon is by the above bill divided into four quarts, eight pints,
sixteen half-pints, though it would be a much enlargement of this
gallon : yet to have a strict comparison we might make it to con
tain ten cubical pendulums,
                    "
                                  or equal to 391*3047 cubical inches.
With this scale,

          1  Hecto            = 100             do.

          1  Milli            =         -001 do.
    From    these measures proceed         weights.      It  has been already
seen   that the gallon contains 10 lbs. pure water, whence lib.
pure water is equal to 27'648 cubical inches, according to the
standard named by the said bill; which pound is by the same di
vided into 16 oz. each ounce of 16 drachms 48 scruples, or 480
grains. Now, for the reasons before stated, let this pound con
tain l-10th of the gallon, or one cubical pendulum of pure wa
 ter, thus :                                                               .  .

          1  Milli          , =         -001 do.
    From the above measures the square measures might be                   de
 rived.   With regard to assaying metals, let both the carat and the
 ounce be abolished, and have another            carat to be subdivided into
  1000 parts,   to be used   both for   gold   and   silver.
     The next point I have to notice is the coinage. In this case
 also I would recommend a regular conformity with the weights
 and measures. This however might be laid over for the direction
                                      H    2                                 of

of the    Government ; since the consequence would be little even
 were the coins continued as they are. However, the moneys of
 account might be altered amongst the commercial world them
 selves, without any inconvenience, as making the guinea the unit,
 and dividing it into 10, 100, and 1000 parts, by a similar decimal
 division as that contained in the weights and measures.                 With
 regard to dry measure, that might be regulated by the liquid
 measure, retaining the same dimensions;             thus, the bushel con
 taining 10 gallons, or 3913'047 cubic inches, or 100 cubical
 pendulums; and other decimal divisions in proportion.
     Should this article meet your acceptance, 1 shall take the li
 berty of offering you a further communication on the subject; in
 which, however, I shall confine myself to a review of the bill now
 in the committee of the House of Commons.                 In recommending
 this to your protection,

 XXIV.      Some Observations on S t earn- Engines ; with a Table of
     Work done by certain Engines in Cornwall, from August
     1811 to May 1815, both Months inclusive: showing the
     monthly Consumption of Coals by the Engines reported; the
     Number of Pounds of Water lifted one Foot high by the
     Coals consumed ; and the average Work performed by each
     Bushel of Coals, expressed in Pounds of Water lifted one
     Foot high.
 In   the year 1811, a number of the respectable proprietors of the
 valuable tin and copper mines in Cornwall resolved to have the
 real work ascertained which their respective steam-engines were
 performing, as it was suspected that some of them might not be
 doing duty adequate to the consumption of fuel ; and for the greater
 certainty of attaining their object it was agreed that a coun
 ter should be attached to each engine*, and all the engines be
 put under the superintendance of some respectable and compe
 tent engineer, who should report monthly the following partisu-
 lars in columns : viz.
     The name of the mine ; the size of the working cylinder^
    * The counter is a train of wheels, working like clock-work,
                                                                     commonly
 attached to the beam in such a manner that every stroke made by the en
 gine moves one tooth, so that the index tells how many strokes have been
 made since last examined.      This is so shut up in a box that no person tail
 get at it but the one intrusted with the key.
                                                                      whether

whether working single or double ; the load per square inch in
cylinder ; length of stroke in the cylinder ; the number of pump
lifts ; the depth in fathoms of each lift ; diameter of pumps in
inches ; time worked ; consumption of coals, in bushels ; num
ber of strokes during the time ; length of stroke in pump ; load
in pounds ; pounds lifted one foot high by a bushel of coals ;
number of strokes per minute ; and lastly, a column for names
of engineers, and remarks.
      Messrs. Thomas and John Lean were appointed to the general
superintendance ; and the different proprietors,    as also the re
gular engineers of the respective mines, engaged to give them
every facility and assistance in their power.   Their first monthly
report was for August 1811, and included eight engines, which
had in that month consumed 23,661 bushels of coals, and lifted
 126,126,000 pounds of water one foot high, being an average
duty of 15,760,000 pounds lifted one foot high with each bushel
 of coals.    In the months of September and October the engines
 reported    were nine, and in November and December twelve ; and
 it now evidently appeared that the regular publication of Messrs.
 Leans' very useful Tables had already been attended by some
 improvements in the condition of the engines ; for the average
 duty for December 1811, extracted from these tables, appears
to have been 17,075,000 pounds.
      In January 1812 the number of engines reported was 14,
 and by the end of that year they were increased to 19; and the
  average duty performed by all the engines in the last-mentioned
  month had advanced to 18,200,000.
       In 1813 the number of engines included in the monthly re--
  ports continued to increase till in December they were 29, and
  the average   work 20,162,000.
       During some of the months of 1814 the engines reported
  were 32, and the average duty performed during December was
   19,784,000 pounds lifted one foot high with each bushel of coals.
       The Table which is subjoined is an abstract from- Messrs.
  Leans' Reports, and has been formed by first counting how many
  engines are reported, as in January 1815, 32 engines ; then
  adding up the column containing the quantity of coals consumed
  by all the engines during the month, and putting down the
   amount,! 10,824; in like manner adding up the column of pounds
   lifted by each engine one foot high by one bushel of coals, the
   amount of which was 637,320,990; and lastly, dividing the latter
   quantity by 32, the number of engines at work, to obtain the
   average duty performed, viz. 19,916,250 pounds.

                         Some Observations on Steam-Engines.                         119
     From the foregoing Table it apj)ears that the average duty of
the engines reported, exclusive of Woolf 's patent engine, is at
this time about 20 millions.
     We have purposely kept out Woolf 's patent engine *, because
one of the ends intended to be gained by the monthly report of
work actually done by the engines employed in the mines, par
ticularly in pumping, was to know the comparative merit of
Woolf 's engine with two cylinders when contrasted with the
steam-engines     in common use.       One of Mr. Woolf 's engines
has been lately erected at Wheal Vor mine, of 53 inches diame
 ter in the great cylinder (the smaller cylinder being about one-
 fifth of the contents of the great one) and nine-feet stroke.   Ac
 cording to Messrs. Leans' Report for May, the duty performed
 by the engine alluded to, was 49,980,882 pounds lifted one foot
 with every bushel of coals consumed ; and by letter we are in
 formed (for the printed Report has not yet reached us) that the
  duty performed by Woolf 's engine in the month of June was
  50,333,000,
     Thus it appears that the average duty of the Patent Engine
  for the months of May and June was fifty millions, while the
  aggregate average duty of the other engines is only twenty mil
  lions.   From this it is evident that Mr. Woolf 's improvements.
  on the steam-engine will be productive of much benefit to the
  mining interests of the kingdom. On some of the large mines
  when this engine shall have come into general use, which it must
  do sooner or later, the saving in fuel only, will add to the yearly
 dividends among the proprietors, several thousand pounds ster
 ling. Nor is this all : the expense that will thus be saved will
 prevent numbers of mines from stopping work ; and will be the
 means of setting many again to work which have ceased on ac
  count of the expense necessary to keep them free from water.
     Those of our readers who are not acquainted with the magni
  tude of some of the mining concerns in this kingdom, can form
  no adequate opinion of the importance of such a saving in the
  article of fuel, as is effected by Woolf 's engine.    They may,
  however, form spine idea of              it,
                                  when informed that the expense
  of one of the large mines for coals only, to work their engines,
  and keep the mine free from water,    about twenty-five thousand
                                                     is

XXV.    Specification of Mr. Arthur Woolf's latest Patent for
  certain Improvements in the Construction and Working of
  Steam- Engines.
    JL the said Arthur Woolf do hereby describe and ascertain the
nature of my said invention, and the manner in which the same
is to be performed, as follows ; that is to say : the working cylinder
of my said steam-engine has no bottom, but is inclosed in another
cylinder, of such dimensions that the space between the two (which
space I call the receiver) is equal to at least the contents of the
working cylinder. The inclosing cylinder has a bottom, and the
two cylinders are joined together at the top by flanches, or any
 other suitable means ; and the lower rim of the working cylin
 der is about as far distant from the bottom of the inclosing cy
linder as the distance between the sides of the two cylinders.
 (N. B. Though I have called the inclosing vessel a cylinder, it
 may be of any other figure fit to receive the working cylinder, as
 will be rendered sufficiently obvious by explaining my mode of
 working, which is as follows.)      Instead of having a void space
 for receiving steam below the piston, or whatever may be used
 instead of a piston, I introduce below it, and into the receiver,
 such a quantity of oil, fat of animals, wax, or any other substance
 not too volatile, and which may be kept fluid by such a tem
 perature as may conveniently be commanded, as shall, when the
 piston is at its greatest height in the working cylinder, fill all the
 space below    it, and also fill the receiver up to the height of a
 few inches above the lower rim of the working cylinder. Things
 being thus arranged,  if  the engine is to be worked   by the pressure
  of the atmosphere, the receiver has      a communication with the
  boiler. This communication being opened, steam             isadmitted
  into and fills the receiver above the oil, or other fluid body.     If
  the communication between the receiver and the boiler be now
  shut off, (by any of the means in common use, or           by
                                                              any other
  means,) and a communication         be opened from the receiver to
  the condenser, (previously exhausted     by the usual means,) a va
  cuum will be formed in the receiver, and then the pressure of
  the atmosphere, acting upon the piston, will cause      it to descend
  in the working cylinder, pushing the oil or other fluid body be
  fore it, and causing the fluid body to ascend into the receiver,
   after which the steam     again admitted for the next stroke.
                            is                                         If
  the engine, instead of being worked          by
                                               the pressure of the at
                                                             mosphere.

                 Some Olservations on Steam- Engines.                  121
mosphere, is to be worked by the action of steam upon the pis
ton, then the working cylinder must, as usual in steam-engines
so   worked,     be   furnished. with a cover.      In this case, whether
the engine is to be worked as a single or as a double engine, in
stead of the communications           usual in the engines in common
use,    viz. for the alternate    admission and condensation of steam
above and below the piston,           the communications of pay engine
are to the upper part of the working cylinder, and to the upper
part of the receiver ; the receiver in my engine answering to the
space below the piston in other steam-engines, so that when the
receiver is open to the condenser, and the upper part of the
 working cylinder open to the boiler, the piston descends, and
 vice versa.      It maybe proper to remark here, that though I have
 described my receiver as containing and surrounding the working
 cylinder, because I prefer this arrangement, yet the receiver may
 be a separate vessel connected with the working cylinder at the
 lower part.        It is also proper to remark, that to prevent waste
 of steam by unnecessary condensation, and to keep up the tem
 perature of the oil, or other fluid body employed, the receiver
 may be inclosed in a steam-case,            or heat may be applied to it
 externally.       Lastly,   whatever   arrangement or mode of working
 be adopted, there should always be some oil, or whatever other
 fluid body may be used, above tbe piston, to the height of a few
 inches, to prevent the passage of the atmospheric air or of the
 steain downwards by the side of the piston ; and as the quantity
 of oil, or other fluid body, above the piston, may deviate from a
 given height by the working of the engine, means must be pro
 vided to restore it to the requisite height, as cocks, valves, or
 any suitable contrivance, regulated by a float or floats upon the
 surface of the oil, or by means of a pump or pumps, worked by
  the engine itself, or otherwise.          By the interposition of the oil,
  or other fluid body, between the piston and the condenser as be
  fore described, all waste of steam, by passing the piston, is ef
  fectually prevented, and a consequent saving of fuel is effected.
      ''N'.B. As it is usual for the pistons of steam-engines to work
   in steam-vessels of a cylindric form, I have in the preceding de
  scription, for the sake of perspicuity, spoken only of the piston
   working in a cylinder ; but the piston may work in a four-sided
   or any other polygonal prismatic-formed vessel.
      "In witness whereof," &c.
       The   accompanying       sections   (Plate II)  which we have laid
    down from    Mr. Woolf 's Specification, will give those of our readers
    who may not be perfectly acquainted with steam-engines, a pretty
    correct idea of the arrangement and mode of working which he
                      -
    has  specified.

        122            On the Size best adapted        for Achromatic    Glasses.
         Fig. 1 . In this the inner cylinder represents the working cylinder
    filled with oil, or any other fluid body, (perhaps water might be
    found to answer) up to the piston, with a portion of the same
    fluid over the piston.       This cylinder having no bottom, the same
    fluid stands between it and the next cylinder (which Mr. Woolf
    calls his receiver) at a height proportioned to the distance of the
    piston frosi the top of its stroke.           The outer cylinder in this
    figure   shows   the steam-case.  —   This is his arrangement for working
    by the pressure of the atmosphere.             The steam being admitted
    only into the receiver, causes ihe oil or water to descend therein
     and rise into the working cylinder carrying the piston before it ;
    when (the communication           with the condenser being opened) a
    vacuum being formed, the oil or other fluid ascends in the re
    ceiver, and the piston then descends, when a fresh charge of
    steam is admitted, and the stroke of the engine repeated.
         Fig. 2 differs from fig. 1 only in having the receiver placed
    beside the working cylinder, instead of inclosing the latter. For
    our part, we prefer the first arrangement.
        When the engine is to be worked by steam upon the piston, in
    stead of the atmosphere, then the working cylinder as well as the
    receiver must be covered, and the working cylinder, like the re
    ceiver, must have a communication with the condenser.
        The advantage which Mr. Woolf s new improvement pro
    mises         the impossibility of any steam being wasted
                 is,                                                   passing by
    the piston — a source of more waste than                   is
                                                          generally imagined.

    distinctness      much easier obtained in

seven feet Newtonian has sufficient light with a single eye-glass,
which gives  it a magnifying power of 287, to show the belts and
double ring of Saturn completely well.       What can we wish for
more ?    How many have expended large sums of money on te
lescopes, without having ever seen such an all- repaying sight !
   Query: Can the acme of perfection be obtained in metals of
larger diameter ?   Several of our first-rate practical and working
opticians have candidly declared to me, they would not, for ge
neral sale, undertake to make speculums of larger size than nine
inches, that would show a star round and neatly : and unless thev
will bear this grand ordeal, it has been the fashion, latelv, to'
suppose its figure cannot be depended on for exhibiting any ob
ject with that faithful accuracy which is the sine qua non of
astronomical instruments.
     That distinctness of vision appearing to be so limited, mav
not create one sigh from the breast of any minute philosopher,
that further optical assistance cannot be giveu to his eve; and
that art      is,as I have before said, so circumscribed          ;   wiil ven
                                                                      I
ture to account for these impediments and boundaries from the
operations of Nature herself;        i.   e. the rapid rotatory motion of
 the earth preventing the application of a higher power than 300
times being used with any advantage.              This is   so true, that, un
til  this obstacle  is  removed, we need not hunt after monstrous
telescopes,     unless   itbe in the true hobby-horsical         spirit, fur the
 sake of  t lie pleasure arising from the trouble       of   using them, and
 being disappointed.         Beyond  a    certain  size,  telescopes are only
just as useful, as the enormous spectacles which are suspended
 over the doors     of opticians.
     When the inventors of the achromatic glasses fixed the powers
 of their telescopes,     it  was no doubt done after due deliberation,
 and  a  conviction arising from experiment, that for planetary uses
 the proportion of the pencil of rays to the diameter of the ob
 ject-glass was most proper when as forty to one,           i.  e. for common
 telescopes and common observers.               Thus the thirty-inch, with
 two inches aperture, magnifies eighty times; and                itmay be con
  sidered a   general  rule,  that  to find the   most   effective  magnifying
 pdwer of      a telescope for planetary use, multiply the diameter of
  the object-glass by-forty or fifty: to bear more          it must be a very-
  fine instrument, and the planet near the meridian          ;        by
                                                                     the proxi
  mity of the object to which, the application of magnifying power
  must always be governed.            When the pencil       is much less than
  one-fiftieth    of an   inch   diameter,  it   is too  diluted   to perfectly
  escite the action    of   the  eye: and,   when    applied to the planets,
   we lose in distinctness more than we gain,               by the magnifying
   being in too high     a  ratio to the illuminating power.             But we
   must take into the account not only the bigness but the bright-
      ^                                                                     ness

ness   of the pencil of rays, which will of course be in proportion
to the brilliance of the object observed.
    Some stars I have observed with a power which diminished
the diameter of the pencil to nearly one hundred-and-twentieth
of an inch ; t. e. a power of 420, with an aperture of three inches
and five-eighths diameter in the clear.       1 have never yet seen
any object that appeared to require a greater power; and it re
quires a most perfect telescope, and every other favourable cir
cumstance, to admit of this being used with any advantage. From
the rapidity of the diurnal motion of the earth, the limited ex
citability of the eye, the impediments to vision arising from our
magnifying the atmospheric medium we look through, in propor
tion as we magnify the object we look at, increase in so high a
ratio to the magnifying power, that more than 100 for terrestrial
 and 300 for astronomical use rather impede than assist vision.
And again, when we charge our telescopes with a higher power
than 300 times, what very uncommon dexterity is required either
to find the object, or manage the instrument ! It is indeed for
tunate that a higher magnifier is rarely needful, as it cannot be
used to much advantage till the atmosphere he removed, and the
earth stands till.
     With a good achromatic of forty-six inch focus, and a treble
 object-glass of three inches and five-eighths in the clear aper
 ture, 1 have seen that most minute point of light near the pole-
 star, with the following powers, measured by a dynameter in
 vented and made bv the late ingenious Mr. Ramsden : 40, 80,
 150, 250, 350, 420, 700; and even with 1123 times the small
 star was still visible.  Mr. William Walker, the astronomer, was
 observing with me, and also saw this.        Mr. Charles Fairbone,
 mathematical-instrument maker, of Great New-Street, Fetter-
 Lane, saw it again very distinctly on the 30th August 1807.
 Mr. Samuel Pierce, telescope-maker, at Mr. Berge's, optician,
 Piccadilly, observed the same on the 26th May 1811.         I believe
 the polar star is as proper as any, for a test of the perfection of
 a telescope, as to its light and distinctness ; and as it is easily
 found, and always visible, it is the more desirable, as it is a more
 universally attainable test.
     I mention the foregoing observations merely as an authenti
 cated and curious fact, how far magnifying power ?buld be car
 ried on this object, as it was with evident detriment to vision
 when higher than 80, which showed this star more pleasantly,
 and the illuminating and magnifying powers for this object ap
 peared to be in more perfect proportion than with any of the
 higher or the lower powers.
     We shoidd never use a greater magnifier than we absolutely
 want; the lower the power, the more beautiful and brilliant the
   . .                                                          object

object appears : the field       of view is proportionately large, and
uniformly good and distinct, and the motion of the objects passing
it proportionately less : thus they may be observed with greater
ease and quiet attention.         But here it may be well to observe,
there is no use in the pencil of rays being of larger diameter
than the optic pupil, which is commonly calculated at one-tenth
of an inch, varying in magnitude according to the brightness or
obscurity of the object presented to it.                The natural state ap
pears   to be  that  of  dilatation   ;   and   the   contraction, a state of
violence produced by an effort originating in the mind: when
the light is too strong, or the object too bright, we contract the
pupil to intercept that excess of light which would injure the
eye: when the light is faint, the pupil expands, that a greater
quantity of light may enter the eye, and thus make a stronger
impression upon it.        This contraction and dilatation of the pupil
may be observed by holding a looking-glass (or, what is still bet
ter, the lowest small speculum of a G gorian telescope) before
the eye at a window,       and turning grr/.ially from              it,
                                                                    continually
looking at the eye.         It  may     be  more    easily  and  perfectly seen
by   attentively watching     the   eye    cf another.         think
                                                               I           most
                                                                             it   is
agreeably observed in       a fine foil Mue eye.
   To ascertain the magnifying power of telescope, we measure
                                                  a                 if
the diameter of the aperture of the objoct-glass or speculum, and
that of the little image of       k     which    is formed at the end of the
eye-piece,     the  proportion     between      these    will give the ratio of
the magnifying power.           To measure the diameter of the pencil
of rays with great ease and accuracy, Mr. Ramsden about the
year 1775 contrived      a   clever little instrument, which he called
a  dynaineter; for though, when single lenses are used, the power
of   a glass  is  readily discovered       by  dividing the focal length of
the object-glass    by  that of the eye-glass,— in eye-pieces of the
common construction, especially those of a negative focus,
                                                                                       it
                                                                                       is
very difficult to measure in this manner          ;   nor can     be done with
                                                                   it
any accuracy with those eye-pieces which are made for erect
vision with four eye-glasses.
   The dynameter      is  principally composed of a fine micrometer
screw, and a divided plano-convex glass               ;   by
                                                           means of which the
 image of the pencil of rays      is completely separated, and the dia
meter of     it known to the greatest nicety.               The wheel or head
of  the micrometer     is  divided into a hundred equal parts, and                       &
figure engraven over every fifth division, which                     cut rather
                                                                        is

0  to each figure in calculating,      it   will then read off, 10, 20, 30,
 and so on to 200.        The nonius       is divided into 15, 10, towards
0,   and 5   on the contrary side.
    The revolutions of the micrometer head will bring the edge of
                                                                             the

                                                 is
 part of an inch.
    Applying this little instrument to the eye-glass of a telescope,
when adjusted to distinct vision at any distant ohject, and turn
 ing the micrometer head, the emergent pencil will begin to se
 parate   ;and when the extreme edges are brought into contact,
 the number of divisions will show the diameter of                      in thou    it
 sandths of an inch then reduce the diameter of the object-glass
                             ;
 into thousands, and divide that sum                  by
                                                   the diameter of the pen
 cil, the quotient will be the real magnifying power.               But as                   rt
                                                                                             is

«f   telescopes,  or microscopes, is measured by the proportion of
 the  diameter of the original pencil to that of the pencil which
 enters the eye.
    The degree in which magnifying power may be advantageously
 applied, depends so much on the perfection of the telescope and
 the state of the atmosphere,         that it is hardly possible, by any
 general rules,   to fix precise  limits to it : but, to afford an oppor
 tunity of trying this and many other entertaining           experiments',
 the day eye-piece should have a pipe-drawer ; and the screw,
 which receives the tube containing the two first glasses, should
be the same as the screw which fixes the eye-drawer to the tele
 scope : and the two first eye-glasses should be made to separate
 (by a sliding tube within the pipe-drawer) from the third aiu
 fourth.    This will give a very pleasing variety, and be extremely
convenient to those who wish to obtain a certain, exact degree o»
 magnifying power.
    For large adjustments, and also that the telescope may be
used for near objects, and occasionally           be made to supply the
place of a microscope, it should have a sliding tail-piece ; and
 the tcoth and pinion for the fine adjustment should be made
carefully, so as to move easily and smoothly, that it may not shake
the glass while adjusting it.         This is one of those defects we
must expect to find in instruments which are so very rarely used
by those who make them
                               — the workman not being aware of the
great importance of the telescope being perfectly steady during the
adjustment of the focus.         For this purpose, there should be two
steadying    sliding  tubes  applied from the eye-end of the telescope
to the stand.     . These  will  in great measure prevent the vibra
tions, which are such impediments to vision.             When the eye is
perfectly satisfied with the adjustment of the focus, let the tele
scope be so placed that the object may pass through the field,
the instrument remaining at rest during the time: this answers
better than running after it with rack-work.
    The telescope should be suspended in the centre of gravity,
and mounted on a portable and folding mahogany stand, with
divided circles, and an universal polar adjustment.              If the in
strument be then placed in the plane of the equator, only one
motion will be required to follow the object ; which, when large
magnifiers are Used, is a very great advantage, as the tremors
occasioned by the movement of the rack-work are of course pro -
portionably diminished.           And be it always remembered, that
steadiness is of the first importance.          When high magnifiers are
used,    we  need   every  assistance   that can  be contrived ; as, even
with the best constructed stands,          a person walking in the room
will prevent our seeing distinctly; nay, the very pulsation in the

  body of the observer will sometimes agitate the floor enough to
 produce this effect.
    The atmosphere always appears most diaphanous on those
 evenings when there is least wind; and vision seems better, per
 haps, because the instrument is still.       For this reason, and to
 avoid currents of air passing before the glass, whenever the
 weather will permit, let the telescope be taken out of doors ; for
 it will never do its utmost unless it is placed on the ground, in
 the open air.     If the instrument has been kept in a room, the
 temperature of which is much warmer than the open air, I usually
 take off the cap of the object end, and take out the eye-piece,
 and let the air pass through the tube for ten minutes ; and for
 at least the same space of time we must carefully avoid all sti
 mulating and bright objects; so that the pupil may be in its
 most expanded state.      When the eye is thus prepared, the sen
 sibility of the visual organ will be much increased.       I have also
 found it very advantageous to occasionally rest the eye for a few
 minutes: this will restore its irritability, which is soon exhausted
 when stimulated by an intensely bright object: and when a light
 is necessary to find an eye-piece, or rectify the instrument, to
prevent the adjustment of the eye being disturbed, I use a smaH
 lantern, which gives a very faint light only on one side, and that
 may be made dark.
    For those who have not courage, or constitution, to brave the
inclemency of midnight frosts and damps, the most steady way
 of supporting a telescope within doors, is by a clamp made to
fasten on the sashes when the top sash is put down : the object-
end of the telescope is then in the open air, and out of reach of
the undulating motion occasioned by looking through a medium
of atmosphere which is undergoing a change of temperature, by
the cold air rushing into the warm room.          By this contrivance
we have almost all the steadiness of being on the ground, with
out being exposed to the cold, &c.
    I must here endeavour to impress on the mind of my readers
another most important observation: when they have done using
the telescope, let the object-glass be taken out and laid in a dry
warm place, for a sufficient time to evaporate the damp air,
which on dewy evenings too plentifully condenses on the object-
glass ; and however closely the lenses constituting the object-
glass are burnished into the brass cell, unless they are very care
fully kept dry, the damp air will penetrate between the glasses,
and produce a sort of fog, or sometimes an arborescent vegeta
tion like sea-weed, which I have seen spread all over the object-
glass.    Unless- these evils exist in a very extreme degree, ex
perience has proved the only detriment they do to the perform
                                                                  ance

put up with an almost imperceptible diminution of its brilliancy,
than run the risk of destroying the telescope— for the object-
glasses cannot be separated from each other, without perhaps                      ir
reparably disordering the adjustment         from the perfect harmonv
                                                   ;
of which, the instrument may, possibly, in a great measure derive
its superior excellence, from certain circumstances, which oiice
disturbed can never be restored — the acme of perfection being
always accidental.
   Moreover,       itequally indispensable, when we wish to discern
                        is
those delicate and minute objects which are the most interesting
and curious exhibitions our telescopes display to us, and with the
finest instruments are only discernible with the most favourable
circumstances, that we should be in            position of the greatest
                                                   a
ease: no cra'mp or painful posture must distort the body, or                      ir
ritate the mind; the whole powers of which must be concentrated
in  the eye    for such
               :            the sympathy between the various organs
                                   is
of the human body, that we may as well attempt to think ac
curately on two subjects at the same time, as to use two senses
at the same moment: — each must be used alone.                As our im
mortal Shakespeare has observed of listening, with such profound
attention, that         "

XXVII. Memoir       on the Nature   of fat  Substances.   By Henry
    Braconnot, Professor of Natural History, and Director of
    the Garden of Plants at Nanci.
                        [Concluded  from p. 41.]
                Action  of the Nitric Acid    upon Suet.
M essrs.      Fourcroy, Alyon, and Vogel have already made some
experiments on the action of the nitric acid upon fat ; but these
chemists seem to have considered the results of this action only
as furnishing   a medicament, which has been called, with sufficient
impropriety, oxygenated pomatum         ; for, to speak the truth, this
fat contains suet approaching the state of adipocire, fixed oil
with nitric and acetic acids combined with these fat matters.
     Twenty grammes of beef suet were put into a retort, and there
were added 120 grammes of the nitric acid of commerce at 39'.
Tl\e reaction between these two substances was not so prompt
as might have been expected ; for the acid was in full ebullition
without any red vapours being extricated: at length the latter
appeared, and distillation was continued until almost the whole
of the acid had passed over: there was extricated but a small
quantity of azotic gas mixed with carbonic acid, and a volatile
oil which had the smell of coriunder.
     The suet thus altered and remaining at the bottom of the re
tort was melted several times in boiling water ; the water was
uniformly set apart: and we shall examine them presently.             In
 the mean time we direct our attention to the fatty substance
which refused to melt in boiling water ; this weighed 13 grammes,
 had an acrid styptic taste, partly owing to the nitric acid which
it still retained : it was much softer than the suet employed, and
 contained a quantity of fixed oil of a brown colour, very soluble
 in alcohol, besides a solid substance which was isolated from the
 oil by pressure in gray paper.      This concrete substance was dis
 solved in a small quantity of warm alcohol ; the mixture became
 hard on cooling; it was then pressed in gray paper, and a snow-
 white substance was obtained in fine needles of a pearly appear
 ance : it is inodorous, not very sapid, pulverulent, soft and unc
 tuous to the touch, precisely like spermaceti ; but it is infinitely
 more soluble in warm alcohol, which takes up such an immense
 quantity that the liquor runs into a solid mass upon cooling. If
 the solution be sufficiently diluted with alcohol, snowy-like flakes
 are precipitated, formed of a net-work of very fine needle-like
  crystals.   Ether and oil of turpentine also dissolve perfectly this
 substance, which crystallizes by the spontaneous evaporation of
  those solvents.    It does not experience any sensible alteration
                                                                   from

    from the acids.           When distilled it passes into the receiver with
    out changing its nature, and leaves but a slight charry residue
    in the retort.        It enters into fusion at the temperature of 54|°
    R. ; white wax in its state of purity melts at the same degree
    of heat, according to Bostock.               From the properties which we
    have recognised in this substance, we cannot mistake it for a
    distinct species of adipocire ; for it differs sensibly from that
    which we have obtained by the action of sulphuric acid upon
    suet, since the latter substance presents but a grainy crystalliza
    tion like bees'-wax, and which is besides a little more fusible.
          I now return to the waters which have served to wash the
    greasy matter proceeding from the distillation of the nitric acid
    on suet.        These waters, when collected, deposited a flaky white
    matter ; but as the liquor appeared still to retain a great deal
    in solution, doubtless in consequence of the nitric acid which
    existed in this liquor, it was evaporated to the consistence of
    honey, which became very solid upon cooling. This residue well
    washed with cold water, left nearly two grammes of a vyy white
    flaky and ,not very soluble powder; the water which had been
    used in the washing, kept in solution but a small quantity of
    yellow matter, but no trace of oxalic acid.             M. Vogel had like
    wise observed, that by boiling nitric acid with fat or with beef
    suet, a white powder was formed upon cooling.                M. Vogel con
    sidered     it as mucous acid ; but the properties which it presented
    to me do not permit me to adopt the conclusion of this respect
    able chemist.          This powder, as I obtained              an acid of
                                                                  it,   is                       a
    sourish taste, but  it      has not the granulated and crystallized aspect
    of mucous acid.           When exposed to heat,         melts like suet, and
                                                             it
    is    entirely  volatilized   on
                                   a     burning coal, giving out      white vaa
    pour.       When distilled    in   a   small retort, this acid passes into
     the receiver in the form of an oily liquid, which on cooling as
     sumes the consistence of wax, without however losing its acid
     taste and other properties.
        . Warm oil of olives dissolves this acid, and           part
                                                                   a     precipi     is
     tated upon cooling:     it   is   soluble in cold water but in small quan
     tities.     Warm water has a much stronger action over                   and         it
                                                                                           ;
     when  it is     boiling, we may obtain a solution which upon cooling
     goes into a white mass, in which we can distinguish no appear
     ances of crystallization.         This acid dissolved    water precipitates
                                                                  in

      flaky. white precipitate soluble in weak acetic acid:           forms also
      deposits in the nitrate of mercury and sulphate of iron. The
      latter is* of a reddish colour but
                                       ;        it does not produce any change
      in the     nitrate  of. silver, the   sulphate of manganese and the sul
      phate of copper, although            it  produces with oxide of copper                      a
-
      salt which   is   soluble but in a     moderate degree.

   -  When joined with ammonia, this acid yields a salt unalterable
  in the air, soft, fusible like suet, and easily soluble in water :
 this solution does not becomes frothy by agitation ; the nitrate
 of silver forms in it a magma like pitch, and which is coloured
 in the light. The sulphate of iron occasions a deposit which
 collects in clots like a fatty matter.
     This same acid combined with lime furnishes a soluble salt,
 the solution of which evaporated spontaneously leaves a very
 white, shining, opaque and enamel-like residue. This salt is-'
 sapid, and unalterable in the air.        With magnesia it gives a1'
 transparent combination, which leaves a coat of varnish on the
 vessels, from which we may detaeh it with the point of a knife :
 it  then resembles mica.
     To conclude: this salt is unalterable in the air, and soluble in
 water: we, know that the mucites of lime and magnesia are in-:
 soluble.    It forms with oxide of zinc a white salt tolerably so
 luble.   We see that this acid has by no means the characters of
 the mucous acid: it seems, on the contrary, to resemble closely
 the pyro-sebacic acid of M. Thenard.
             Action  of the weak Nitric Acid    upon Suet.
     Twenty grammes of nitric acid at 39", diluted with one-half
its weight of water, were put in ebullition for three quarters of
an hour with twenty grammes of beef suet : the latter was en- '
tirely decomposed, although but a small quantity of nitrous gas-
was extricated, mixed with azotic gas and carbonic acid : the
greasy matter when well washed in boiling water had not sensi
bly lost its weight ; but it was much softer than the suet em
ployed, and was of a slight yellowish colour.        This substance :
when heated with alcohol was dissolved in it with astonishing
promptitude ; the solution in cooling went into a white mass,
which when contained in a fine cloth was subjected to the ac- .
tion of the press: I obtained an alcoholic liquid, which left after.
its evaporation about five grammes of a vellowish oil very solu
ble in alcohol, in ether, and in the alkalies.      The solid matter
left in the cloth formed the greater part of the suet thus altered
by the nitric acid.     It was very white and pulverulent : but in
order to be very certain of obtaining it in all its purity, it was
treated with essence of turpentine and pressed between some
folds of gray paper : a substance was obtained analogous to white
wax, but much drier, falling into powder between the fingers,
and capable of waxing bodies.      When melted and cooled, it pre
sents a lamellated crystalline structure like certain kinds of adi^
pocire, but not in fine and pearly needles like those which we
have obtained by the action of a great quantity of nitric acid at
30° on the suet,                         -                           .<

   To conclude: This sebaceo-cirous substance, as well as all
those formed by the action of the acids and alkalies on suets, is
united instantaneously with the alkalies, and is dissolved with ex
cessive promptitude   in ether, in warm alcohol, and is precipi
tated from these solvents, sufficiently diluted, in the form of ge
latinous flakes, as wax will do.
                      Action   of the Muriatic Acid              on Suet.
   The muriatic acid has not exactly the same action on suet
with the sulphuric and nitric acids: neverthelesa it converts it
in part into an oil not very soluble in alcohol.   I boiled ten
grammes of muriatic acid with as much beef suet, until the lat
ter had aequired a fawn colour; when well washed in boiling
water and cooled it was of a soft consistence, owing to two
grammes and two decigrammes of oil formed during the reaction;
but a very small quantity of adipocire only was produced, and
the greater part of the suet remained without appearing to have
undergone any remarkable                  alteration.
                           Action   of the Alkalies          on Suet.
    We have seen that the acids, in acting on the suet, metamor
phose it into a substance very analogous to wax, and into oil
very soluble in alcohol. The action of the alkalies will offer to
us. nearly the same results.  Beef suet has been saponified by
potash ; this combination dissolved in a great quantity of water
did not deposit pearly matter such as has been described by
M. Chevreul. I poured into this soapy liqitor muriatic acid in
a slight excess, which separated from it the fat matter, which
when well washed in boiling water was kept in fusion during
some time, in order to vaporize the water which it retained in
jts molecules : when cooled, it was softer than the suet which
had served to produce      and contained nearly one-third of its

 strongly a quantity of ammonia, which the potash renders very
sensible.     The adipocirous matter which remained in the cloth
 after expression, was redissolved in warm alcohol: the mass,
 when cooled and again squeezed, was afterwards pres,*d in gray
paper, and we obtained a white adipocire greatly resembling
 those produced by the action of the acids on suet ; nevertheless,
 it seems to have a greasier aspect, since it can also be reduced to
 powder: it is also a little more fusible, since it enters into fusion
 at 50* R. Besides, it is dissolved with the same facility in alco
 hol, ether, and the alkalies; which we do not observe in most of
 the fats, if it be not the adipocire of dead bodies.
     When combined with potash it produces a very hard soap,
 which when diluted in water does not form a thick mucilage
 like that which results from the union of the oily matter of the
 soap of suet with potash.         With ammonia it furnishes a soapy
 emulsion,   which   is precipitated in large flakes by an excess of
 ammonia, probably because the water has more affinity with
 this alkali than with this ammoniacal soap : nevertheless, the
 latter appeared to me to form a more permanent solution with
 water than the ammoniacal soap with the basis of adipocire,
proceeding from the alteration of the suet by the acids.           We
 see that all those adipocirous substances, whether they have been
formed by the action of the acids or the alkalies upon suets,
differ among themselves by shades so slight that we may safely
consider them as so many varieties of one and the same species.
                   miction of Potash  .on Spermaceti.
    This substance, which we may regard as a species of erystalli-
zable suet, appeared to me to have less aptitude to saponify than
the other suets, which require in general a long interval of time-
In the soap of potash and of spermaceti, this last substance has
absolutely lost all its characteristic properties ; it does not cry
stallize any longer, becomes infinitely more soluble in alcohol,
ether, and the alkalies, and partakes precisely of all the properties
of the adipocire formed by the action of the alkalies on the suets.
But what appears to me very singular is, that the spermaceti
did not undergo the same metamorphosis from the application of
the concentrated sulphuric acid, which appeared to have little
action upon it.

    Twenty-five grammes of white soap of oil of olives, as sold in
the shops, and of a good consistence, were cut into thin slips,
and exposed to the heat of a sand-bath for several days, until it
became very dry and brittle.         It lost by this desiccation five
grammes     34 centigrammes of water. It was dissolved in boiling

  water, and muriatic acid was poured into it in slight excess,
  shaking well the whole ; there was separated a greasy matter
  which became fixed upon cooling, and which was much firmer
  than olive oil fixed at the same temperature.        This greasy mat
  ter well washed and melted weighed 17 grammes one deci
  gramme.         The liquor from which it had been separated gave
  by evaporation four grammes of muriate of soda, made red hot,
  which represents, according to Kirwan's valuation (and which
  appears exact), two grammes 56 centigrammes of soda, which was
  in combination in the 25 grammes of soap employed.
       The 17 grammes one decigramme of greasy matter were
  pressed for twenty-four hours, at the temperature of -|-40R., be
  tween several folds of gray paper, which absorbed the yellowish
  oily matter, very soluble in alcohol, ether, and the alkalies, and
  left two grammes three decigrammes of pure white adipocire:
  nevertheless, it was dissolved in a small quantity of hot alcohol,
  and the liquor was passed through a filter : on cooling it was eon-
  creted into a solid white mass, which was pressed in gray paper,
  and which was melted.          This substance greatly resembles white
  wax : it has the external appearance, the granulated fracture,
  and the semi-transparency ; but its consistency is drier, for it is
  reduced into a white powder between the fingers rather than
  melj ; nevertheless, it may be cut, presenting in its section
  shining surfaces as in common wax, and like the latter it can
l
  wax bodies ; but it is a little less fusible, and melts precisely at
  503 R. like the adipocire obtained by the action of potash on
  beef suet. To conclude : this adipocire of soap strongly resembles
  all those of which we have spoken formerly, and like them it is
  dissolved with the greatest facility irr alcohol, ether, and the al
   kalies.
      It results from this analysis that 100 parts of white soap of

  Now that   we     have examined the results of the action of the
acids and the alkalies on a fat substance, the nature of which is
homogeneous,     it is easy to conjecture what passes in saponifica-:
tion in general.     When we make an acid or an alkali act on suet,
the three principles which constitute         it,
                                        viz. hydrogen, oxygen,
and carbon, which were in a state of equilibrium, are separated
and combined in another order to form adipocire, and an oil very
soluble in alcohol. These two materials are indispensable to
the making of soap of good quality   for  ;    to be noted, that
                                                    it   is
when the fixed oils do not contain suet in a sensible degree, they
cannot produce adipocire during their saponification,     and for
this reason they only furnish soft soaps, lihe those which we ob
tain with pure olive or other vegetable oils, and even with fish
oil; but by adding to them a certain quantity of suet, they pro
duce solid soaps.
   We may also infer from the foregoing, that most of the oils
and suets    are not susceptible of uniting immediately with the
alkalies, since  this union cannot be effected but               by
                                                             change ofa
equilibrium in the elements of tallow or suet or of oil, which be
sides requiresa   prolonged ebullition during       considerable time,

and speedy method we could dispose the fatty substance to unite
immediately with the alkalies        hitherto have found only the
                                     ;              1
concentrated sulphuric acid which can attain this object                  :   it   is
sufficient to pour this acid into oil or melted tallow to dispose
them to unite immediately with the alkalies and form a perfect
soap on the instant: this mode appears to me so much the more
profitable, that the last portions of alkalies, even those which are
combined with the carbonic acid, may enter into combination
with the fat matter    ;   which    far from being the case
                                    is                              the   in
common preparation of soap, since the water which passes off
still contains alkali, which will not act upon fat.
                               Of   Rancidity.
  The results of the rancidity of fat had not yet been well ap
preciated, since all chemists have admitted that an acid was
                                                       formed:

   138         Memoir on the Nature     of fat  Substances.
  formed ; but this fact has been called in question by Messrs.
  Thenard and Parmentier, and the latter throught that oxygen
  in combining with fat was the agent of its rancidity.      This opi
  nion did not appear to me to be supported by irrefragable ex
  periments: we see that in the course of time fat undergoes
  nearly the same alteration with that which the acids and alkalies
  introduce, t. e. that it tends insensibly to approach the state of
  adipocire.
      Some mutton suet, as it is employed in the manufacture of
  candles, had been left for five years in an open vessel, and at a
  mild temperature ; its surface had acquired a yellow colour, but
  the interior of the mass was of a shining white, and of a. very
 rancid taste and smell.        This suet, when slightly melted and
  rubbed upon a paper coloured blue by turnsole, reddened it in
 stantly: an acid therefore was formed.       In order to separate the
 latter as well as the odorous principle which the rancid suet seemed
 to contain, it was boiled for some time with water in a retort,
 and I obtained by distillation a product of a very pungent and
 disagreeable smell of rancid grease, owing probably to the pre
 sence of a very expansible volatile oil ; this same product red
 dened turnsole tincture, and consequently contained a volatile
 acid which exhibited to me the characters of acetic acid.         The
 water remaining in the retort, and separated from the greasy
 matter, furnished by its evaporation a slight yellowish acid re
 sidue, transparent like a gum, and attracting humidity a little.
 This residue, which had a very strong taste of rancid grease, dis
 solves in water and in alcohol ; although strongly dried, it still
 reddened blue paper : its aqueous solution was precipitated by
 the acetate of lead.       The infusion of gall-nuts disturbed its
transparency,    and  in a  few minutes slight flakes were collected.
     This residue was therefore formed of an annualized matter,
 (perhaps a foreign substance,) and of a fixed acid in a propor
tion in too small a quantity to be examined.
     1 returned to the greasy matter     proceeding from the rancid
suet boiled in water: — it had entirely lost its rancidity.    Boiling
in water is therefore a very good way of taking from fat that
part which has become rancid, since the latter consists of sub
stances soluble in water, and of a volatile rancid principle.
Demachy had already advised the use of alcohol to take off the
rancidity of fat, but boiling water answers the purpose equally
well.
      Rancid tallow after being boiled in water seemed to me to
be of a firmer consistence than recent tallow, from which it dif
fers, besides, in most of its properties : in fact, it is more soluble
in alcohol ; but it is above all, the action of the alkalies on this
tallow thus changed, which is remarkable: they unite with it
                                                                almost

                     An Investigation offlexible         Substances.         139
almost instantly  to form a perfect soap ; if we repeat the same
experiment by treating in a similar way, and in the same space
of time, any recent tallow with an alkali, scarcely shall we be
able to produce any perceptible traces of soap.
   If we do not succeed in bringing a rancid fat back to its pri
mitive state, we may at least retard its rancidity : a slight alka
line solution seems to enjoy this property: hei.ce the practice
in certain countries of keeping fresh water in cloths moistened
with a lixivium.
  The disposition of the rancid fats to be saponified in a few
minutes, might perhaps present some useful results for soap-
makers : it also shows the profound alteration which they have
undergone, and the different degrees by which they become
adipocire — time alone can operate this change, as Fourcroy
proved in his examination of the churchyard of the Innocents.
This chemist also ascertained that fat persons furnished more
adipocire than lean, and that the marrow of the long bones was
converted wholly into adipocire.

from the failure of the hoops of a vat of great size, has led to an
inquiry respecting the strength required in structures of this
kind: and its results are comprehended in the following propo
sitions.   It must be remembered that they are only correctlv true
upon the supposition that the resisting points are absolutely fixed,
and that in actual practice the forces will be somewhat        more
equally  divided:  it would, however,  be always  prudent  to make
the strength great enough for the most unfavourable supposition
that can be made respecting its employment.

tended step by step to a greater number of points ; but as the
number increases, the inequality of the distribution between the
neighbouring points must of course diminish, and if it became        '
infinite, the pressure on each would be simply as the depth.

The Pharmacopoeia      of the Royal College of Physicians of Lon
    don,  1809; translated into' English, with Notes, &c. Third
    Edition.    By Richard Powell, M.D. Fellow of the Col
    lege, Physician to St. Bartholomew's and the Magdalen
    Hospitals, &c.     8vo.    London 1815. Longman and Co.
Our      readers have been from time to time apprised         that   the
learned and indefatigable translator of the London Pharmacopoeia
was busily employed in collecting materials for an improved and
enlarged edition of that valuable work.        In a modest and well-
written preface, Dr. Powell thus describes the various objects
which it was his study to attain : —
    " Since the publication of the last edition of the London Phar
macopoeia, various objections have been published to its general
principles as well as to its processes.      These, whatever be the
language in which they are expressed, whatever the motives by
which they are in many instances dictated, deserved at least a
calm consideration of their subject matter, and even the adoption
of such parts thereof as appeared to be necessary and useful.
Under this impression a committee of the college went through
the Pharmacopoeia, and have made those alterations therein
which have by them been judged to be requisite, and which,
having received the sanction of the college, are now published.
    " It will be seen that the alterations adopted refer, first to some
important processes, to which reasonable objections have cer
tainly been urged, on the score eitiier of manipulation or of pro
duct, as, for instance, in the preparation of Arftimoniun}, tar-
tarizatum, which, though it answered repeatedly according to the
former process, Upon a small scale, before the committee, has
 certainly faiied upon a large one, and under other circumstances :
secondly,    to some changes in the names of substances, as in
 giving up that principle (which was before considered to be suffi
 ciently distinctive) by which sub and super were only employed
 where both the salts were used pharmaeeutically for the purpose
 of distinguishing between them, without regarding the actual re-

lation of their constituent parts ; so that the salt which was at
first named carbonate of ammonia is now named, as it really is»
a snbcarbouate : thirdly, to the introduction of new articles,
which have been .sparingly adopted: fourthly, to the restoration
of some which had stood in the Pharmacopoeia of 1787 and been
omitted: and lastly, in a very few omissions from the last edition.
 Although these alterations have been made after a. mature and
 impartial deliberation, there probably will be many persons to
 whose ideas they may be neither sufficient nor satisfactory, and
 who will have sufficient confidence in their own opinion to hold
 it as matter of faith, that no other can be right or deserve to be
 adopted.
     " A Pharmacopoeia is in its very nature ephemeral, and requires
 certain changes after intervals of no very long duration ; nor
  should there exist in a well-educated profession, such as that of
 medicine in all its branches ought to be, any difficulty in receiving
  and adopting the alterations which are thought necessary.          It
 seems not improbable but that circumstances will again demand
  such a revision at no distant date.      Parliament are now em
 ployed in the consideration of the standard weights and measures
 of the kingdom ; and if those alterations which are expected
  therein shall be established by law, it will be for the college to
  consider whether they will claim any peculiar exemption for
  the compounder of medicines, or will not rather promote and
  assist in the general adoption of one uniform standard, to which
 there can be no other objection than the ideal difficulty of its
 first introduction. Whenever too that period shall arrive, I most
 sincerely hope that an increase of intercourse and of mutual re
 spect and good-will between the constituted authorities in medi
 cine in the different parts of the British empire will have laid a
 foundation for the establishment of one national Pharmacopoeia,
 which I am daily more and more convinced will be a measure of
 the utmost importance to the public good, and remove the evil*
 which exist in the shops from the incorporation of the three.
     " After thus speaking of the original work of the college, it is
 necessary for me to add a few words respecting the: translation,
 which in the first instance cost me no small time and trouble,
 and which I have in the present edition endeavoured to correct
 and improve, measuring however my notions of the necessity ef
 either, not by the abuse of others, but by my own judgement.
 I will repress as much as I can the impulse which I feel to en
 large upon this subject, and will in this respect accede to the
judgement of my friends.
    "  I could, in undertaking the translation originally, look to no
 praise beyond that of having collected together useful information
upon an important subject, and of having endeavoured to render
                                                                      it

                           Notices respecting New Books.                    147
  it correct.       My object did not preclude on the one hand, nor
. on the other did it demand, originality: if this had been neces
  sary, my engagements and occupations would have rendered it
  impossible for me to have undertaken the work. But still so much
  of the added matter has been repeated and adopted by others,
  whether with or without acknowledgement is of no consequence,
  that I can infer therefrom, with tolerable safety, that my labours
  have been of some utility in the judgement of others.
      " It is unnecessary to repeat what 1 have stated in the former
  preface, that for any chemical facts beyond the mere processes
  I have chiefly referred to Thomson's Elements of Chemistry,
  which in my own estimation is the best ; and it is more particu
  larly valuable on account of its reference to the original authorities
  upon whom its statements ultimately rest; and it would be
  childish to complain of that common trick which omits any state
  ments, as if they had not been made, when they happen to mi
  litate against the purpose of an objector.
       " I hope I shall preserve as long as I live the power as well as
   the will to resist personal attacks, and to defend and protect my
   own character ; but I see no reason why I should formally enter
   the lists with every one who chooses to assail me from a dark
   corner as I pass, or why like Erasmus I should hold myself com
   pelled S-tiqiopofxiiv* .      As I wish, on this and every other occa
   sion, like hi in to go on my road peaceably, it has certainly been
   matter of regret to me that 1 have been attacked with a viru
   lence beyond even that of sectarian controversy, though, thank
   God, I have not been, and I hope never shall be, proveked by it
   to a contest, in which victory itself must be disgraceful.
          The present edition of the translation of course includes the
   alterations made in the original ; and all the processes therein
   which have undergone any change, or are restored from the
    Pharmacopoeia of 1787, are marked thus, f.
       " I see my own error in attempting to mark the pronuncia
    tion of words with which prosody has so little to do by the pro-
    sodial characters, and have therefore employed the method of
    accentuation used by Dr. Young (Medical Literature 1813), and
    which is not subject to the same objections, instead of them.
       " To the botanical generic and specific names I have sub
    joined the svnonyms of the parts of the plants used in the French,
     German, and Spanish languages, as far as, with only a very im
     perfect knowledge of either, I could glean them from Dr. Swe-
    diaur's Materia Medica (Paris, An. 8.) because, under the pro

-such a reference might be occasionally useful in the shops, and
that its defects might easily be pardoned, and hereafter removed
by thosa. of our professional brethren who are better acquainted
with the application of these substances in the countries refer
red to.
    " The table of doses has been revised, but not much altered.
 I stated its necessary imperfections in the former preface, which
 I shall not again repeat; but I beg leave to offer my opinion that
doses can be ascertained by experience alone, and that nothing
 can be more fallacious than to infer those of compound substances
 from those of their constituent parts.      I have had some little
 experience upon this subject, and 1 believe the table to be as
correct, practically, as the nature of the subject will admit.
Many of the articles, it is true, will allow of increase with per
fect safety beyond the limits which are here assigned, especially
when they are intended to produce some particular definite ef
fects; and upon the whole, general practice may be thought, in
fact, and perhaps wisely, to keep itself below the standard rather
than exceed it ; and my chief object has been not to lead the
young practitioner into error by what 1 have stated.
   " I have allowed the preface to the first edition to remain un
altered in the present one ; and the only principle stated therein,
which is now superseded, I have marked by inverted commas.
   ** I find that some errata
                                exist, particularly in the accents,
which easily shift, even after they have once been right; any
others which have struck my eye on revision I have put together
in a table, and if more exist I shall be glad to have the;n pointed
out, and to remove them hereafter.
   "  I deem it also of importance here, to recommend to the
apothecary a most useful, and indeed necessary, new instrument
for the purposes of his profession ; I mean Dr. Wollaston's Seale
of Chemical Equivalents, described in the Philosophical Trans
actions.
   "   In acknowledging   with unfeigned gratitude   a variety   of com
  munications which I have received respecting the present work,
  I cannot but particularize the aid of Mr. Hume, chemist, of
  Long Acre, to whose practical skill the committee had repeated
  occasions to express their obligation.     Indeed, I am not con
  scious that in any instance I have purloined the observations-
  of others, or used them without due acknowledgement : if I have,
  it has not been wilfully done; nor need it have been mentioned,

  result of the whole,
                     I   may fairly reflect hereafter within my own
  mind, that it   has been my lot, in any degree, to contribute to
   the promotion of a profession of so much importance to man
                                                                   kindj

         We are far from expecting perfection in the early editions of a
    work comprehending such an immense variety of chemical and
     pharmaceutical preparations.       That there is however a still nearer
    approximation to this desirable requisite in the third edition of
    the Pharmacopoeia now before us^ a slight perusal will convince
    every candid reader.       In his praiseworthy labours Dr. Powell
    has judiciously availed himself of the assistance of the best prac
    tical chemists of the metropolis ; among whom lie has occasion
    more than once to particularize an old and zealous contributor
    to the Philosophical Magazine, Mr. Hume of Long Acre. The
    very scientific and delicate process for preparing " Anlimonitim
    tartarizatum," as communicated by that gentleman in a pre
    ceding number of this Journal, is embodied into the present edi
    tion of the work of the College, with a few modifications.         How
    far these changes may or may not benefit the preparation, we
    are not from actual experience qualified to decide : of this we
  . are certain, however, that Mr. Hume's process, as described in.
    this Journal, and above alluded to, has since been adopted, and with
    the most complete success, by almost every practitioner in phar
    macy in the metropolis.      In such a very delicate process, there
    fore, and of the result of which practical chemists are alone best
    qualified to judge, deviations from their formulae ought to be
    tautiously introduced.
        Before concluding, we ought to add that the present edition
    has to boast of a very valuable Appendix, containing every re
    quisite table respecting weights and measures, proportion of doses,
    &c. ; without an intimate and familiar acquaintance with which,
    no practitioner in medicine or pharmacy can answer for the con
    sequences of his prescriptions.
        Mr. Accum has in the     press a second edition [stereotype] of
    his  Practical Treatise on Gas Light ; exhibiting a summary de
    scription of the apparatus and machinery best calculated for il
    luminating streets, houses, and manufactories, with coal gas ;
:   with remarks on the utility, safety and general nature of this new
    branch of civil oeconomy.      Illustrated with seven coloured plates,
    showing the construction of the large machinery employed for
     illuminating the streets and houses of this metropolis, as well as
     the smaller apparatus employed by manufacturers       and private in

 received very general credit — that when Mr. Bramah applied to
 Parliament   for an extension of the term of his patent, jwo gen

 to the committee that Mr. Bramah 's lock might be picked with
 a piece of wood and a quill.     Prefixed to this edition is an ex
 tract from the Minutes taken before the committee. - Mr. George
 Hawks being asked, "When you made that key of wood, had
 you not the real key in your possession, from which you copied
 it ?" replied " Yes." — " Does the witness mean to say that he
 could make that key of wood, in such a manner as to open the
 lock, without having the real key to copy from ?" — " I don't
 mean to say so." — Mr. Henry Downer, cross-examined — "Had

 In    our report of the proceedings of this learned body for . May
'last, wc briefly alluded to a paper by Sir H. Davy, On a Com
  pound of Oxygen and Chlorine.              This compound, we now find,
  consists  of   two parts   in volume  of  oxygen and one part in volume
  of chlorine.       It is a permanent gas, very soluble in water, of a
  bright yellow colour, detonates, and is resolved into its two
  constituent parts by the heat of boiling water.              It has not acid
  properties   ;  from   which   it may  be  concluded    that  the acid pro
  perties  of  the   hvper-oxvgenized     muriatic  acid   are owing to com
  bined hydrogen.          According  to  the doctrine   of  definite propor
  tions, this new gas may be regarded as composed of one pro--
  portion of chlorine, and four proportions of oxygen.
    M. Sernentini, Professor of Chemistry at Naples, stated in a
 recent Italian journal, that         " the        of curcuma,
                                              yellow   tincture

                                                           the
same change by the action of the phosphoric acid."    M. Guy-
ton Morveau thus controverts this conclusion in the Annates de
 Chimie: — " The author of this observation must have been led
into an error by some accident.  A phosphoric acid which red
dened strongly even the blue paper in which sugar loaves are

      Calculus found in a Tumour in the left Hypochondria.                15   1
wrapped, had no more effect than distilled water on paper co
loured by curcuma.       How could M. Sementini bring himself to
publish this observation before having repeated the experiment,
and taken all means of ascertaining the purity of the substances
which he employed, or rather to reproduce the accidental com
position which had produced the phaenomenon ?
     "Ifit be true, as the illustrious Bergman observes, that Na
ture never conducts more securely to discoveries than when she
presents us with facts which are in complete opposition     to our
opinions, it is not by precipitate judgements founded upon slight
observations that truths are demonstrated."
  DESCRIPTION     OF A CALCULUS FOUND   IN           A TUMOUR       IN THE
                        LEFT HYPOCHONDRIA.
     M. Penada, an Italian surgeon, has published in the Memoirs
of the Italian Society of Sciences the following : — " The calculus
existed in a female fifty years of age, and came out through an
ulcer which was formed in the tumour.             It was precisely of the
shape    of a  hen's  egg:   the  colour  was  dark  gray, and its surface
granulated    and  shagreened.        On  removing the external coating,
the calculus presented a lamellated structure antj a bright yellow
colour: its consistency was compact, but not very hard ; and it
weighed in all one ounce two drachms.             When thrown into wa
                      it,
ter before opening    it       floated for  a few seconds, and theu fell
to the bottom of the liquid, giving out some air bubbles.
   ." It  was cut into two parts parallel to its axis       :   interiorly   it
presented from ten to twelve concentric layers, which decreased
gradually in thickness, analogous to walnut-tree wood.                These
layers were separated     by    a black streak around  a   circle of deep
                                                                      a
yellow, which diminished in breadth as          itapproached the centre,
and the surface of which was as brilliant as marble or highly
polished wood.        In the centre of these ellipses  a   perfectly sphe
rical body was remarked, of a fine white, formed of             a substance
less compact than the rest of the calculus; of         a  crystalline scaly
texture, and having nearly the form and consistence of the cry
 stalline of a   bull's-eye coagulated      by  heat.   This nucleus was
surrounded by     a     black circle more deeply coloured than the
ellipses just mentioned."
    On the chemical analysis of this calculus, Professor Melandri
of Padua obtained the following results
    " The central substance, or white nucleus, was entirely soluble
                                                :
in  ether, crystallizable and combustible       ; when thrown upon red-
 hot coals,  it   emitted the smell of incense.         The cortical part
 was onlv partially soluble.   in   alcohol and ether. The soluble part
 crystallized, and burned with      a   white flame and    a smell of wax.
 The   insoluble part burned     with  the  smell of animal   matter. Pro-

fessor Marabelli concludes from these experiments, that the cal
culus was formed entirely of adipocire modified by a resinous
principle, and the cortical part of adipocire very pure, and of an
animal substance."
    We have been favoured with a continuation of the valuable
 correspondence of our scientific friend M. Van Mons, of Brus
 sels, from which we present the following extracts:
    " M. Dobereiner of Jena, the same gentleman who metallized
 carbon, has succeeded in seizing upon hydrogen in the metallic
 form.    He galvanizes water put in contact with mercury, and
 obtains at the positive pole oxygen ; and at the negative pole
 where the mercury is placed, instead of hydrogen he obtains an
 amalgam consisting of this metal.        We may knead this amal
 gam and make it take different forms without its being decom
 posed ; but when exposed to heat it gives ofF the hydrogen, and
 the mercury once more becomes fluid.          M. Dobereiner thinlys
 that hydrogen gas     is a metal dissolved  in caloric.   His experi
 ment is very curious, and deserves to he repeated.
    " M. Dobereiner has also had indications of metallization in
 phosphorus.     He burns it under a bell-glass, and directs over it
 a ray of light direct from the sun.      The phosphorus is formed
 in pellets of a gold colour, and with great metallic lustre.    Sub-
 hydrogenated sulphur exhibited a blue substance similar to ultra
 marine.     M. Dobereiner considers all the substances hitherto
 undecomposed, as metals.
    " Since my last, I have obtained hydrargyrio-chlore at two dif
 ferent degrees of saturation, and even the one with the double of
 metal of the other.     The most saturated is black, the least satu
 rated is red. These are true oxidule and oxide of mercury by the
 dry muriatic acid, instead of being so by oxygen.      Sweet mercury
 furnished me the first compound, and corrosive sublimate the se
 cond. I increased the fire during the sublimation of the mixture
 of corrosive sublimate and quicksilver in one phial, and sweet mer
 cury ready prepared, but incompletely sublimed, in the other
 phial. The latter gave the black powder, and the other the
 red.     Some reduced mercury was separated in the first phial,
 and oxygen must have been extricated from both, because me
 tallic mercury was combined with the dry acid. When heated
 in oxygen gas, the one compound was converted into sweet
 mercury,    and the other into corrosive sublimate.          Chlorine
 neither acts upon the one nor the other when it is dry ; but
 with the addition of water it takes the mercury from them,
 the dry acid combining with water ; unless we mean to say that
 the oxygen of the chlorine passes to the metal, and that its dry
 acid is taken up by the water under the pile, and in the actual
                                                               decoin-;

decomposition of water the two compounds are resolved into
chlorine, which proceeds towards the positive pole, and into
reduced mercury,      which conjointly with hydrogen proceeds to
the negative pole.     Water in steam directed on the compounds
very much heated, takes from them the dry acid, and the mer
cury remains reduced. This effect is much more easily produced
on the red hydrargyrio-chlore than on the black.
    " I know not how far the announcement of Mr. Accum is well
founded* with respect to the metallization of charcoal; but in
the correspondence of the author of this discovery (M. Dobe-
reiner) with me, nothing of the kind is mentioned.          I may not,
however, have received all his letters, owing to the war.           His
colleague, Professor Kieser, with his pupils, like the rest of the
members of all the German colleges, is with the allied armies.
    " M. Dobereiner had already resolved silex in a great mea
sure into carbonic acid ; and some carbon proceeding from it
was sent, but it never reached me.          According to Mr. Accum's
information, M. Dobereiner must have operated by the phos-
phuret of iron and liquid alkali, which must have produced phos-
phuretted hydrogen gas, whereby the carbon will be hydro-
genated, and at the same time reduced, if this combustible does
not exist already without oxygen in carburetted iron. The car
 bon is reduced in the alcohol of Lampadius, which by water is
regenerated into sulphur and into carbon, and requires for its
 acidification more oxygen than its elements separated; and the
 sulphur is more or less reduced in the sulphuro-phosphorus,          as
is proved by the water collected during the formation.          A deto
 nation takes place, and hydrogen is disengaged."

    Sir, — Iv   your Magazine for May, page 387, I am requested
by Mr. John Farey sen. to explain a mistake, or otherwise throw
some light on my extraordinary account of rain upon Blackstone
 Edge in the nine months observation of 1813, as inserted in one
of your former Numbers.        The extraordinary notation of 86,08a
inches is certainly an error. My friend Mr. Leadbetter (the gen
 tleman who notes the fall of rain upon Blackstone Edge) and I are
 convinced that the error arose from the rain, which was driven
 against the outside of the funnel, getting access to the vessel under
 neath ; but which since January 1814 has been effectually pre
 vented by a very simple contrivance.        On the outside of the rain-
 funrtel (which is made of copper, and surmounted with a cy
 lindrical rim two inches broad and six inches diameter,) is sol
 dered, about the middle of the conical part, another piece of
                           * See vol.xlv.

      conical copper having its greatest diameter downwards : of
      course it will form an inclined shed ; so that, if the rain should
      trickle down the outside, it will be prevented from entering the
      bottle. We could not at first account for so great a difference
      between the two places of observation, till I suggested the pro
      bability of the rain entering from the above cause.

         Sir, — As every fact relative .to the subject of meteoric
      stones, — now that the existence of such stones is no longer
     s matter of doubt either among philosophers or the vulgar,—
      is entitled to attention     ; and as some of the most interesting
      observations on this subject are contained in different Numbers
      of your valuable Philosophical Magazine ; I hope that you will
     not deem the following observation unworthy of republication.
      I give jt to you entire in the words of the author, Michael Bem-
     hard Valentin, from the Epliemerides               Naturce Curiosorum,

      It is to be regretted that Valentin has not given us some
  more minute information concerning the size and form of the
  crystal, the exact season of the year in which- it fell, &c. These
  are points of some importance, and should Have been attended to.
  But notwithstanding those omissions, the general truth of the
  fact ought not, perhaps, to be called- in question : and, at any
  rate, the falling of a solitary rock-crystal from the clouds, or
  even a whole shower of such stones, are circumstances not more
  improbable than the falling of masses of iron, of nickel, and other
   metallic and similar substances. And who knows, as we live in the
  days of bold and ingenious speculations, but that some naturalist
   may step forward, and endeavour to prove that millions of those
.
   beautiful hexagonal and other siliceous crystals, which are so
  abundantly distributed upon, and immediately under, the surface
   of the earth, in North America and in other countries, have had
   similar, or meteoric, origin ?

    A phaenomenon of this description,       which was witnessed in
 November last, is thus       described by a native  philosopher:                    "A
 singular phaenomenon has occurred in the Doab ; 1 have heard
 the facts related by various persons, who all concur in the same
 account; the circumstances are as follow: On the 5th of No
 vember 1814, being Saturday, while half a watch of the day still
 remained    (i. e. half past four P. M.) there was first of all heard
a  dreadful peal of thunder, and then stones rained down in sight
 of the inhabitants of the country, each stone being 13 to 15
 seer* in weight. In the first place, wheresoever they fell        great
 dust rose from the ground; and after the dust subsided,                       a a

  XXXI. Account of          some   Electrical Experiments     by   M. De
     Nelis, of Ma/ines in      the Netherlands: with an Extension of
     them.     By George John Singer, and Andrew Crosse,
     Esqrs.     Communicated by Mr. Singer.
  During      the last   fifteen years, M. De Nelis has devoted con
 siderable attention    to the subject of electricity, which he states
 he was led to study in consequence of a thunder            storm, which
 accidentally    struck   his  house   whilst his   family were  assembled
 round a table in the dining parlour.
     The experiments he has made are very numerous, and prer.ent
 some facts of an interesting nature. The present account of them
 is selected in part from his recent communications        to Mr. Tilloch,
 and partly from his correspondence with M. De la Metherie.
     The first experiments were made with hollow cylinders of
 metal, open at top, and partly filled with water.           In the centre
 of each cylinder a needle was insulated)          by surrounding it with
 wax in such a manner as to keep it at an equal distance from
 the sides of the cylinder, whilst a thin slip of lead, or a piece
 of leaden wire attached to the lower end of the needle, was thus
 kept in the axis of the cylinder, and with its point resting on the
 bottom thereof.
     In this disposition of the apparatus the metallic cylinder was
 connected with the outside of a large electrical battery, and the
 circuit was completed by means of the discharger, by connecting
 the internal coating of the battery with the upper end of the
needles; the charge consequently passed through the small leaden
wire, which was thus melted under water in the centre of a me
tallic vessel.
     The effects produced by this experiment are, 1st, The needle
 and part of the water contained in the cylinder are projected
 from it with considerable force ; and, 2dly, The cylinder itself
is expanded more or less in proportion to its power of resistance.
Very thin cylinders yield to the first explosion ; but thicker ones
 require many repetitions of the experiment, and usually become
undulated on the surface1, whilst they expand gradually: at each
 explosion the expansion increases, and at length the cylinder is
 cracked or burst open.
     M. De Nelis has employed cylinders of various metals, and
 of different thjckness-; some of wide and others of narrow bore.
  In general the effect is greatest with those of narrow bore when
  the thickness remains the same ; but in comparative experiments
  with different metals and alloys, he did not find that their relative
  resistance corresponded with the tenacity assigned to them in
  the usual tables.     The alloys appeared to resist more than the

simple metals ; for a cylinder of pure silver was cracked at the
fourth explosion, whilst a similar cylinder of sterling silver re
sisted eleven explosions without injury; and when any soldered
 metal was employed, the solder was found less susceptible of in
jury than the metal soldered.            From these circumstances M.
 Da Nelis    is disposed  to  ascribe   the  effects produced, rather to
 the attraction of the electric fluid for the metals, than to the ex
 pansion which its rapid passage through imperfect conductors
 so invariably produces.
     Anxious to ascertain the extent to which these effects might
 be carried, he employed a cylinder of iron, 18 lines diameter*
 and 27 lines high, having a hole drilled in its axis of .one line
 and a half diameter and 1 8 lines deep ; and it was torn open
 by 70 discharges of a battery of 100 feet of coating. The, re
 sults of former experiments having rendered it probable that
 this large cylinder had yielded to a lower power than would
 have been requisite had the iron been perfect, another cylinder
 of the same size was made with great care, and 70 explosions
 produced no effect upon it.        The interior of this cylinder was
 then filled with olive oil instead of water : in 30 explosions the
 bottom was perforated, though nine lines thick ; the lateral ex
 pansion was very inconsiderable.           M. De Nelis supposes that
 in these experiments the leaden wire is minutely divided, and
 combines with the oil or water and with the electric fluid to
 form a gaseous product, which exerts a powerful action on the
 metal cylinder by which it is surrounded.           By this he appears
 not merely to express an expansive effect, but a peculiar attrac
 tion which he conceives to exist between the electric fluid and
 other bodies, and to which he applies the general term molecular
 attraction.      This peculiar action he thinks decisively evinced
 by the last experiment ; in which the bottom of the cylinder, a
 thickness of nine lines of excellent iron, was perforated, whilst
  the sides remained nearly without injury.           By an extension of
  this experiment still more remarkable effects were produced: it
  was imagined that by increasing the thickness of the cylinder
  the lateral expansion would be entirely prevented, and the ac
  tion of the charge be confined to its molecular attraction on
  the bottom of the cylinder.       An iron cylinder of 28 lines diame
  ter was drilled to within five lines of the bottom, and a cylinder
 of pure silver of the same size was procured ; they were sub
  mitted in succession to the action of the battery.             200 explo
 sions perforated the bottom of the iron cylinder, and produced
 an excavation of three lines diameter.          With the silver cylinder
  20 explosions occasioned an expansion at bottom, which con-

tinued    to increase to the 200dth explosion when it had produced
a projection       of IS lines diameter and three lines high, but no
perforation was apparent.          This cylinder was sawed through,
and the expansion which had taken place in the interior appeared
to have been produced by the action of some power determined
m every direction from a centre.           M. De Nelis appears to con
sider these experiments as a demonstration of the different mo
lecular attraction of the electric fluid for various metals : biit I
must confess that to me they seem to present no such evidence,
nor do they appear to differ materially from the usual expansive
effects   of the charge. When electricity passes luminously through
any    fluid, it invariably produces a sudden and temporary expan
sion therein,     and the expansion is greater in proportion to the
quantity and momentum of the electricity, and to the noncon
ducting power of the fluid through which it passes : hence the
spark is brighter and the expansion more considerable in oil,
alcohol, or ether, than in water ; more feeble in hot water than
in cold, and still less evident in saline fluids and concentrated
acids ; but in every case the expansion is greatest when the bulk
 of the fluid in which it occurs is least, and when the spark by
which it is produced passes through the greatest interval.          The
 arrangement employed by M. De Nelis is well calculated to ob
tain these essentials; for the small leaden wire which he has sub
 stituted for the interrupted circuit of former electricians, admits
 the passage of a much more considerable charge than could be
 conveyed through the oil or water itself by the same power ;
 whilst the fluid employed is so arranged as to occupy the least
 possible    space compatible with the luminous passage of the
 charge through it.
     In the experiments I have made on this subject I have been
 favoured with the assistance of my friend Andrew Crosse, Esq.;
 and it was by the aid of his powerful apparatus and active ex
 ertions that I was enabled to shorten the time of their per
 formance materially.         M. De Nelis generally employed a battery
 of 100 feet of coated surface, which he charged to about 60 of
  Henley's quadrant electrometer ; this was most probably equal
  to 15 grains of Cuthbertson's discharging electrometer, at least
  it is so when the index of Henley's quadrant is terminated by a
  pith-ball ; but a cork ball will only indicate about 40 with the same
  charge.     15 grains appeared therefore the most convenient power,
   and was employed in these experiments most frequently.           The
   battery   we    made   use  of consists  of 50 coated jars, exposing
   about 75 feet of coated surface ; it was charged by two cylinder
   machines, one of them 52 inches circumference, and the other
   40 inches only.       The large machine I constructed in the year
    1S08 : it is on the whole the best I have yet seen.     The smaller
                                    L 2                               one

one was adapted to the purpose of these experiments for the
occasion, and by a simple mechanical arrangement was made
equal in charging power to the large one.                       ,
     The joint action of these machines enabled us to charge the
whole battery of 75 feet coating in two minutes ; and this rate
of charging was maintained through the whole of our experi
ments.
     The metallic cylinders were all of the same size ; namely, six
lines diameter, and 21 lines high, with a bore of 2\ lines dia
meter and 18 deep.          We were provided with two of each of the
following metals, — Bismuth, zinc, tin, lead, ,iron, copper, and
brass.      A steel wire or needle, about the 40th of an inch thick
and three inches long, was then coated with wax in two places,
to such a thickness as to admit of its sliding freely into the bore
of either of the cylinders.       The length of the needle was then
prolonged by the addition of a piece of leaden wire -rrg th of an
inch diameter and nine lines long to its lower extremity, in close
contact with which it was secured by the same wax.             Fig. 1,
 Plate III, represents this needle. W is the fine leaden wire,
and     CC the coatings of wax.      All the precaution necessary in
preparing such       neeciles, is to place the wax round them with
 care, so as to keep the needle in the centre of the metallic cy
linder. when it is placed therein, during which process it is ne
cessary to keep the leaden wire as straight as possible, that its
end may rest on the bottom of the cylindrical cavity without ap
proaching any where in contact with its sides.        Several of these
needles may be prepared before the commencement of the ex
periments, as it is necessary to employ a fresh one at every ex
plosion. Fig. 2 represents one of the cylinders; its cavity (which
is shown by dotted lines) is to be filled with water or oil, and a
needle prepared as above, introduced carefully into it until the
point of the leaden wire rests on the bottom of the cylinder. To
prevent the oil or water from being thrown about, the cylinder
should be placed in a wooden box, open on one side and lined
 with lead at bottom : the bottom being connected with the out
 side of the battery, a communication is made by a wire, between
 the upper part of the needle and the receiving ball of Cuthbert-
son's discharging electrometer, the electrometer being connected
with the inside of the battery.         This arrangement is shown in
fig- 3.
      In this disposition of the apparatus, a cylinder of bismuth
 filled with water was subjected to the action of the battery of
 75 feet, charged to 15 grains. A single explosion shattered it to
 pieces, and dispersed the parts to a distance with considerable
violence.
     Another cylinder of bismuth the same size as the preceding
                                                   .               was

              Account   of some Electrical Experiments.            165
was exposed to a charge of eight grains only : it was dispersed
with nearly the same violence in one explosion.
    A cylinder of zinc of the same dimensions and under the same
arrangement, with a charge of 1 5 grains was slightly cracked at
the first explosion, and at the ninth explosion was opened by a
wide rent, as shown in fig. 4.
    A similar cylinder of zinc was filled with olive oil instead of
water ; one explosion broke a large piece out and threw it to a
distance.     This cylinder is represented in its present state by
fig. 5.
    A cylinder of tin of the same size filled with olive oil, was split
open by one explosion of a charge of 15 grains; the rent being very
similar to that of fig. 4.
    A second cylinder of tin, the same size as the preceding, and
under the same arrangement, gave a different result : it was ex
panded by the first explosion, and more so by the second and
third ; at the fourth it burst open: the rent was more consider
able than in the last experiment.
    A cylinder of iron of the same dimensions was arranged in
the usual manner with olive oil, and a charge of 15 grains: the
first explosion produced two cracks nearly the whole length of
the cylinder; the second explosion detached a portion of the
cylinder (nearly one-third) in the direction of its length, and
threw it with violence to a distance.
    The experiment was repeated with another cylinder of iron
of the same size: the first explosion produced three cracks; the
second explosion divided the cylinder in three parts in a very
curious manner, as represented by fig. 6.
    The thickness of these cylinders is greater than that of the
strongest muskets ; the expansive power of electricity acting in
 this way is therefore vastly superior to the most potent gun
powder.
    A cylinder of copper became undulated on the surface at the
 first explosion ; it expanded at the second, and continued to in
 crease with every discharge until the twelfth, when it was burst
 open nearly in the same manner as fig. 4.
     A second cylinder of copper exhibited nearly similar phaeno-
 mena : it did not crack until the 14th explosion ; but at the
 15th it was torn with a wide rent.
     A cylinder of brass, under similar circumstances, was undu
 lated on the surface, and had a small perforation at the first ex
 plosion : these effects and the expansion of the cylinder con-*
 tinued to increase with each discharge until the sixth, when a
  wide rent was produced.
     Another cylinder of brass, of the same description, exhibited

    nearly similar phaenomena, and was burst with analogous ap
    pearances at the fifth explosion : it had opened at the fourth.
      A leaden cylinder of the same. size was very much swelled by
    the first explosion, and perforated in three places : these effects
    increased greatly with the second ; and by the third it was burst
    open in a very curious manner, as is shown by fig. 7.
       This experiment was repeated with another cylinder of lead,
    with precisely the same result, and in the same number of explo
    sions.
       A cylindrical tin vessel, four inches diameter and six inches
    in height, was suspended by strings a short distance from the
    ground in the open air, on the lawn in front of the electrical
    room : the can was filled with water, and a leaden wire of two
    inches long suspended within           it,
                                      with its end touching the bottom
    ofthe can.     Acharge of the battery of 75 feet, to 15 grains, being
    passed through the leaden wire,        was melted
                                                 it       about half the

    water was projected into     the ajr to    considerable height, and

    a spherical surface.
       Ml De Nelis states that he made an experiment of this kind
    with a cylinder of two inches diameter; and that the water was
    projected to the height of 40 feet.
       He also exploded     wire in
                                  a   leaden tube of an inch diameter,

XXXII.        On the Diffusion    of Heat        at the Surface        of the Earth.
                 By John Murray, M.D. F.R.S.                      Ed*
An    argument which I had stated against the Huttonian Theory
of the Earth, in so far as it relates to the operation of a central
heat, was honoured some time ago with a reply by a distinguished
member of the Society.     Respect for the opinion of Mr. Playfair
led me to consider attentively the reasoning he employed ; and
still feeling some confidence in the grounds on which the original
argument rests, I propose to offer a few observations with regard
to it.     The question further involves the consideration of the
mode in which heat is distributed at the surface of the glebe.
This, when minutely investigated, presents a very perfect arrange
ment, by which the escape of caloric is prevented, while its equal
distribution is more effectually attained ; and the subject, under
this point of view, may have some interest, independent of it3
relation to any controversial discussion.
    The argument which I had advanced             That     is,
                                                            heat existif   a
in   the interior part of the earth, operating for an indefinite pe
riod, as  is  assumed in the Huttonian theory,         cannot for such
                                                                 it
a    period remain locally accumulated.        It must diffuse itself
through the entire mass, and become at length equal, or nearly
so, over the whole.       An equilibrium of temperature must there
fore be established, incompatible with that system of indefinitely
 renewed operations which         represented as the great excellence
                                  is
of the system.      This has always appeared to me conclusive ;.and
 .ah argument such as this, derived       priori, and directed to the
                                             a
 first principles of a geological theory,     successful,
                                                      if     of greater    is
 weight than arguments derived from its adaptation to natural
 phaenomena,     which, even when they appear to be just, amount
 only  to  probability, and, from our imperfect knowledge of the re
 lations of the mineral kingdom, leave often some degree of un
certaintyf.
  To obviate this argument, the following reasoning has been
              Mr. Playfair. The diffusion of temperature, he
               a by
employed
remarks,  is consequence of the tendency of heat to pass from
                                                        bGdies

 168                    On the Diffusion      of Heat
bodies where the temperature is higher to- those where it is lower.
 It is not, therefore, a necessary result, but is only contingent,
requiring the presence of another condition, which may be want
ing, and actually is wanting, in many instances ; — this is, that
the quantity of heat in the system should be given, and should
not admit of continual increase from one quarter, nor diminu
tion from another.         When such increase and diminution take
place, no such equilibrium can be attained.             In proof of this, he
mentions the fact, that a bar of iron thrust into the fire, though
red-hot at one extremity, will not become so at the other in
any length of time, but each part of it will have a fixed tempera
ture, lower as it is further from the fire, but remaining invaria
ble while the condition of fhe fire, and of the surrounding me
dium, continues the same.           He illustrates it also more fully by
the following example : Let A, B, C, D, &c. be a series of con
tiguous bodies, or let them be parts of the same body ; and let
us suppose that A receives from some cause, into the nature of
which we are not here to inquire, a constant and uniform supply
of heat.     It is plain that heat will flow continuallv from A to B,
from B to C, &c.; and in order that this may take place, A must
be hotter than R, B than C, and so on ; so that no uniform dis
tribution of heat can ever take place.             The state to which the
system will tend, and at which, after a certain time, it must ar
rive, is one in which the momentary increase of the heat of
each body is just equal to its momentary decrease, so that the
temperature of each individual body becomes fixed, all these
temperatures together forming a series decreasing from A down
wards.     This is then applied to the argument in the following
manner: " If heat be communicated to a solid mass, like the
earth, from some source or reservoir in its interior, it must go
oiffiom the centre on all sides towards the circumference.                    On
arriving r.t the circumference, if it were hindered from pro
ceeding further, and if space or vacuity presented to heat an
impenetrable barrier, then an accumulation of it at the surface,
and at last a uniform distribution of it through the whole mass,
would inevitably be the consequence.              But if heat may be lost
and dissipated in the boundless fields of vacuity, or of ether,
which surround the earth, no such equilibrium can be established.
much of the beauty and unity of the system is lost. These seem to me to
require the assumption of a a ntral heat, or general reservoir of heat ca
pable of extending its action to every part of the circumference, always
existing, though not equally active in its apparent effects.         It is to this
view of the subject, consistent, I believe, with the original stutem. nt of the
theory by Dr. Huttou, that the argument applies.          It is this which Mr.
Playfair admit-, and on the admission of which, indeed, his reasoning is
founded : and, strictly speaking, It is to his reasoning only that the obser
vations in this paper are directed.
                                                                             The

                      at the Surface       of the Earth.                         169
The tempterature of the earth will theii continue to augment,
onlv till the heat which issues from it every moment into thi
surrounding medium become equal to the increase which it re
ceives every moment from the supposed central reservoir.     Whea
this happens, the temperature at the superficies can undergo \to
further change, and a similar effect must take place with re
spect to every one of the spherical and concentric strata int9
which we may conceive the solid mass of the globe to be divided.
Each of these must in time come to a temperature at which it
will give out as much heat to the contiguous stratum on the out
side, as it receives from the contiguous stratum on the inside; and
when this happens, its temperature will remain invariable*."
   The principle on which this reasoning rests will not be dis
puted.    Admitting it therefore, my objects in attempting to sup
port  the  original argument will be to show, first, that such a
discharge of heat from the surface of the earth as is here sup
posed does not take place ; and, secondly, that if it did, this
would be as subversive of the system, as if the heat were re
tained.
    There are two modes in which caloric may be supposed to be
conveved from the surface of the earth ; one is by radiation, the
other by slow communication by die medium of the elastic fluid
which surrounds it.      Each of these may be briefly considered.
    The great expansibility and mobility of an elastic fluid, such
as the atmosphere,    give rise to a peculiarity with regard to the
communication of temperature through it.         Its proper conduct
ing power appears to be inconsiderable; but whatever it may be,
it is principally by the motion of its parts that heat is diffused
through its mass. When the temperature of a lower portion of
such a fluid is raised, it ascends rapidly; a fresh portion comes
in contact with the surface communicating        heat ; and by this
successive application and retrocession of the air, and this move
ment of the heated portion, rather than by the direct commu
nication of caloric from one part to another, the temperature of
the whole is raised.      It is in this manner that heat is diffused
from the earth into the atmosphere.        The air incumbent on any
part of the surface communicating heat,
                                                       is,    by
                                                       the elevation of
 its temperature, rarefied, whence an ascending current        formed;    is
and the common opinion with regard to this               that  is,
                                                                carries   it
 the excess of heat to the higher regions    of the  atmosphere, and
 may allowit   to be diffused into the interplanetary space.                    It   is
 on the assumption    of this that the heat must be supposed, in
 Mr. Playfair's argument, to be discharged from the earth, so far
 at least asit   is conveyed from the surface                 by
                                                      the surrounding

  i/O                   On the Diffusion  of Heat
 elastic medium.       The just view of the operation of the atmo
sphere in diffusing heat, is however more complicated; other
 conditions connected with it are to be taken into account, and
 lead, I believe, to a very different result.
    The air heated at any part of the earth's surface, may, as it
ascends, impart, especially at first, a portion of heat to the air
with which it comes in contact.        But as it rises, becoming sub
ject to less pressure, it expands ; by this its capacity for heat is
augmented, and its temperature, therefore, falls proportionally.
As it recedes from the surface, with its temperature thus con
stantly falling, from its increasing capacity, its tendency to part
with heat is always becoming less; and as it must continue to
rise in the atmosphere until it attain an equilibrium of tempe
rature with the air around, any tendency to communicate heat
to that air must at length cease. If it retained its high tempe
rature, or if it were to lose this gradually only from the commu
nication of its heat, it might be conceived to convey caloric on
wards ; but its capacity for caloric increasing from its rarefaction
as it ascends, it is enabled to retain the excess of heat it had
received, without having a corresponding elevation of tempera
ture.    It is only when it returns towards the surface, in conse
quence of that circulation which the constant ascent of portions
of heated air establishes in the atmosphere, that this is evolved.
As it descends, it becomes progressively subject to greater pres
sure, its capacity gradually diminishes ; and continuing to do
so as it falls, it gives out in the same gradual manner the excess
of heat which it contains.       Thus, for every portion of heat con
veyed by the ascent of a stratum of heated air from any part of
the circumference of the globe, a corresponding portion of heat
is given out by a descending stratum at some other part ; and
as this communication      of heat from the atmosphere will happen
principally at the colder parts of the earth's surface, both as the
descent of the air will be there greatest, and the disposition to
receive heat also greatest, the whole forms an admirable arrange
ment to counteract local inequalities of temperature, to diffuse
heat equally over the globe, and to prevent. any dissipation of it
beyond the sphere of the atmosphere.
    It is thus, I conceive, demonstrated, that by the principal
mode in which heat is propagated through the atmosphere, — that,
by the motion of the heated portion of air, it can only be with
drawn to comparatively a short distance from the surface of the
earth, and that there is a constant return of it.       By direct com
munication its conveyance must be equally limited ; the con
ducting power of an aeriform body is extremely imperfect, and,
there is every reason to believe, becomes less as the fluid be
comes more rare ; and in the higher regions of the atmosphere
                                                                    the

                    at the Surface       of the Earth.                                 171
the subtilty of the medium is so great, that beyond a certain
height it cannot be supposed to be the vehicle of the conveyance
of heat, far less that it can convey it into the boundless fields of
vacuity.
  But, further, were the conducting power of the most perfect
kind, no effect could arise from it in the conveyance of caloric
beyond a certain height.          The communication of heat from one
part of a mass of matter to another, or from one body to another,
depends, a3 Mr. Playfair justly observes, on difference of tem
perature ; and if there is no difference, there will be no such
communication.           Now, a little reflectibn will show, that this
completely limits the diffusion of heat through an elastic fluid,
receiving it under such conditions as our atmosphere.               The air
heated at the surface expanding as it rises, but at the same time
from this expanion falling in temperature, must come at length
to be in equilibrium, both in density and in temperature, with
air at a certain height ; its further ascent will then cease, and
its temperture being the same with that of the air around                          it,   it
will yield none of its heat.        It   isonly in its descent, as      fresh a
 portion    of air  rises, thatit    will evolve   caloric, and    will con
                                                                         it
 tinue uniformlv to do so, as      it returns to the surface of the earth.
    We thus trace    a     curious provision to prevent any discharge
 of heat by the atmosphere into the interplanetary space                  the      ;
 excess at particular regions       is   only withdrawn,       more equally
                                                                is
distributed over the surface, but         is  ultimately communicated to
 the earth  ;   and thereis     no other apparent arrangement          which  by
 this could have been attained, than                an atmosphere consti

 mit of an unlimited conveyance of heat, a solid mass, however
 subtile, would have been required, or an atmosphere the capacity
 of which for caloric should not increase with its rarefaction.
     The passage of heat      is   thus from the circumference towards
 the centre of the globe, instead of the opposite direction, and                         it
is  prevented from accumulating at the surface only                  by
                                                                 being cos,-
 veyed into    the    mass  of earth.
     These conclusions may be applied to the present argument.
If   the view   I  have stated be just, we have demonstration that the
 atmosphere      conveys    no heat into unlimited space         our planet,
                                                                     ;

 were  by   a  wall of non-conducting matter, and no arrangement
  ran be imagined more perfect,           by which the heat belonging to
it   could be confined.        If the heat from the centre, Mr. Playfair
  observes, on arriving at the circumference, were prevented from
  proceeding further, and     if    space or vacuity presented to heat an
  impenetrable barrier, then an accumulation of              at the surface,
                                                               it

 172                    On the Diffusion      of Heat
and at last a uniform distribution of it through the whole mass,
would inevitably be the consequence.                 It appears that the at
mosphere      does   present   such   a  barrier,     and the consequence,
therefore, necessarily follows*.
    This is true, at least, so far as relates to any power of the
atmosphere to convey heat.             There is still to be considered,
hpwever, another mode in which caloric may be supposed tobe«
discharged from our planet, — that by radiation.             Rays possessed
of heating power are thrown off from a body at a high tempera
ture, and by the discharge of these its temperature is reduced.
But various considerations show, that this would be a very in
adequate source of the escape of heat from the interior part of
the earth.
   Thus the radiation of caloric is inconsiderable, except from a
body which is heated; and the quantity radiated increases as
the temperature rises in a much higher ratio than the increase
of temperature itself.        At low temperatures, therefore, it must
be extremely small.        At lOO0 it is scarcely apparent, from ex
periment ; and at 50' is not sensible.                 Not only, too, does
the quantity diminish rapidly with the temperature, but the
projectile force of the rays emitted becomes less, so that those
which are discharged at low temperatures are incapable of pe
netrating media such as glass, which those at high temperatures
penetrate with facility.       And as even the latter are, to a certain
extent, intercepted by       the atmospheric air, the former must be
more completely arrested.          At 50°, therefore, the medium tem
perature of the globe, and which prevails over so large a portion
of its surface, we have no reason to believe that a discharge of
caloric by radiation, into remote space, can take place to any
extent.
    At the parts of the surface of the earth which are at still lower
temperatures, and at those where intense cold prevails, the sup
position of any radiation is of course still more precluded, and
the negative even may be proved.            When a solid body, and the
surrounding     elastic  medium,    are  at the    same temperature, there
   * If the sphere from the centre of which heat is supposed to be diffused,
be not exposed to an unequal external source of heat, the heat will be com
municated equally at its circumference to the incumbent atmosphere, and
produce ascent and descent of the air, with little of that circulation of it
from one part to another, which is the consequence of inequality of tem
perature at the surface of the solid.   But still the same changes of capacity
for heat will accompany the ascent and descent of the aerial mass, and the
principal effect will be, to accumulate temperature at the surface.      The
condition is one, however, which need not to be taken iuto account, as it is
one which has never existed with regard to our planet; and the argument
remains as is stated above, while there is inequality in the distribution
of heat over the circumference of the globe.
                                                                       seems

  seems to be ho discharge     of radiant heat from the former ; and
  still more, when the temperature of the solid is lower than that
  of the elastic medium, (and this is usually the case in colder re
  gions,) it is rather disposed to absorb than to emit caloric by
  radiation.    The resistance, too, opposed by the atmosphere to
  the discharge of rays having the weak projectile force which those
  emitted at such a low temperature must have, would in a great
  measure prevent their escape, if the power to radiate did actually
  exist.
     At the hotter parts of the earth's surface there may be some
  emission of caloric by radiation, but it is not difficult to show,
  that the quantity of this cannot be equal to the quantity com
  municated by the solar rays ; for of the heat derived from the
  latter source, a portion is absorbed by the earth, and conveyed
  to the interior, as is apparent from the decreasing temperature,
  as we recede from the surface to a certain depth ; and another
  portion is carried off by the ascending current of heated air, and
  conveyed to colder regions, where it is also absorbed.
      Thus, even from those parts of the surface of the earth where
  the circumstances are those most favourable to radiation, the
  quantity radiated cannot be equal to the quantity received by the
  solar rays'.  Over the whole surface, the difference must be still
  greater; and instead of the conclusion, that this planet discharges
  an excess of heat by radiation, there is every reason to draw the
  opposite conclusion, — that part of the he*tt which it receives
  from the sun is retained.
      The only reason, at least, that would lead to hesitation in ad
  mitting this last inference, is a hypothetical one, — that it is in
  consistent with that perfect arrangement, which we are disposed
  to believe exists among all the heavenly bodies, whence the sta
  bility of the entire system is maintained, and whence, therefore,
  in relation to any communication      of caloric among them, the
  quantity radiated by each will, on the whole, be equal to what
  it receives.   This, whether we restrict the view to the different
   parts of our solar system, or extend it even to the universe, is no
   doubt the conclusion which the imagination is naturally disposed
   to embrace, though it may not be supported on any decisive evi
   dence, or may even be in some measure apparently in opposition
.  to the fact.   But to suppose that this planet discharges more
   ealoric than it receives, would be not only in opposition to evi
   dence, but in opposition to the very principle which alone leads
,  to the admission that the quantity discharged may be equal to
   the quantity received.
      Concluding, then, as it appears to me may be strictly inferred
   from the preceding reasoning, that our earth does not discharge
   ealoric from its surface into the regions of space, or at least docs
                                                                    not

174                     0«   the Diffusion   of Heal
not discharge more than       it receives from the other heavenly
bodies, if it discharge even this, the argument recurs, I believe,
in its original form, as sufficiently established, that if an interior
heat exist, it must be diffused through the substance of the earth,
and an equilibrium of temperature be at length established, in
compatible with those operations ascribed to its action in the
Huttonian theory.
   But. further, though the heat were not retained, — though it
were granted that it is propagated into the regions of space, this
does not render the argument I have urged less conclusive.        The
strength of that argument lies in the circumstance of the dif
fusion of heat from the interior, not in the accumulation of that
heat at the surface.     The latter is a contingent event, which may
or may not happen, without being of essential importance in the
conclusion to be drawn.        The former is a necessary result, which
must prove subversive of the arrangement, the assumption of
which constitutes the leading principle of Dr. Hutton's system.
   Mr. Playfair, accordingly, in the general case which he takes
for the illustration of his argument, assumes a constant supply
nf lieat at the centre, as well as a constant escape of it from the
circumference.       But in applying the argument, where is the
proof    of  such  a supply of heat at the centre of the earth ?     It
can scarcely be necessary to remark, that none is attempted to
be given.      And were it allowable to make an assumption, with
out evidence, merely, to obviate an argument, the force of which
cannot otherwise be avoided, no hypothesis, even the most ex
travagant, could ever be overturned.         Heat cannot originate in
nothing ;    and  if we  assume   its constant discharge from the cir
cumference of this planet^ what cause is it possible to assign for
its constant supply from the interior ? Admit even its existence
in any degree of intensity, still it is obvious that it must be in
limited quantity.      If we speak of a spring of heat, as conveying
the idea of an unlimited supply, we deceive ourselves by the use
of a term to which no definite signification can Oe affixed, but
what is subversive of the reasoning it is designed to support.        A
source or spring means nothing more than a hidden reservoir
connected with external supplies.         There can be no reservoir of
heat in the centre of the earth, which, without being recruited
by constant supply, shall continue to furnish          it,
                                                      to be discharged
from the circumference through indefinite time into unlimited
space.      And
              it   is  not possible to imagine any circulation       by
which  it   shall be restored.
    It is, therefore, conceive, of little importance in the discus
                        1
sion, whether the heat supposed to be conveyed from the centre
to the circumference        accumulated there, or
                            is                          discharged into
                                                        is

                                                                  sub

subversive       of its accumulation in the interior.
                                                    Either the dif
fusion alone,   therefore, or the  diffusion attended  with the final
result of equilibrium of temperature, is sufficient for the refuta
tion of the hypothesis.     Both I conceive are established.    And
I would still regard the argument in the light in which 1 first
advanced         it,
                as     demonstration of the fallacy of the leading
                            a
principle  of the  Huttonian  system, which assumes the existence
of an internal heat operating at renewed periods for indefinite
time.
   There are some other points of view under which the subject
may be considered, in which the difficulties attending the assump
tion of an internal heat, when connected with the law which
Mr. Playfair has illustrated, appear in very strong light.
                                                       a
      has always been found difficult to give any account of the
     It
origin of the supposed internal heat, to the operation of which
the consolidation of minerals, and the elevation of the habitable
land from the bed of the ocean, have been ascribed.        the view
                                                                  If
be restricted to the production even of one world, such an                    in
tensity and ebntinuance of heat are necessary for this single ef
fect, that no adequate cause can be even hypothetically assigned
for   it.   If   it    be extended to the successive production       of three
or four    worlds, each embracing       period between its formation
                                             a
and    destruction in which millions of  years must elapse, — an event
which,   according to the theory,        not only possible, but has
                                                 is
actually occurred, — the heat required       altogether beyond what
                                                       is
the imagination can conceive.      But    in addition to this, caloric
                                                  if,
is also diffused from the interior, and discharged from the cir
cumference of the globe into unlimited space, we are lost in the
magnitude of the result, and are unable to acquire           just con

ception of the force of the argument, from the impossibility of
contemplating clearly the difficulty      all its extent.

'
assumed to exist,     not less great than that from its continuance
                             is
and waste.           sufficiently apparent, when we consider that
                       It   is
the highest mountains of the globe run in extensive chains, aad
are so connected, that they must have been formed at one time,

ment which must be made, in consequence of the law, that the
internal temperature       k decreasing one from the interior tc the
                                  is

     we can discover the rate of this decrease,

form some calculation of the intensity of the heat which exists
at the commencement of the series.       Now this we have the
means of determining with consideiable precision,     At the bot

     to the bottom of the sea must of course have been at a similar
     rate of diminution.       Ifwe were to calculate the rate of pro

'   succeeding five inches, what must be its intensity at the other
     extremity  ?    No effort of the imagination can form the most
     remote conception of      it,nor can any argument be w-anting to
     prove, that no such heat can exist in the interior of the earth.

Add a few observations of a more general nature, wliich the pre
 ceding reasoning suggests with regard to the temperature of the
globe, and its relation to solar heat.   From the nature of the
agency of the atmosphere in diffusing heat, the conclusions seem
to me almost necessarily to follow, — that there is a tendency to
equalization of temperature over the whole surface of the earth,
— that this continues to operate in such a manner, that in the
progress of time the difference at different parts must become
less than what existed at a preceding    period ; and that, ulti
mately, a temperature nearly uniform shall be established over
the    whole.
    At the hotter parts of the earth's surface, the temperature can
not increase, or must increase very slowly, and to no great ex
tent ; for, if it were to rise higher, the ascent of heated air from
it, and the transfer of this to the colder parts of the surface,
would only become more rapid.            But the temperature at the
colder regions may rise higher; for the direct ascent of heated
air    there less abundant, and what recedes
      is                                              in lateral direction,
                                                           a
does so, deprived of caloric, which         it has yielded to the earth.
Whatever discharge of caloric, too, may take place by radiation,
must be principally from the hotter parts of the surface               from;
the colder        must be much less considerable, for the quantity
                 it
radiated    isless as the temperature      low:
                                          is          increases, too, at
                                                      it                           a
higher    ratio  than  the increase   of  temperature       and hence,
                                                                ;                  if
increased radiation from increased temperature did take place at
both, being greater at the former than at the latter, its effects
would be more considerable in retarding           afurther augmentation
of temperature.       Thus it appears,   that  the  causes counteracting
rise of temperature at the surface of the globe, act most power
fully at those parts where      it  high, and any progressive rise,
                                     is
therefore, must be principally at those where               low.

    The effect of this arrangement may be most obvious, perhaps,
from comparing the two extremes.          At the equator, the ascending
current of warm air, carrying     off  heat,     constant or nearly so
                                                 is                                ;
towards the poles, the descending current imparting heat, must
be equally constant.       The heat directly communicated at the
former      by
             the solar rays, and the heat communicated at the lat
ter    bythe current of warm air, will both be in part conveyed
through the solid mass towards the interior           but this will always
                                                      ;

                                                                          is
 the first or exterior layer will be at     a higher temperature than
 the second, the second than the third, and the accumulation,
 therefore, will be at the surface, to a certain extent.            At the
 poles this may continue to proceed, because heat               there com
                                                                     is
 municated without an equal abstraction.'          But at the equator              it

178                  On the Diffusion    of Heat
will remain stationary, or nearly so, as no increase can take plac*
without the abstraction both by the atmosphere and by radiation
becoming proportionally greater.
    This is aided by another effect, that with regard to the dif
fusion of heat through the solid mass itself.      This diffusion from
 the surface proceeds in part towards the centre, or each layer,
as the surface is receded from, receives a portion of heat from
the exterior one, and this continues onwards, though with a
gradual diminution.      But there must be at the same time adif-
fusiou more nearly horizontal, proceeding through these layers
from the equator towards the poles, while there can be none in
the opposite direction to counteract this effect.
    The ocean, too, serves to convey a considerable portion of
heat from the warmer to the colder regions of the earth, by the
movement of currents, somewhat similar to those which exist in
 the atmosphere, and the course of which it is even possible to
trace.                                      ,
    Thus, by these various arrangements, whatever excess of        heat
may be received by this planet from the sun, and retained at the
surface, will be permanently accumulated towards the poles, and
the temperature there will increase.        In all the portions of the
intermediate space,    between   the poles and  the equator, the same
law will operate, though with decreasing force ; and over the
whole surface, there is a tendency to equality of temperature,
which, however slow the progression to it may be, must, as the
result of general causes constant in their operation, be finally
established.
    The speculations, then, on which some have dwelt,— that the.
northern parts of our globe have suffered a gradual refrigeration,
and which Bailly, in particular, applied to the fanciful system
which he supported with so much ingenuity, — that civilization
and science have descended from the elevated regions of the
north of Asia, — have probably no foundation. It is always in
teresting to trace the succession of opinions which mark the pro
gress of knowledge, and to observe how far what at one period
is considered as established, is at another rendered doubtful, or
proved to be false.    The refrigeration of the globe from the loss
of its interior heat, is a fact, says the author just referred to, of
which there can be no doubt ; and this refrigeration, he adds,
must have been principally towards the poles, partly from the
flattening of the sphere there, in consequence of which the heat
from the centre must escape sooner, but still more from the un
equal action of the solar rays, which is more intense towards the
equator.     Hence the countries round the poles must have been
the  first that were habitable, and this gradual cooling has caused

                          at the Surface     of the Earth.                                179
the same temperature to proceed successively over all the regions
of the globe*. Not only are these conclusions unfounded, but
the changes which have occurred are probably the very reverse.
No heat can escape from this planet, but in consequence of a
high temperature being kept up at its Surface by the communi
cation of heat from aU external source.    Until this be attained,
it must retain the heat it receives from the sun ; and this must
accumulate principally towards the poles.
   That the temperature at the surface has risen above the ori
ginal temperature of the earth, may be inferred not only from
the consideration, that solar heat has been communicated to                                   it,
which could not be discharged until           certain elevated tempera
                                                  a
ture were attained, but also from this, that there             no natural   is
operation actually generating cold there     ;        only the production
                                                             is
of heat and cold prevails where this
          ;                                    less powerful, or

teracted. To account, therefore, for the low temperature at the
colder regions of the earth, only two suppositions can be ad
vanced. Either the original temperature must have been as low
as this, or lower, and have been raised higher, where             actually     itis
superior,     bythe reception of the sun's rays        or    must be as
                                                              :         it
 sumed, with Buffon and Bailly, that heat can escape from this
planet to an indefinite extent, and that               in state of pro
                                                        it    is        a
gressive refrigeration,      the effects of which are prevented from
 being apparent at the equatorial regions                by
                                                     the direct communi
 cation of Solar heat, but towards the polar circles are evident, as
 not being counteracted             by
                                  the same cause.       This assumption,
 however,     is
               precluded       by
                               the  proof,  that  heat     not capable of

 the lowest natural temperature, and of course that the mean

solar rays, and it cannot proceed beyond this.        The first con
clusion necessarily follows, when it is proved that radiation is
the only mode by which caloric can escape from this planet.
The second conclusion is equally evident.         Thus the tendency
Is to an equal and uniform temperature.          How far this may be
from that which at present exists, it is difficult to determine.
If the increase of heat is accompanied with its more 'equal dif
fusion, so as to establish nearly the same temperature over the
entire surface, it may not proceed much beyond that which now
prevails at the hotter parts of the earth ; for at this, when ex
tended .over the whole, the quantity of caloric radiated may be
equal to that received.      And even if it were to rise higher than
this; still, from gradual changes in the laws of organized matter,
 or in the species of living beings, not greater than what seem to
 have occurred in the past revolutions of the globe, the existing
 temperature might be sufficiently compatible with the continuance
 of animated existence, and with an order not very different even
from that which now prevails.

   . Different views have been presented of the relation of the tem
 perature of the globe to solar heat.      Some have imagined that
 the earth is in a state of progressive refrigeration ; and while it
 Was believed that the atmosphere could convey heat onwards
 without limitation, this conclusion might be drawn.           Others,
 from considering merely the constant communication            of solar
heat, have drawn the opposite conclusion, that its temperature
 must increase, and this indefinitely.        While a more probable
 opinion than either, founded on the apparent uniformity of na
 tural operations in those past periods to which any records reach,
 is, that the temperature has always been the same, or nearly the
 same, as that which now prevails.       The view which follows from
 the preceding observations       different from all these, and pre
                                  is

cannot be either unlimited increase of heat, or indefinite refri
geration;    but the final result will be   state of permanence and
                                             a
uniformity, the continuance of which          secured

  not increase, but are so adjusted, that when they reach certain
  limits they recede, and within this state of oscillation the stabi
  lity of the entire system is for ever secured.      It would gratify.
  the mind, could it be shown that a similar system exists with
  regard to the subordinate parts ; or, if not, that a state of per
  manence in these parts will be ultimately established, compati
  ble with the operation of that more general law under which the
  order of the universe is maintained.        In the structure of the
  globe, however, and in the operations to which it is subject,
  there are evident causes of disintegration, which seem incom
  patible with a state of permanence, and from which, in the pro
  gress of time, those arrangements which constitute it a habitable
  world must apparently be subverted.        For the Huttonian theory
  has been claimed the praise (with what justice need not here
  be inquired) of unfolding a system of renovation corresponding
  to this waste.     In the opposite theory, no similar attempt has
  been made ; its object has been merely to trace the arrangements
k which exist in the mineral kingdom, and from these to infer the
  order and mode in which they have been framed; nor have any
  causes been pointed out, as, indeed, none seem to follow from
   the principles of the theory, by which that disintegration, the
   occurrence of which in past periods is so clearly marked, and the
  operation of which, even at present, is to be traced, may be re
   paired..        -                                                   '.'
      If the view, however, which has been given of the relation of
  the temperature of the earth to solar heat be just, this deficiency
  may perhaps be supplied.      Inequality of temperature is the great
   source of change and of disintegration      at the surface ; the ex
   pansion and contraction from alternations of heat and cold, the
   absorption and expulsion of humidity from the same causes, the
   distending force of congelation, and the rapid precipitation and
   flow. of water, which are the principal, or rather the sole, disin
   tegrating processes of general or uniform operation, being the
   results of it.   When inequality of temperature, therefore, shall
   cease, or be restrained within much narrower limits, an order
   may be established of less vicissitude, and less waste, than that
   which now prevails, and the stability of which may even remaini
                                                                     .

       This view, if it is not carrying the speculation too far, may
   even be extended to all the parts of our solar system, and the
   condition of each planet may be connected in permanence with
    that law which appears to regulate the constitution of the uni
   verse.    Considering this earth as passing through a series of re
   volutions from its chaotic state to a more permanent and perfect
   form, the different planets may be regarded as in a similar pro
   gression.    Astronomers have often traced the analogy" which ex-

ists. among them,   not only in the laws of their motions, but in
the figure of their masses ; they have not failed to remark ths
flattening at the poles, which can be observed in some of them,
similar to that of our globe, proving a similar state of fluidity
from which this figure has originated ; and they have endeavoured
even to draw from the aspect which they exhibit, indications of
the stage of progression in which they now are*.        But they have
presented no pleasing prospect of the final adjustment of this
series of revolutions.    Regarding the planets as extinct suns, or
fragments   of suns, or at least as masses which have been hot and
luminous, they have supposed them to be in a state of gradual
refrigeration, which will terminate in the total cessation of move
ment and animated existence.           The assumption on which this
gloomy hypothesis     is built, — that of the unlimited escape of heat
from each planetary mass, — is fortunately as false, as the view to
which it leads is unworthy of the order and magnificence which
the system of nature displays ; and instead of this termination,
in what one of these philosophers emphatically calls the state of
ice and death, of silence and repose, we mav with more confi
dence look to the equal diffusion of heat through the mass of
each planet, as the state of permanence under which it will exist,
 and to the equal interchange of heat among all, as the perfection
 of the system they form.

Sir, — the present communication, I shall offer a few observa*

sandstone usually associated with it hold in theWernerian system.
I shall then proceed to make some remarks upon the red ground,
chiefly for the purpose of showing how repeatedly the beds of
this formation have been confounded with the red sandstone ac
companying the mountain limestone ; as also to point out the

                      Geological Observations.                      183
     Ibelieve it is an opinion with many, that the limestone which
so  constantly incloses the coal-fields in England belongs to the
transition series.     This opinion is most distinctly stated in a re
cent publication by Dr. Kidd, who has at some length endeavoured
to show the correspondence of the gray mountain limestone of
Somersetshire, and elsewhere, with the transition limestone of the
VVernerian arrangement.        This opinion appears to me to be very
erroneous; for, in the country which I have described, there are,
1 think,
          sufficient grounds for referring it to the first floetz series.
In geological examinations it frequently happens that individual
rocks are so indifferently characterized, that it is impossible, with
out attending to the formations with which they may be accom
panied, to refer them to their true position in a systematic ar
rangement.        When a rock, as limestone, occurs in all the grand
divisions of a system, it is most hopeless, without such correla
tive evidence, to guess at its true geological rank; for limestone,
whether from a primitive transition or a flcetz country, must
still be carbonate of lime ; and it is hardly to be expected that
the same substance should assume characters decisive of the
class to which it belongs.         Thus the primitive or granular
limestone, which is well characterized by its highly crystalline
fracture, sometimes occurs among floetz and transition strata; but
no geologist, in seeing the granular limestone in situ with mica
 slate or gneiss, would hesitate in calling it primitive ; for thes*
 rocks never occur among those of the floetz or transition de
 scription.     In the same manner, no one upon seeing limestone
 associated with gray wacke, would doubt as to its being transi
 tion, for gray wacke is a rock exclusively of transition formation.
 Provided therefore our system be correct, however puzzling it
 may be by external characters alone to refer any rock, common
 to all the divisions of the system, to its true position, by attending
 to its geological relations we soon find a solution of our diffi
 culties.    I have made these remarks, because Dr. Kidd, in con
 sidering   the   mountain limestone to be transition, has been a
  good  deal  guided by its sometimes (though never where I have
  seen      agreeing, as to its external characters, with those which
          it)
  Mr. Jameson has ascribed to transition limestone, while he has
  completely misunderstood or overlooked its relation with other
rocks.
      will be seen,
     It               byreferring to my Description of the Neigh
 bourhood of Bristol, that the mountain limestone rests upon           a
 red sandstone.   I have only, indeed, mentioned two places where
 this connexion can be observed         but this
                                          ;       I am persuaded       is
 owing to the  sandstone  occupying  the  champaign and cultivated
 parts of the country, so that  it difficult to ascertain its existence
                                     is

tion is displayed by some such section as I have described. My
friend Dr. Prichard of Bristol informs me, by letter, that he has
observed the same arrangement, i. e. the red sandstone dipping
under the limestone at the north part of the basin about Crora-
hall.                                                     ,U
 *
   Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, as I have remarked in my
former paper, exhibit the same stratification, which, according
to Dr. Prichard, continues into Brecknockshire*.    Other writers
have mentioned the same disposition of strata.   It appears from
Mr. Bakewell's section and account of the geology of Northum
berland and Durham, in the Philosophical Magazine for Fe
bruary last, that in crossing the island from the coast of Dur
ham to. the Irish Channel, the mountain limestone is immediately
succeeded by the red sandstone.       Mr. Aikin, in his account of
the great coal-field of Shropshire,      says that the limestone,
which from its lying immediately beneath the coal can be no
other than the mountain limestone, is associated to a very con
siderable extent with sandstone; and in another part he consi
ders this sandstone as identified with the old red sandstone.
From these authorities it appears that the mountain limestone
is pretty constantly accompanied by the red sandstone, which
as constantly is situated below it,    I have little doubt that this
arrangement will be found still more general through the coal
districts in England; but hitherto, most unfortunately, the red
sandstone has been perpetually confounded with the red marl,
and has been extravagantly considered as one of its bedsf . With
regards to the geological position of the red sandstone, there can,
I think, be but one opinion.     It answers exactly to the descrip
tion of the old red sandstone of Werner, and precisely resembles
the red sandstone in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, and in
the isle of Arran, which are considered by Professor Jameson as
characteristic localities of the formation in question.   This opi
nion, as I have just now mentioned, is distinctly stated by Mr,
Aikin.     If,then, this be the old red sandstone of Werner, the
first of the floetz .series, we may fairly presume that the lime-*

                                         a     pure chemical deposit, and that
the pebbles which occur so abundantly in particular           strata, are to be
viewed not as the result of mechanical attrition, but as contemporaneous
with the basis in which they are set, being formed      by some particular mo
dification in  the process of crystallization, by which the siliceous particles
were attracted together in the form of pebbles, instead of grains of .sand.

                                                         is
belonging   to the flcetz or  transition series. The red sandstone
which so commonly accompanies the mountain limestone in
other parts of England,      here wanting, and its constant alterna

language and confused description of those who have seen most
of the Derbyshire coal-field, seem to be quite different from
those usually associated with the coal in England.
   Dr. Pri chard, in late number of the Annals of Philosophy,
                             a
has endeavoured to show that the mountain limestone belongs
to the transition series     because the organic remains which
                                 ;                                                       it
contains are similar to those which are assigned to transition
rocks.   And hence he concludes that the first flcetz limestone
of Werner, to which another description of fossils belongs,                              is
more recent than the rocks of the coal formations in England.
The fact, however, that the fossils of the mountain and transi
tion limestone are of the same description,      does not appear to
rae to warrant the conclusion      which lie wishes to deduce from
it
 ;  for,   the mountain limestone he transition,

that the red sandstone which lies under                it   must also be transi

Mr. Horner      considers them as decidedly transition and as       ;            it

can,  I think, be no doubt of their being entitled to this deno

                       a
Geological Society, and of which Dr. Thomson has given an
extract in his Annals of Philosophy, the Quantock Hills are de
scribed as being composed of a gray wacke formation alternating
with strata of clay-slate.      Within the latter strata beds of lime
stone   are  included,   which   are therefore manifestly transition.

slate, and that a few       thin beds of transition limestone oeeur in
the slate.      These, as far as 1 have been able to collect, are the
only instances of the occurrence of transition limestone in Eng-
land : it is yet to be ascertained, whether the primitive or fo
liated limestone anywhere exists in this country.         The only pri
mitive districts in England are Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and
North Wales. The two former have now been minutely examined,
without any locality having been given of this rock: — the proba
bility of its occurrence is therefore confined to North Wales.
     Having made these remarks upon the classification of the
limestones in England, I proceed to offer some observations on
the red ground,       in order to show that much confusion       prevails
in regard to the beds that properly constitute this formation.          If
we attend to the general succession of rocks in England, we ob
serve a striking conformity to the truly admirable system of Wer
ner.      In Cornwall, and in the Isle of Man, we have granite and
clay-slate;     and in North Wales, according to Mr. Aikin (see
his Tour through North Wales), we have granite, mica- slate,
hornblende-slate, serpentine, and other primitive rocks.           In the
above-mentioned districts, upon the primitive rocks rest those
 of the transition formation, consisting of gray wacke, limestone,
and gray wacke-slate, which, however, sometimes, as at Mal
vern, in Cumberland, &c. are found unassociated by the older
 rocks. — Upon the transition series, as has been well remarked
 by Dr. Prichard in the paper above referred to, repose in almost
every district the members of the first flcetz formation, the old.
 red sandstone and mountain limestone, upon one of which all
 the eoal formations in England, with the exception of that in
 Derbyshire, seem to recline. — Independent of these formations,
 an extensive series of horizontal strata is observed in many part*
 of England to cover the coal-fields, and the mountain limestone
 and red sandstone by which they are inclosed.           Of this class of
 strata, the lowest, or those immediately covering the coal-fields,
 and their inclosing strata, are the beds of what is called the Red
 Ground.       Above these occurs the lyas limestone, which is fol
 lowed by several varieties of oolite, and then again by the chalk.
 From this statement it is obvious, that the red ground or rock
 marl must be of later origin than the coal-measures or the first
  flcetz formation.     But such have been the inaccuracy and con
  fusion of those who have had the best opportunities of ascertain
  ing the true nature of the red ground, and its relative position
  with other formations, that not only members of the flcetz but
  even of the transition series have been referred to this formation.
   Thus, Mr. Farey in his account of Derbyshire,          when enume
  rating   the  beds,  or,  as he calls them,  the  products of the red
  ground;    mentions after gypsum and sandstone strata, sienite and
                                                                          c

roof or clay-slate, and probably, says he, the Kienite of Malvern
belongs to this formation. (Report, p. 152.)           It is quite un
necessary for me to make any comments upon so strange an
error as that of placing the sienite and slate of Derbyshire and
Malvern hills (which certainly belong to the transition series, but
which some have even called primitive,) in the same formation
with the gypsum of the red ground, between which and the
sienite, in point'of regular succession, there intervene the red
sandstone, mountain limestone, and coal deposit with all its ac
companying measures. — As well, I apprehend, might Mr. Farey,
upon seeing a mountain of granite rising 3000 feet above the
surface of sancLor gravel which surrounds its base, call the gra
nite a bed in such matters, as the sienite a bed or product of the
red ground.     But Mr. Farey, in fact, seems to despise every tiling
like a systematic arrangement, and calls, forsooth, the confusion
which he wishes to introduce, English Geology.
     Mr. Townsend in his work upon Moses vindicated for vera
city, &c. has committed a mistake not less important. At p. 156,
he describes the quartz sandstone of Brandon hill near Bristol,
which, as I have stated in my former paper, always lies in a con
formable position on the mountain limestone, as a bed in the
red ground ; whereas the least observation might have convinced
him that the true beds of the red ground have a position quite
unconformable     to this quartzy sandstone, and that between it
and the   former there  intervenes, as to the sera of their formations,
 the whole of the coal deposit.     Not less inconsistent is he when
he asserts the micaceous sandstone to be a part of the red
ground. Upon this belief, it seems strange that he did not
follow up his mistake, by saying that every stratum of coal in
the Gloucestershire and Somersetshire basis belonged to the red
ground ; for the micaceous sandstone, or Pennant stone, is uni
versally a coal measure ; and in whatever light we consider one,
 under the same point of view must we regard the other.
     Dr. Kidd in his late publication has likewise, I conceive,
 fallen into a mistake respecting this formation.        He there con
founds the red ground with the old red sandstone, and gives it
 as his opinion, that they both belong to the same formation.
 Nothing, however, as will plainly appear from what I have above
stated, can be more different than the situation of the beds of
 the red ground and the red sandstone.           No spot is more fa
 vourable for observing this difference than the neighbourhood of
 Ness, which the Doctor says he has examined.          He would there
 most distinctly see the old red sandstone dipping under the
 mountain limestone, — a situation, as every one will acknowledge,
 perfectly inconsistent with the red ground formation.'        A similar
 error, I conceive, has been committedvby Mr; Horner in his

 Account of the Salt-works near Droitwich, published in the second
volume    of the Geological Transactions. The prevailing rock
 around Droitwich, says Mr. Horner, is a fine-grained calcareo-
argillaceous sandstone of a brownish red colour, which contains
beds of a greenish-gray colour, in which are slender veins of
crystallized gypsum.      This sandstone, continues he, is the same
as that which Mr. Aikin lias described as occurring to so great
an extent in Shropshire and Staffordshire,       and which he con
siders to be the old red sandstone of Werner.           The sandstone
which Mr. Horner here describes, answers exactly to the de
scription of that which I have mentioned in my former paper, as
forming one of the beds of the red ground near Bristol, and is
characterized by its strongly effervescing with acids, and by its
being sometimes associated with gypsum : whereas the old red
sandstone, independent of its different geological situation, as
Mr. Aikin very justly remarks, does not effervesce with acids,
 contains spangles of mica, and, as far as I have seen or read, is
never accompanied       by gypsum.     The occurrence of gypsum
and rock-salt in England               is,

 to that formation, it may be asked, What are the true beds of the
red ground ? by which term I mean that deposit which, as to the
{era of its formation, is later than all the coal strata in England, and
of course than their inclosing rocks, and which lies immediately
under the lyas.      As far as I have seen, the lowest stratum of
the red ground is a very coarse breccia, or rather conglomerate,
which becomes finer as we ascend.               The contained masses
are rounded and angular, and consist of limestone, hornstone,
quartzy sandstone, &c.         To this succeeds a fine-grained' cal
careous sandstone, which is sometimes of a deep red and some
times of a white colour.       Above these, I believe, lies the great
deposit    of  red clay, abounding in many districts with gypsum
both   foliated  and  fibrous, and sometimes containing sulphate of
strontites.     I do not pretend to say that no other beds can with
propriety be referred to this formation ; but, as far as I may be
allowed to speak from my own experience, and the descriptions
of others, these only appear to me to belong to this formation.
 It may be worth while mentioning, that the conglomerate which
 I have formerly described as one of the red ground beds near
Bristol, has also been noticed by writers as occurring in other
districts. In a short account of the stratification of Glamor
ganshire in the xlivth vol. of the Philosophical Magazine there is
the following passage : — " About a mile west of Dunraven, a cal
careous breccia similar to that described by Mr. Gilby underlies
the lyas."      The following is a note which I have extracted from
some author, but unfortunately have neglected to take down the
name, but I think it is from Dr. Kidd. —          "A    circumstance in
the history of rock marl is its alternating with and transition
into beds which would usually be called conglomerate.               Thus
the red cliffs at Budleigh, Saltstoun near Teignmouth, and those
also of Teignmouth itself, consist of argillaceous beds with beds
of sandstone and breccia."
    The calcareous sandstone has also been noticed by other au
thors. I have mentioned above Mr. Horner's description of its
occurrence in his account of the Quantock Hills.
    Mr. Buckland, in the paper above referred to, on the rocks
situated to the east of Appleby, mentions that on the west part
of the range there occur strata of limestone, either by themselves,
or with thin seams of coal interposed nearly vertical.             Then
comes in a sandstone in nearly horizontal beds, forming, in his
opinion, part of the great deposit which overspreads the vale of
Carlisle, a large part of Cheshire, and vale of York, in which are
contained the great quarries of gypsum and beds of rock salt.
    Before closing this paper, it may be interesting to state the
occurrence of a trap rock in the neighbourhood of Bristol.               I
had frequently remarked, in travelling from Bristol to Gloucester,
                                                                     that

that the road is repaired about Newport with an amygdaloid, but
I had never an    opportunity of visiting the spot from whence it
was brought.      My friend Dr. Prichard, however, informs me,
by letter, that it is quarried from a hill at Micklewood to the
east of Newport, a few miles beyond the northern boundary of
the limestone ellipsis.    The hill itself is of very inconsiderable
extent, and perfectly unconnected        with the surrounding high
country, which to the north of it is of oolite; and in walking
south of it we first come on the red sandstone, then on the sand
stone conglomerate,      both of which we find further south at
Crorahall, dipping     under   the limestone. — From this account,
there can be no doubt, I think, that the amygdaloid rests upon
the red sandstone. The specimens that I have seen of the amyg
daloid consist of a basis of a sort of iron-clay containing al
mond-shaped portions of calc spar and green earth.
     With regard to the point at issue between Mr. Farey and me,
it would be a most unprofitable waste of time to dissect his ses
quipedalian sentences, and to answer each part separately: I
shall content myself with stating, that after reading Mr. Farey's
letter, I referred to the original account of Mr. Strachey in the
Philosophical Transactions, on the coal-pits near the Mendip
Hills, and find the unconformable position of the red ground is-
most distinctly mentioned both in his section and description; so
that the merit of having first observed this appearance belongs
neither to Mr. Farey nor to myself, but exclusively to Mr. Strachey.
My ignorance of this circumstance arose from not having had an
opportunity, while writing my paper, of consulting the Philoso
phical Transactions themselves, but was obliged to content my
self with referring to Dr. Thomson's Abridgement, where the
particulars relative to the occurrence of the coal are accurately
given, but .this point of the unconformable position of the red
ground is altogether omitted.
XXXIV. On        the Strength   of Beams.     By A Correspondent.
                            To   Mr. Tillnch.
          B
Sir,— uffon found by his experiments, that the strength of
beams decreased in a much quicker proportion than the inverse
ratio of their lengths.     Tlte cause has not been satisfactorily ex
plained ; but may it not be accounted for by the tendency of the
weight to compress the beam, in the direction of its depth, at
 the place of fracture ?     To ascertain the effect of this kind of
pressure, I   fixed  one end  of a bar of deal   | of an inch square,
and suspended a weight of 1 7 lbs . at 12 inches distance from the
  !.                                                              point

point of support.   After it had remained in this state about half
an hour, without being any more depressed than it was five mi
nutes after the weight was laid on, 1 subjected the fixed end to
a considerable pressure, and the depression increased in propor
tion to the pressure, and ultimately the bar was broken without
any additional weight at the other end.     The experiment was
repeated with the same results.
 . When a beam is supported in the middle,    and a weight sus
pended   at each end ; the weights and the extending forces are
to each other as BD : AB ; the compressing forces will be nearly,
                                                     B
if not exactly, equal to the extending forces, because there is -a
considerable degree of pressure transmitted to the lower part of
the beam D, by the exertion of the parts of the upper side to
retain their rectilineal position. Now the effect of the extending
forces to compress the beam is measured by BE, and this force
is resisted by the compressing forces AD, and A D, and by the
support at D : therefore, BD : BE : : W (= the weight at A or
       BE.W
A')         , equal the force compressing the beam at B ; and
        BD
the strength          of the beam        is inversely as this pressure.
     L = the length, D = the depth, B = the breadth, and

It is obvious the curvature is exactly the same in both cases.    If
I do not mistake, this imaginary experiment is the same with
the uniform curvature of your correspondent.     But it is evident,
that when we say the deflexion is as the square of the length,
we do not suppose the weight to have been varied^ but it was
varied as the length, that the strain might remain the same :
therefore, the deflexion is as the length and weight. Hence the
deflexion is as the length and weight when the curvature is the
same    ;   and the curvature will vary as the strain          :   therefore,
is as the deflexion.
   The deflexion of beams at the time of fracture, when the-
depth is very small in proportion to the length, is subject to se
veral irregularities : there is one which I do no recollect having
seen noticed, that       the sliding of the ends of the beams on
                          is,
the supports this motion sometimes gives such a momentum to
                :
the weight, that the beam breaks with a much less weight than
it would have done had the deflexion been gradually increased.
 .  In practice, where we wish the deviation from the natural po
sition to be as small as possible, the rule given for the stiffness
of beams will be found as correct as the nature of the subject
will admit of.                                                 *

XXXV.      Observations upon the different Hypotheses                   that have
 .   been proposed respecting the     Nature of Light.               By WiLLiAftf
     C»ane, Jan. M.D.       Boston^    Lincolnshire*,
By      light, we are enabled to distinguish the objects that sur
 round us; to view the beauties of creation, and to determined
 the pleasing vicissitude of day and night.             When mankind first
 turned their attention to philosophical pursuits ; to account for,
 and understand the various changes that are continually taking
place on the globe which they inhabit, and the heavens sur
 rounding it; One of their earliest inquiries was to attempt the
discovery of that agent which enabled thein to perceive these!
phaenomena ; an ageht which, after the lapse of centuries, and
the exertions of the greatest philosophers that have appeared,
still remains to be discovered.               Empedocles and Plato rank
amongst     the   earliest  philosophers     that  treat upon this subject.
They supposed vision to be occasioned by particles flying off
from the object seen, and meeting with others that proceeded
from the eye. This crude conjecture, unsupported by argument
or experiment, was soon rejected, and another advanced by Py
thagoras, who maintained that particles were emitted from the
body that became luminous, and entered the pupil of the eye ;
a doctrine which still holds a place in the writings of many phi
losophers of the present day.            Aristotle appears to be one of the
first that considered light and heat not to be the same.            Light he
imagined     to  be  the  act  of  a  transparent   substance  considered  as
such,   and'  not  arising   from    any  matter    proceeding from the lu
minous body: — this idea of Aristotle's gave rise to the Cartesif rt
doctrine.      In this hypothesis it was considered that light waS
Only   a  property    of the luminous body, exciting a clear and vivid
sensation in the observer; or that an invisible fluid was every-.
where present, and set in motion by an ignited body, or other'
iheans, to make objects visible.              Nearly similar to this. is the
doctrine of Huygens, who conceived that light was a subtile
elastic fluid filling all space, and rendering bodies visible by the
undulations into which it is thrown.               According to him, whert
the sun rises it agitates this fluid ; the undulations gradually ex
tend themselves, and at last striking against the eye cause us to
perceive the sun.         As this hypothesis has occupied the atten
tion of philosophers more than any other, except Newton's, we
shall state the objections to      it,     after having noticed what Df4
Young     has  said   on   the   same    subject.    Euler was     strenuous
                                                                     a
advocate in favour        of  this   opinion   of Huygens     but appears to

have been unable to support        it       against the theory of Newton.

196       Observations upon the different HypotJieses
This great philosopher, no       less celebrated and revered for the
superior powers of his mind than for the modesty with which
he gave his opinion on any subject, supposed light not to be
a fluid per se, but that it was projected from the luminous body
with an immense velocity in all directions, consisting of a great
number of very small particles, and always proceeding in right
lines, until they were turned from that path by some particular
cause.     Several objections have been brought against this opi
nion of Newton's, as will be presently noticed.        But in the first
place  let  us  turn our attention   to the Huygenian theory, or more
properly its modification by Dr. Young in his Bakerian Lecture
for 1802. The Doctor observes, 1 st, That a luminiferous ether
pervades the universe, rare and elastic in a high degree.        2dly,
Undulations are excited in this ether whenever a body becomes
luminous.      3dly, The sensation of different colours depends
on the frequency of vibrations excited by light in the retina.
4thly, All material bodies have an attraction for the ethereal me
dium, by which it is accumulated within their substance, and for
a small distance around them, in a state of greater density, and
not of greater elasticity.        Dr. Young first quotes several pas
sages  from    Newton's   works,   to prove that Newton himself had
recourse to an extremely elastic and subtile medium, which re,
fleets and refracts light by fits of easy transmission ; that tins
medium is far more elastic, rare, and active than air.     He then
proceeds to prove that the undulations of this elastic medium are
light ; and in his 9th prop, he states, that radiant light con
sists in undulations of the luminous ether.
    To this hypothesis of Dr. Young's there appear to be many
objections, and some of them, I am inclined to think, almost in
surmountable.     Newton has stated very clearly, " that a pressure
on a fluid medium, i. e. a motion propagated by such a medium
beyond any obstacle which impedes any part of its motion, can
 not be propagated in right lines, but will be always inflecting
 itself every way to the quiescent medium beyond that obstacle."
 He further adds,
                   " The waves, pulses or vibrations of the air,
 wherein sound consists, are manifestly inflected, though not so
 considerably as the waves of water; and sounds are propagated
 with equal ease through crooked tubes as through straight lines;
 but light was never known to move in any curve, nor to inflect
 itself ad umlram." In reply to this objection Dr. Young ob
 serves, " Sounds are propagated through crooked passages, be
 cause their sides are capable -of reflecting sound, just as light
 would be propagated through a bent tube if perfectly polished."
 The statement in the latter part of this passage can carry but
little weight with  it, as it   merely an assumption.
                                is                       Sound,      it
is  well known, passes with ease through        atube consisting of
                                                                 many

                    especting the Nature   of Light.                 197
 many spiral turns, but experiments prove directly the contrary
 with respect to light.      It may be said that it is for want of the
 tubes having a due polish : but we know that straight metallic
 tubes which are highly polished reflect light in great quantity,
 and with great ease, but cannot reflect it so as to cause it to
 pass through them when they are curved.          If light consists of a
 series of undulations, it is difficult to conceive how we could
 perceive objects clearly and distinctly : from what we observe
 with respect to bodies thrown into a state of vibration, as when
 a musical chord is struck, it almost appears impossible that the
 edges of bodies should be distinctly seen.       Again, if light de
 pended on the undulations of this ethereal medium, caused by
 the vibrations of the luminous body, as stated by Dr. Young
when he accounts for the phaenomena of solar phosphori — why
does not light always accompany sound ? For the sounding body
not merely imparts its vibrations to the air, but also to fluids
 and the most solid bodies.
    It is therefore difficult to conceive that an elastic subtile fluid
should not also partake of this vibratory motion ; particularly as
it is a fluid capable of being affected by a very slight cause so
as to produce light, as when light is perceived by means of
many pyrophori ; yet the loudest tones are not accompanied
with light. And on the contrary, the most intense light has not
the least effect on the ear, although this beautiful organ is truly
formed to convey the slightest vibrations to the sensorium.
When we contemplate the mechanism of the ear, we find an
organ formed so as to convey any vibratory motion ; but the eye
is a piece of mechanism entirely different, and appears but badly
calculated to propagate tremors.          These observations appear
to be in direct opposition to what might be expected if light
consisted in the undulation or vibration of a highly elastic me
dium.      In short, the very existence of such a medium is entirely
gratuitous. The same objections also hold good against the
opinion advanced by Malbranche ; who suppose^ that there
was an analogy between sound and light, and that bodies ap»
peared more or less luminous according to the vibrations of a
subtile matter between the eye and the object, which matter was
put into motion by the rapidity with which the particles of the
body moved.
    In the latter part of the lecture Dr. Young accuses Sir Isaac
Newton of want of candour towards Huygens, which we may
here notice, in endeavouring to account for the singular refrac
tion of the Iceland crystal.      There are several passages in the
writings of this great man, which will show that the Doctor has
fallen into an error on this subject.      Newton expressly states in
his 28th query, at the end of his Treatise on Optics,
                                                             " That to
                                 N 3                            explain

    198         Observations upon the different Hypotheses
    explain the unusual refraction of the Iceland crystal by pression
    or motion propagated, has not been hitherto attempted, to my
,
    knowledge, except by Huygens, who for that end supposed two
    several vibrating mediums within that crystal.       But when he
    tried the refraction in two successive pieces of that crystal, and
    found them such as is above mentioned, he confessed himself
    at a loss for explaining them."            In his 25th query, he also
    states,  " Are there not other original properties of the rays of
    light, besides those already described ? An instance of another
    original property is the refraction of Iceland crystal, described
    first by Erasmus Bartoline, and afterwards more exactly by
    Huygens."      Sir Isaac then gives his own opinion, which, being
    well known, need not be repeated.           Indeed, with respect to the
    Iceland crystal, Huygens was himself by no means satisfied with
    his own views upon this subject : he observes in his Tractus
    de Lumine, page 67, when treating upon its double refraction,
    "  Quo artem pacto id fiat, nihil reperire potui, quod mihi satis-
    faceret."    Also Haiiy in his Natural Philosophy gives the pre
    ference to Newton's explanation.          He states*: " The theory of
    Huygens," alluding to his theory of double refraction,
                                                                     " which
    in general agrees with this mode of viewing the matter, is con
    nected in another way with an hypothesis not at all natural, re
    specting the elliptical figure of the waves of light, to which this
    great man attributes the refraction of aberration ; and he him
    self acknowledges his difficulty to reconcile with this hypothesis
    the result of observations made with two rhomboids, in which
    the rays sometimes merely change their functions, and some
    times are subdivided anew, in passing from one rhomboid into
    another." — " We are much more disposed to range ourselves here
    again on the side of Newton, when we consider the extreme sim
    plicity of the law admitted by this celebrated geometrician for
    the refraction of the ray aberration."          In short, so many diffi
    culties present themselves with respect to the undulating doc
    trine, that I am inclined to think it ought to be entirely aban
     doned.
        Having thus given a rapid view of the objections to the Car
     tesian doctrine and its modifications, let us turn our attention to
     that proposed by Sir Isaac Newton, which is, in fact, a modifi
    cation of the Pythagorean.          By this philosopher light is sup
    posed   to consist of  particles  emitted    from the luminous body in
     every direction.    The  first  objection   is, that as the rays of light
    pass from every part of a luminous body, they must interfere
     and destroy each other    ;  or that perception must become con
     fused, and objects be represented indistinctly. Canton has removed
                  9   Dr. Gregory's Trans. of Haii/s Nat. Phi(.

                            respecting the Nature              of Light.             .   199
this, by supposing-          a small instant         of time to take place between
the emission       of each particle of light that             passes off in the same
 direction^ which is by no means a crude supposition ; for, as
the impression of light does certainly remain for a short space
of time on the retina, it is easy to conceive that there must                             b,e
an interval between two particles of light entering the eye       for,              ;
if  the impression of the second particle of light were to affect the
eye before the first had ceased, a confused vision must ensue,
from that organ being affected with several impressions at the
same time.      Chevalier D'Arcy has attempted to prove that the
sensation of     particle of light will remain for the seventh part
                   a
of   a second; and this,           by
                                 computing the velocity with whic,h
light  moves,  will give  an  interval of 20,000 miles between two
particles of light.      But as have not seen the original paper
                                        I
written       by
              D'Arcy, which          to be found in the Academy of
                                           is
Sciences for 1765,        do not know upon what experiments he
                             I
makes the above estimation.         That the impression lasts the in
terval he mentions           correct estimate,
                              is
                              a                 am inclined to think,
                                                               I
from an experiment         made with a stick having its point made
                               1
red hot.     When the stick made less than eight revolutions in
 oae second, the circle of light was not perfect, but appeared to
 consist of a series of luminous points extremely near to each
other,
 I       have stated above, that the impression                      of light according
to   D'Arcy continues for the seventh part of            second, whicha
is  taken from Dr. Hutton's Mathematical Dictionary.             But Dr.
 Brewster in his edition of Ferguson's Astronomy, vol. ii., says,
 " appears from the accurate experiments of D'Arcy, that the
    It
 impression of light upon the retina continues two minutes and
forty seconds." Which of these two respectable writers             right,      is
 respecting the estimation made                 by
                                     D'Arcy, am unable to state I                         ;
 hut it appears to me, from the experiment just mentioned, that
 Dr. Hutton's        the most correct statement.
                       is                                 We may also
 observe,      the impression remained for so long
              if                                            time as two    a
 minutes and forty seconds, that upon shutting out the light                              in
 the day-time, or extinguishing     a lighted body,          room would    a
 not appear so instantaneously dark, but objects would remain for
a  short time visible.
    The second objection       that  is, there be such a constant
                                                     if
 emission of particles from luminous bodies, they would             short
                                                                               in

 time be much wasted, and therefore the stars ought to decrease
 and the bulk of the planets increase.      This objection Di'.Hors.-
 ley has  endeavoured to remove                      by
                                        first proving that the sun
                                                ;
 and stars receive mutually     great quantity of light from each

200          Observations. vpon the different Hypotheses
years the sun would lose only the 1 3 fa , part of the matter it
now contains.      From hence it is evident, that no diminution in
the one or increase in the size of the other can as yet, or ever
will be, perceived.     Dr. Priestley also, when reasoning upon an
experiment    made   by Mitchell, respecting the force of light, has
calculated   " that in the space of 6,000 years there would be
only 670 lbs. of the matter of light issue from the sun.         But
littie reliance however can be placed upon a calculation founded
upon such an experiment ; as it is very likely the motion ob
tained by Mitchell in his machine might be owing to the rare
faction of the air at that point where the rays of light were
collected into a focus producing a stream sufficiently strong to
put in motion so delicate a piece of machinery.         The quantity
of heat too, he observes, was so great as to warp the piece of
copper considerably, and almost to melt it; and this would also
tend to produce motion, by altering in some measure the centre
of gravity of the instrument.        In the third place, it has been
supposed that the amazing velocity with which the particles of
light must move, would, although almost inconceivably minute,
have a force exceeding that of a cannon ball.         This also Dr.
 Horsley has ingeniously answered: and he not only proves that
the force'of a particle of light would not be equal to a cannon
shot, but that it will when emitted from the sun, and received
 directly on the eye, on a bright day, not exceed the force of a
shot a quarter of an inch in diameter, moving at the rate of sixteen
inches in a year; or in short, the force is less than can be
imagined. The celebrated Euler also maintained, that if light
were material, its velocity would disturb the motion of the pla
nets.    But this is an objection which may also be urged against
the doctrine of vibration : for how could the planets move steadily
in the midst of a medium that is perpetually in a state of vibra
tion ? This philosopher further urged, that if light consisted of
particles passing in straight lines ; then those bodies through
which it passes must consist of right-lined canals in all direc
tions, and that such a structure would deprive transparent bodies
 of all solidity and coherence amongst their parts.        This upon
 investigation does not appear so strong an objection as at first
 sight. Indeed it is by no means improbable, though undoubtedly
 hypothetical, that transparent substances have their molecular or
atoms so arranged as to form right- lined canals.
    The discoveries made in chemistry since the time of Euler,
 clearly prove that the ultimate particles of matter are not in ab
 solute contact.    The expansion and contraction of bodies by the
 aid of heat sufficiently show this.
    Lavoisier, in the first chapter of his Elements of Chemistry,
 observes, when treating upon heat, « that the particles of
                                                               bodies

                      respecting the Nature                  of Light.             291
bodies do not touch     each other in any state hitherto known;
which, though a very singular conclusion, is yet impossible to be
denied."    And Newton in his Optics, part iiu book ii. prop. B,
appears to have entertained a similar idea; for he says, *' A con
cave Sphere of gold filled with water, and soldered up, has,
upon pressing the sphere with great force, let water squeeze
through    it,and stand on all its outside     multitudes of small
                                                                in
drops, like dew, without bursting or cracking the gold, as have                I
been informed from an eye witness.        From all which we may
conclude, that gold has more pores than solid parts, and                            by
consequence that water has above forty times more pores than
parts." And he further adds, " that he who shall find out an
hypothesis       by
                which water may be so rare, and yet not capable
of compression         by
                     force, may doubtless                      by
                                              the same hypothesis
make gold and water, and all other bodies, as much rarer as he
pleases, so that light may find a ready passage through trans
parent substances."      Hence, as     appears that even the most
                                                it
solid body  isporous,       not, think, too hypothetical to sup
                            it   is        I
pose that the particles of matter may be differently arranged in
different bodies and that those bodies which are transparent, or
                      ;
transmit light freely, may have their atoms so arranged as to
form an indefinite series of right-lined canals; which      effected      is
by  these atoms having for each other        certain degree of po

larity.
    Crystallization, which affords the most transparent bodies,                      is
a  strong argument in favour of this supposition.           If were not  it
for some peculiar arrangement of the particles of a crystal, how
can we account for the same substance always assuming a de
terminate form upon going from            fluid to  a   solid state  a  So     ?
correctly does this take place, that       we   are   able   in many   in
stances to determine the composition,                         by
                                                  knowing the form Of
the crystal of the subject under examination.            The only means
of accounting for this regularity                       by
                                             supposing that the parti
                                                is
cles of matter composing the crystal, have with respect to each
other  a  certain polarity.            only upon this principle that
                                          It   is
many of the phaenomena of magnetism can be at all explained.
For how otherwise can the fragments of                 magnet instantly
                                                                    a
observe a polarity; and magnets, which have been struck                              by
lightning, or     byhaving the electric shock passed through them,
have their poles changed        An instance
                                      ?             recorded ofis   ship's     a
 compass being struck        by
                            lightning, ever afterwards turning east
 and west.     Perhaps in this case the poles of the atoms forming
 the needle were turned so as to lie transversely instead of longi
 tudinally.
    To account for bodies being opaque, according to this hypo
 thesis, we have only to observe, that        such bodies the particles
                                                        in

   are promiscuously arranged, if such an expression may.be a^
   lowed ; or that they attract the light they receive with a degree
   of force so as not to allow it to pass through. In the -first case
  it would be reflected, in the latter absorbed; and lastly, it is
  both transmitted and reflected, by those particles of light being
  reflected which fall upon the moleeuta themselves, and by those
  passing through which fall in the direction of the canals through
  which it is transmitted.
      By the term absorption, used as above, will be understood
  light combining chemically with the substance which is exposed
  to it; and hence, when a body gives out light, it is acted upon by
  some chemical agent, such as is observed in combustion, &c.
  An exception to this observation, at first, appears in those ani
  mals which are phosphorescent, and have the property of emitting
  a great quantity of light; but this is probably owing to sonie
. chemical change taking place in the animal, in a similar man
  ner as we observe carbon to be emitted from the lungs by
  means of the organs of respiration.      From what has been ad
  vanced it therefore appears, that, of the two theories, the one
  adopted by Newton is the more applicable to the phaenomena
 of light.
   By many philosophers heat and light have been considered
only as modifications of each other. A concise history of the
opinions upon this subject may be seen in Dr. Frank's Treatise
on the Theories of Chemistry*.      It has also been advanced, that
heat is only the effect of a vibratory motion amongst the parti
cles of the body that is heated, and that light is only heat in a
state of radiation.    If this were the case, we should expect
to find that the point of greatest illumination in the prismatic
spectrum should also be the hottest : the contrary of which is
shown by Herschel in his experiments on the prism.         Also the
focus of light and focus of heat ought to be the same ; but Dr.
 Herschel has likewise shown that these differ, and his experi
 ments are further confirmed by those made      Sir Henry Engle-
                                                          toy
field. Sir Henry observes, in the account he gives of his ex-
perimentsf, that " Mr. Cary, optician in the Strand, and Dr.
 Hunter, were present at these experiments, and repeatedly saw
the thermometer sink when carried into the light, and rise again
when carried into the dark. Dr. Hunter also received the focus
on the palm of his hand, where the heat was sensibly felt; and
shutting his eyes, and pointing with      long pen to where the
                                                     a
heat was greatest, he always touched his hand beyond the visible
light." As another objection,      may be observed, that phos

  mosphere in which they are placed.             And further, many sub
  stances are capable of attaining a very high degree of tempera
  ture, and becoming highly attenuated, (as for example, when
  water is converted into steam,) without emitting the least degree
  of light.    Heat passes through all bodies, with greater or less
  facility; whereas light only passes through those bodies which
  are termed transparent: — and many substances that transmit
  light very freely, are at the same time very bad conductors of
  heat.     Hence it would appear, that heat and light are two di
  stinct agents.     Whether light be a fluid, or only a property of
  matter, or consists of an innumerable quantity of small particles
  emitted from     a luminous      body, remains   yet to be determined.
  The phaenomena of light appear to admit of the best explana
  tion, according to the latter supposition; and the late discovery
  of Malus, respecting light having a polarity, may be adduced as
  another argument in its favour.                                      . /
  XXXVI. On Correcting             the Rate   of an Electric Clock   by a
               Compensation      for Changes of Temperature.
                           By F. Ronalds, Esq.
                                To  Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir, — Having         at different intervals, since my communication
  to you   in April last, made fresh attempts to render Mr. De Luc's
  column applicable to the measure of time, and being now obliged
  to discontinue them by a long absence from London, permit me
  to describe that which has been most successful, in the hope that
  some person better qualified for the subject may deem it worthy
  of attention.
      I have, by the following method, procured a better compensa
   tion for the effect of an increase of temperature, which, by in
   creasing the power of the column, accelerates the velocity of the
   vibrations.
      A beam is suspended like a dipping needle, as nearly as pos
  sible in its centre of gravity, carrying at one end the clock, and
  at the other a weight almost counterpoizing it.          A spirit ther-
. mometer     of nearly   the  same   kind  as  those used  in France (to
  mark the degree of heat by an index) is placed under the beam ;
  the part containing the spirit is 35 inches long, and one inch
  bore, and the part~which contains in its lower end the mercury
  is half an inch bore.       A small ivory rod and piston sliding very
  freely  in the latter  tube   rests upon the surface of the mercury,
  and sustains at its upper end the preponderating weight of that
                                                                      arni

  arm of the balance which carries the clock.              Two flat plates of
  brass (four  inches   long  and   one  inch  in  breadth) insulated and
 connected with the opposite extremities of the columns are
 placed at such distances, viz. about one inch from the ball of
 the pendulum, which is also insulated, that it vibrates between
 them by the joint forces of gravitation and electric attraction in
 half seconds; and they are inclined to such angles with the
 pendulum, that the degree of heat, which causes the columns to
 act more powerfully, at the same time, by expanding the spirit,
 raises the piston, the beam, and the pendulum into a position
 where the vibrations of the latter are proportionally longer ; and
 consequently, these two different effects of heat are thus made
 to compensate each other; and the instrument actually keeps to
 lerably good' time : — how long it will continue to do so, must
 depend upon the constancy of the columns.                But the regularity
 and steadiness of the vibrations are also much improved by en
 veloping the columns in cement, which was laid on in a liquid
 state, so that no moisture can be driven out of the squares of pa
 per, and by the ball or bob (which is of brass, with a fine gold
 girth,) being very considerably heavier than those of cork or thin
.silver which I had hitherto employed.
     I believe the principal defects are now those arising from a
 difference between the rates of heating and cooling of the spirit
 thermometer and the columns, and from some unknown circum
 stance which has been attributed to the electric state of the
 ambient air. The larger the series employed, and the heavier
 the pendulum, the more correctly it seems to vibrate*.
     Amongst other interesting intelligence from your learned cor
 respondent M. Van Mons, it appears that Sign. Zamboni has
been enabled to produce strong sparks and shocks by the co
 lumn, the construction of which he seems to have thus very
greatly improved.         With the help of a condenser I have advan
 tageously substituted it for the electrophorus in Volta's inflam
mable air-lamp, which is apt to get out of order; but Sign. Zam-
boni's columns could be used without this assistance.

XXXVII.    On tlie Fracture        of Electrical Jars by spontaneous
          Discharges.    By        Mr. Thomas Howldy.
                         To       Mr. Tillock.
Sir, —-The      perforation or fracture of Leyden jars, which some
times    takes place when they explode spontaneously, and at
other times when they are intentionally discharged, is a phee-
nomenon which has often obtruded itself upon the notice of
electricians;  and yet, so far as I can learn, its cause has not
been investigated with much care.         My attention was forcibly
attracted to this subject a few years since, by the following cir
cumstance: — A small electrical battery of nine jars, that had been
charged pretty 4iigh, exploded spontaneously at the moment
when I was going to discharge it.        On examining the jars after
the explosion, it was found that three of them had been per
forated nearly in the middle between the top and bottom of the
coating. The jars of this battery were four inches in diameter
and twelve high, having uncoated margins two inches broad.
As I was not then aware that similar accidents had occurred to
other experimenters, and as I had never before had more than
one jar broken by any single explosion of the battery, I was
greatly surprised at the fracture of three on this occasion, and
could not account for it in any manner satisfactory to myself.
The most plausible conjecture that I was able to form concern
ing its cause was, that the communication between the charging
wires and the inside coatings of the jars was not sufficiently
extensive; so that, when the discharge of the battery was made,
the whole charge of each jar, rapidly converging to the single
and very limited point of contact between its coating and the
charging wire, experienced a proportionate condensation and
resistance on entering  it,  which caused a momentary retarda
tion of its velocity, and consequently       amomentary reaction of
the charge from that point against the sides of the jars which;
reaction, when the charge had considerable intensity, might be
sufficient to burst one or more of them.
 I    determined, therefore, to make some experiments with the
least injured of the fractured jars, in order to ascertain the pro
bability or improbability of this conjecture.    With this intention
I  removed the damaged jars from the battery; and finding that
one of them was simply perforated without having any lateral
cracks extending from the hole,      I took from round   itnearly an
inch in breadth both of the exterior and interior coating, and;
made each side of the glass perfectly clean.       The jar was then
placed directly below the ball and wire at the extremity of the
                                                                  prime

 206              On the Fracture    of Electrical Jafs
  prime conductor     of the electrical machine, one end of a chain
  being   annexed  to the wire, while the other end of it descended
 into the jar and came in contact with the middle of its bottom,
  so that the suspended part of the chain was at equal distances
 from the opposite sides of the jar.        The chain was thus con
 nected with the bottom only of the inside coating, in order that the
 jar might be charged and discharged as nearly as possible under
 the same circumstances as when it was in the battery; the jars
 of Which have their charging wires in communication with the
 interior coating at the bottom of each, and nowhere else.            The
jar being disposed     as described  above, the  object of the first   ex
 periment     was  to ascertain how many turns of the wheel were
 necessary to make it explode spontaneously through the per
 foration in its side.
      Exp. 1. —The wheel being turned, on completing its eighth
 revolution an explosion took place through the perforation in
 the jar.    The charge with which the jar exploded through the
 perforation being thus known, I now wished to communicate to
 it the greatest charge it would bear without so exploding ; in
 order that the jar might be discharged in the usual way, and
that I might observe at 'the moment of its discharge whether
 any appearance worthy of notice would occur at the perfora
tion.
      Exp. 2. — The jar was next charged by something more than
seven turns    of the wheel ; one ball of an insulated discharging
 rod was then put in contact with its exterior coating at the
 same height as the perforation, and at about three inches di
 stance from it : on making the other ball of the rod approach
the ball communicating with the inside of the jar, a vivid spark
was seen to pass between the two balls, and at the same mo
ment a similar spark with respect to brilliancy and strength was
likewise seen to pass between the interior and exterior coatings
of the jar through the perforation in its side. Although the re*
suit of this experiment seemed to confirm my conjecture as to
the cause of the bursting of the jars before related, yet it oc
curred to me that possibly the spark through the perforation
might have been occasioned by the mode in which the jar had
been . discharged : to ascertain this, the jar was repeatedly
charged as in Exp. 2, and was afterwards discharged by putting
one ball of the discharging rod in contact at different times with
different parts of its exterior coating, more or less distant from
the perforation ; and by bringing the other ball either more
slowly or more quickly towards the ball communicating with the
inside of the jar ; but in all these instances the same phaeno-
mena occurred.       Two sparks were always seen to pass simulta
neously ; one between the two balls, and the other between the
    .   ;                                                            tWO

tw6 coatings of the jar through the perforation in its side. Being
now satisfied that the latter spark did not depend on the mode
in which the discharge was effected, I proceeded to connect the
upper part of the inside coating of the jar in six different points
with the chain, by means of three pieces of metallic wire placed
in the jar diameterwise, their opposite ends pressing somewhat
stiffly against its opposite sides.   The jar was then charged and
discharged twice, as before ; and at each discharge the spark
again occurred at the perforation without any sensible difference
in its appearance : but on attempting to repeat the experiment
the third time, the charge exploded before it had arrived at its
former intensity; and on examining the perforation there were
now found several fractures proceeding from               it,
                                                      through one or
other of which the jar, during every succeeding attempt to
charge    it,
            continued to explode     notwithstanding
                                        ;               several expe
dients were employed to prevent it. The jar having thus be
come unable to retain a charge sufficient for the purpose in
 view, and the other damaged ones appearing to be so fractured'-
 as to forbid any attempt to employ them,          was unable to pro

ceed further in the inquiry, and obliged to rest satisfied with
 having ascertained the following facts          :
     1. That when a Leyden jar, under the circumstances already

                is            certain height, and then discharged
                                a
in  the usual way, — the charge will separate or divide itself into
 two portions, one of which will pass through the metallic me
 dium employed to produce the discharge          while the other por
                                                      ;
tion will pass from one coating of the jar to the other, through
 the perforation in its side.

 mode of discharge        by
                         which sparka      elicited at the ball of the
                                                 is
charging wire.
    3. That when the charging wire communicates in several
points with the upper part of the coating, all other circumstances
remaining the same, the separation of the charge still ensues      ;
and the ratio of its separated portions to each other experiences
 no sensible alteration.
    Should future experiments show that this phaenomenon de
pends on the limited and imperfect communication with the         in
side of the jar,      would afford information
                     it                            of much practical
usefulness.    If, on the contrary,    should be found to be wholly
                                            it
 independent of that circumstance, the investigation of its cause
 would still be interesting, as its discovery would perhaps throw
 additional light upon the other singular phaenomena of the Ley
 den jar.     These considerations, together witli the uncertainty
 whether  I  may hereafter have the opportunity and means of re-
surning and completing the inquiry, have induced me to lay         it

209               flew Outlines of Chemical Philosophy;
 before your readers in its present imperfect state, and to taktf
 the liberty of suggesting the following hints for its further prose
 cution. — Three jars of equal electrical capacity with one another
 might be taken, and a hole full a quarter of an inch in diameter be
 drilled in each. One of them should have the hole near the top of
 its coating ; the second jn its middle ; and the third near its bot
tom.     The holes being of this size and the glass tolerably thick,
the explosions would pass through them from coating to coating
without injury to the jars.         If,
                                  however, stronger charges should
be required than might with safety to the jars be employed in
this manner, the coating round the holes might be removed to                                a
greater distance, and two wires having        small ball on one ex
                                                       a
tremity of each might be connected with the opposite coating*
of the jars the opposing balls being placed at small distance
             ;                                                       a
from each other and opposite the centre of the holes          the ex         :
plosions might then be made to pass through them from ball to
ball without acting on the glass, and the experiments might be
repeated as often as necessary without fear of damaging the jars.
Cuthbertson's balance electrometer would likewise be useful for
regulating with accuracy the strength of the charges. —         series           A
of experiments made with each jar separately, and another series
with the jars combined, under every variety of circumstance
which might influence the results, would,             probable, add

    The apparatus that 1 make use of for excitation is a barome
ter  tube only 3-10ths of an inch i'n diameter, and a silk hand
kerchief; but these low electrical states require a'very perfect
mode of insulation.        The material generally used for this pur
pose is glass ; but this is known to be a conductor in some de
gree, and to remove this inconvenience, varnish and sealing-wax
have been'used.       But as these do not render glass a perfect non
conductor, some more perfect mode of insulation is necessarvwhen     '
low degrees of electricity are the objects of investigation.
    1 have frequently     made use of thermometer tubes, because
they contain less surface than the glass rods generally used; but
these only lessen the inconvenience, without removing it.
   White flint glass contains much lead; whence I supposed that
green-bottle glass might be better for this purpose, because it
contains no metal, and a hint to this effect is given in these
Outlines*. How far my supposition was well founded will ap
pear from the following experiments :
    Exp. 9.— »1. Having fixed two slips of Dutch gold-leaf to the
end of a thermometer tube ten inches long, I suspended it in
the axis of an open-necked bell-glass, by means of sealing-wax ;
one-half of the tube being within the glass, and the other half
above it. — 2. A solid stick of green-bottle glass, seven inches
long, and about the same thickness as the thermometer tube
rhentioned above, was fitted up in the same maimer.
    The excited barometer tube being held over the top of the
Stick of bottle glass, at the distance of an inch, the leaves di
verged to an angle of about 30 degrees ; but the effect was trans
ient, the leaves soon collapsed.
    The barometer tube, without receiving any further excitement,
was then held over the top of the thermometer tube of flint glass,
at the same distance as before ; the leaves gradually diverged to
 an angle of more than 100 degrees, and continued electrified for
 30 hours.
    From these experiments we may infer, that green-bottle glass
is greatly preferable to flint glass for insulation, aud maybe sub
stituted for it in many parts of an electrical apparatus.
    A thermometer tube seven inches long, having its surface uni
formly covered with black sealing-wax to the thickness of l-10th
 of an inch, is still a conductor ; and when compared with a so
 lid stick of green-bottle glass of the same dimensions, their con
 ducting powers appear nearly equal, — but with this difference,
 the green glass conducts electricity much slower                 than the
  other f.

210          New Outlines       of Chemical Philosophy      .
  A stick of black   sealing-wax is the best non-conductor of any
substance that I have examined, but it is far from being perfect.
It may, however, be used with advantage in many electrical ex
periments, though not in such as require perfect insulation.
   As a perfect insulating stand is a valuable part of an electrical
apparatus, and as all the materials just mentioned were found
to be conductors, I was induced to try what effect might be pro
duced by combining glass and sealing-wax.        1 took a thermo
meter tube nine inches long, and joined it to a glass foot, like
the foot of a wine-glass, with black sealing-wax.     Upon the top
of this tube a stick of sealing-wax an inch and a half in length
and half an inch thick is fixed, having a circular piece of plate-
glas,s three inches in diameter fixed horizontally upon the top
of it. The upper surface of this glass js gilt with gold-leaf, and
upon its centre one end of a slip of Dutch leaf is fixed with gum
water.     This serves as an index or electroscope ; for, as soon as
the gilt surface of the glass cap is charged, this index stands
erect, being repelled equally on every side by the charged sur
face of the cap.
   The perfection of this stand, as a non-conductor, was proved
thus:
  The wire upon the top of one of my best electrometers was
                                                                          .    ;
applied to the glass foot of the stand, and then to the thermo
meter tube fixed upon     it,
                            without the least effect being produced
upon   the Dutch leaves: but as soon as the electrometer was brought
near the cap the leaves began to diverge    ;   and on coming into
contact, either with the under or upper side of       it,
                                                       the leaves         in
stantly diverged to an angle of 90 degrees or more, according
to the height of the charge which the cap had received.
   In my fifth experiment, (Phil. Mag. vol.xliii. page 43Q,) which
was made to prove the permeability of glass           bythe electrical
elements, the neck of     a Florence flask was closed with an ani
mal substance communicating with the earth,           bywhich means
no electricity could enter the flask without passing through the
glass.
   The truth of this conclusion may be evinced        bymeans of the
following experiment.
   Exp. 10. — took the same flask mentioned in the fifth ex
              I
periment, and after having removed the animal membrane from
it,
  I   dipped the top of its neck and stopper into melted sealing-
wax,    by which means the neck of the flask was closed more com
pletely than if it had been hermetically sealed   ;  for    has been
                                                                it
proved in the preceding experiments, that sealing-wax           much is
                                                                      a
worse conductor than glass.
   An excited barometer tube being held over the top of the
ueck of the flask at  a  short distance, no effect was produced           in
                                                                   the

the localities mentioned, are found to belong to two different, and mostly -to
very distant Strata, in the series, aud in other instances, to three such strata

  The Species, which          I    conceive will require dividing, are as follows; viz.

    After the many pressing invitations which I have given in your
work, and elsewhere, to the free and candid examination and
correction of what I may have ventured to state, concerning the
Stratification of Britain, it may be almost superfluous to add,
that it would particularly gratify me, to see these lists of Shells,

XL, On Jameson's                 to Cuvier's Theory of the Earth.
                        Preface
Being       something of a Geologist, and possessing a high vena*
ration for the Bible, it was with no inconsiderable pleasure that
I read in the preface written by Professor Jameson to the trans
lation of Cuvier's admirable " Essav on the Theory of the Earth,"
some observations asserting that " the structure of the Earth, and
the mode of distribution of extraneous fossils or petrifactions, are so
many direct evidences of the Scripture account of the formation
of the Earth;" and that " even the periods of time, the six days
of Mosaic description, are not inconsistent with our theories of
the Earth."      If however, instead of leaving the reader to find
the precise points of agreement, the Professor had condescended
to explain them, he would, I conceive, have done service to the
community.       I have read the performance of Cuvier with much
interest, but without being able to discover the promised agree
ment.
    The researches of Geologists have within the last few years
caused many wonderful        discoveries.     They have found that a
certain class of rocks contain no animal or vegetable remains }
which therefore they term primitive, as having, in their estima
tion, been first created.   These are found beneath all other rocks,
 and upon them rest another class, by Werner called transition
Tocks, which contain only the remains of zoophytes ; the ani
mals which formed the first link in the chain of animated beings.
Upon the transition, lies another and more numerous class,
called floetx rocks; the older of which inclose the remains of
animals, which not being now found, are of course extinct; and
the newer of them, the remains of animals which approach, but
are not actually the same as those inhabiting the present seas J
 and the newest of them, as well as the alluvial formation, which
lies above them, contain the remains of animals not to be di
stinguished from those now existing.         The latter also inclose the
 bones of large land animals.
    But "it is quite undeniable that no human remains hare
 hitherto been discovered among the extraneous fossils" (page
 117) in any solid rock, which is not decidedly, both in respect
 of its situation and composition, of very late date.
    We have the authority of eminent Geologists for asserting that
 the. remains of animals are found in mountains ten and even
 fourteenf thousand feet above the level    of the sea. What amazing
 revolutions must have befallen the earth, to produce such ca
 tastrophes as have buried in mountains so elevated, the shells
 which once inhabited the ocean ! Geologists are not, 1 believe,
 generally inclined to consider this as the consequence of the uni*
     Vol. 46. No. 209. SepM815.             P                      versal

 226                     On Jdmeson*s Preface
 versal deluge ; nor does any thing in the Mosaic account of that
 Wonderful event, induce the necessary belief that any important
 change took place on the surface of the earth in consequence of
 it.     Indeed, had this been its effect, we should in all probability
have discovered the bones of men mingled with extraneous fos
 sils ; and since the bones of men have never been thus found, or
 even in alluvial soils in any considerable quantity, may we not
 reasonably infer that they were carried off by the retiring water,
 and that they lie buried in ocean ?
      It forms a question that continues greatly to puzzle some Geo
 logists, Why, if man inhabited the earth at the same time with
 those animals whose remains are found in such vast numbers, are
 not human bones found with them ? since there is nothing in
 their composition that should make them less enduring than
 those of other animals, as is amply testified by such as are
 found beneath the surface of the soil in ancient fields of battle,
 both in this and in other countries.
     But other Geologists are of opinion that some of those cata
 strophes, by which animal life suffered so greatly, and of which
 the remains actually constitute almost entire strata in certain cal
 careous mountains, actually took place before the earth was in
 habited by man ; —that other animals were created long before
him ;— and that the earth existed a long time previously to the
 creation of animals.     The following extracts will, as it seems to
me, show that these are the opinions of Cuvier.
     He speaks, p. 3, of the revolutions which took place "previ
ously to the existence of all nations."
     At p. 17, he says pointedly, — " there have not been alivays
living creatures on the earth."
     At p. 21, he says,   "It is impossible to deny that the waters
of the sea have formerly, and for a long time, covered those
masses of matter which now constitute our highest mountains ;
and further, that these waters did not support any living bodies."
     The concluding sentence of his Es9ay is as follows : " And man,
to whom only a short space is allotted upon earth, would have
the glory of restoring the history of thousands of ages which
preceded the history of his race, and of thousands of animals
that never were contemporaneous with his species."
     These quotations seem decisive of the opinions of Cuvier j
and it remains for Professor Jameson to show the agreement of
such opinions with the sense in which the words of Moses are
usually accepted : they appear to me exactly the reverse.
     There now lies beside me an edition of the Bible printed by
Baskett in 1767, in which, at the head of the first chapter of Ge
nesis, are these words, "Year before the common year of Christ,
4004," which I take it for granted means that we should con-
                                                          . .'   sider

                    to Cuvler's Theory   of the Earth.  .            227
Vider that as the period      of the Creation of the earth in comput
ing   its  age ; whence it follows that it is now 5819 years old ;
which is the c6mmon opinion.
    It follows, therefore, that the five first verses of the first chap
ter of Genesis are usually considered as including the work of the
 " first day" ; in which is comprehended the conception of an al
most simultaneous creation of the earth, supposing the day spo
ken of to be equal only to our natural day.
    If this be true, where were the "thousands of ages" alluded
to by Cuvier, as "preceding the history of the race of man?"
who, according to Moses, was created on the sixth day (in the
usual acceptation of his words) from the creation of the earth.
   Jameson explains the word "day" by a resort to the hypo
thesis of Bishop Horsley, that the motion of the earth may have
been slower at the time of its formation, than after it was formed.
This hypothesis is plausible, and maybe true; but we can by no
means     verify it.
   Let us attend to the words of Moses.
    "1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth.— 2.       And the earth was without form, and void; and
darkness was upon the face of the deep.          And the spirit of God
moved upon the face of the waters."
   On perusing and re-perusing the above, as well as the context,
often and with the utmost attention, I cannot persuade myself
that it is incumbent on us to include the whole of the facts re
corded in the five first verses, as necessarily comprehended in
the work of the first day; and though it is not for us to attempt
to unravel the great and sublime mysteries of creation, it seems
to me that we shall not be doing despite to the meaning of the
inspired writer, by declaring that
                                         " in the beginning God cre
                                     " and by making a pause, where
ated the heaven and the earth ;
he has concluded a sentence, by recording a fact.
    In this record there is no limit implied, except that the earth
was created "in the beginning," — nor is there in the succeeding
verse any limit implied, as to the length of time in which it con
tinued "without form, and void;" nothing by which we can pos
sibly deduce the conclusion that, in order to make up the exact
term of 5819 years, the earth has existed only the precise num
ber and duration of so many natural days as make up that num
 ber  of years.
    If we accept     the proffered hypothesis of slower revolution, we
 shall have a term totally undefined; it may comprehend the
 " thousands of ages " alluded to by Cuvier, greater in number
 than human thought can compass.
    But it seems probable that, however the hypothesis of slower
 revolution might apply to the time which I conceive to have
                                     P 2                            been

   228                    On Jameson's Preface
   been onty included in the Mosaic account of the six days of cre
  ation ; it cannot be philosophically applied to that term of time,
  after
        "  the beginning," in which the earth continued to be "with
  out form and void," and during which, "darkness was upon the
  face of the deep ;" because that time was before the great scheme
  of creation had been completed, — before the universe was fram
  ed — before the "two great lights" were "made." — Is it not
  probable that, while the earth continued in this state, it suffered
  no revolution at all ? — there was no day, nothing by which to
  measure the length of time during which it so existed. — How
 indeed shall the finite comprehension of man soar so high as to
 "the beginning?" by what means shall he ascertain its limit ?
     Surely it is far more reasonable, and even less presumptuous,
  to conclude that no limit was intended to be implied by Moses,
 in that term ; and simply to believe, that, the earth being with
 out form, and void, and in darkness, (without presuming to say
 how long it thus existed,) it pleased the Creator at a certain pe
 riod, and in his own good pleasure, that "his spirit should move
 upon the face of the waters," — that the "two great lights and
  the stars" should be "made," — and, in a word, that the uni
 verse should receive its impulse and its laws !
     And as the account of Moses declares that previously to the
 completion of the wonderful scheme of the universe, by the cre
 ation of the sun, the moon, and the stars,. the earth existed, how
 is it possible for us to assign a term for its duration in what may
thence be termed its isolated state ?      What reason is there that
we should not adopt the belief of its having thus existed " thou
sands of years that preceded the history of man?"
     The sum of what is intended to be conveyed. m the preceding
observations amounts to this ; that, instead of assuming that the
whole of the first five verses of the first chapter of Genesis were
intended to be included in the Mosaic account of the first day's
work, we ought rather to conclude that the first verae records an
antecedent fact, that the earth was created   "  in the beginning." —
The first part of the second verse relates, that the earth was
without form, and void, and in darkness, (without relation to the
time it had so continued,) when, according to the fetter part of
the same verse, the first movement of Omnipotence took place
towards reducing to its present state of order and beauty the
earth, which was the first created portion of the universe ; the
creation of the other parts of which was comprehended in the
six days work.       In a word, that we ought to consider the moving
of the spirit of the Creator upon the surface of the waters, re
lated in the fetter part of the second vetee, as the first movement
of the six days work ; the commencement of which took place
at an uncertain period after the creation of the earth.
                                                                 This-

                         to Cutler's Theory            of the Earth.                               229
   This mode of interpreting the words of the inspired writer
may have heretofore been proposed, of which I have no know
ledge ; but it is now offered in the hope that there is nothing ill
it that can offend the most scrupulous zeal for the cause of reli-
thinking men, without giving offence to any.         If it should be
asked, why   an  innovation  should  now   be broached, and why ail
attempt should now be made to disturb the tranquil belief of ge
nerations ? I reply, that it will be found, as I trust, in no respect
to injure the character of Moses, but rather to confirm          since                       it,
this interpretation will bestagree with our knowledge of the struc
ture of the earth.   And as Truth alone      my object,    shall most

and   not only has had, but still has, advocates.          Philo held that the world was
 formed out of pre-existing matter: that is, he conceived the word foa [he cre
 ated] not to include the creation but the arrangement of matter.            The author of
.the Hook of Wisdom believed that Goo fashioned the world out of unfasUioned

Extract of a Letter from M. J. B. Van Mons                  to Mr. Singer.
    " You     will find interspersed through the first and second vo
lumes of my Translation of Davy, which I have now the honour
to present to you, some fragments of my Svstem of Meteorology.
I consider atmospheric air as a fourth kingdom, having organized
azote for its basis ; as the vegetable kingdom has for its basis
organized carbon ; and as the animal kingdom has both organi
zations.      Organization consists in being hydrogenated by water,
instead of being so by reduced hydrogen ; and the atmospherical
organized body can hydrate itself and suroxygenate itself, in the
same manner as the organized vegetable body hydrates and sur-
hydrogenates itself.        Animal life consists in causing a- cessation
of this suroxygenation and surhydrogenation of the organized
matter of the other two kingdoms, by the formation of water,
which at the same time causes animal heat.                     The changes
of weather which take place from the varying influence of the
planets*, and from the electrifying and unelectrifying influence
of the sun, consist in the oxygenation and hydrogenation, some
times alternate, but more frequently concomitant, of organized
atmospherical matter.          As the oxygen in separating itself from
this matter is not quite in the state of gas, it is obliged to supply
its deficiency of caloric by the vapour of water.               Air perfectly
hydrated, and in which the oxygen is so also, may likewise be
dissolved by water ; it is when the barometer ascends, and when
at the same time the thermometer descends, and when the con
trary march or progress of these two instruments takes place, that
hydrated air dedissolvesf itself.         Azote, hydrogenated by water,
is the oxide of the metal ammonium, of which ammonia is
the oxidule, and organized azote is consequently a sort of gas
 eous alkali, which like the other alkalies can oxygenate itself,
 hydrate itself, hydrato-oxygenate          itself, dissolve, and then take
 up hygrometric water. There is no meteorological phaenomenon,
 however complex, which may not be clearly explained by these
 principles.      Temperature depends on changes in the combina
 tions that take place in air ; and winds are the effects,' not
 the causes, of these changes.          And this explains how all the va
 riations are announced beforehand by the indications of our ap-
    *  Uinjluence  tendant et distendant des astres.         f ,Se dedissout

  paratus.     Electricity forms itself in the air by the combination
  of light with heat, and changes itself into heat when there is a
  tendency to change for rain*.           The moon may by its reflected
  light electrify  the  heat  of  the atmosphere, and thus excite cold;
 but it also lowers the temperature by promoting the dissolution
 of clouds, without contributing to that effect by heat.
      "Will you not make some observations on conducting- rods
  (fjaratoimerres) which subtract from the atmosphere such enor
 mous quantities of electric fluid, which is lost to the globe by
 being conducted into water, and converted jnto heat ? It is only
 since the introduction of these rods, which have been established
 in general use about 35 years, that the seasons have become ir
 regular, and that the weather has scarcely been otherwise than
 unfavourable to a regular vegetation.           They occasion the abor
 tion of the small storms so necessary to afford rain in summer,
 and they derange the great tempests which should mark the trans
 ition of the seasons. Under the Austrian regime, in consequence
 of long droughts and continued rains, the conducting rods were
 ordered to be taken down, and the weather changed immediately.
 Since their introduction, storms have also been much more de
structive than they were before. Perhaps the Harlem Society
will offer a prize on this subject.

                      Annotation by Mr. Singer.
     This synopsis of the meteorological views of M. J. B. Van
Mons was obligingly communicated to me by the author, in con
sequence of the announcement of my intended publication on
the phaenomena of the atmosphere.               Researches of a different
nature have of late so closely occupied my attention, as to ren
der it uncertain at what time I may be able to complete the
proposed work, which will have for its leading object a practical
and popular introduction to the means of observing meteorolo
gical phaenomena : I have therefore thought it better to give
publicity to the opinions of my learned correspondent without
delay, more especially as my present experiments have as yet no
prospect of a speedy termination.
     On the question relating to lightning-rods, and their sup
posed influence in modifying the electric state of the atmo
sphere ; I must observe that I know of no facts that authorize
such an opinion, but I do know of many that militate against it.
We have indeed heard of proposals for procuring or averting
storms at pleasure, by the action of pointed conductors ! And
more recently it has been suggested, that accidents from thiuader

 storms might be prevented over a whole kingdom by an exten
 sive series of conductors : but it will, I presume, appear unques
 tionable, that neither of these proposals can have proceeded from
 a sufficiently attentive consideration of the subject.     tid there is
 reason to think they would never have been advanced by any one
practically conversant with the details of such phaenomena.
    There are two modes in which a conducting rod may be sup
posed to influence the electricity of the atmosphere.             1st, It
may be conceived to diminish the usual positive electricity of
the air.    And 2ndly, it may be regarded as a source of constant
diffusion, a kind of silent discharger, calculated to prevent the
formation of regular thunder clouds, by transmitting the electri
 city of their elementary modifications to the earth.        If the first
mode of operation were admitted as probable, it would teach us
nothing ; for at present we know not either the origin or pur
poses of this regular electricity, nor the absolute relation ir bears
to those changes in the state of atmospherical moisture and dry
ness by which its indications are so obviously and material I v af
fected : still less can we pretend to assert that it     or is, not, es
                                                                     is
sential to vegetation.      Besides,         conducting-rod had the
                                              if   a
power here supposed, how materially would the usual electricity
of the atmosphere be diminished           by

each mountain and promontory, must be then regarded as sub
tracting constantly from the electricity of the atmosphere                :

 100 feet from the ground, has been found to have but               very  a
trifling effect on the atmospherical electricity in its vicinity*.
It  may also be observed, that the modification of cloud called
stratus remains positively electrified, though its lower surface               is
in  contact with the earth.
    These objections apply with still greater force to the second
idea   ;for thunder clouds are usually formed at such an elevation
from the earth's surface as to be entirely out of the influence of
the highest projections thereon       and when they descend wituin

to be unfrequent in situations where these causes are operating,
 comparatively, to the greatest possible extent.
    Many other objections might be stated : but as the question is
proposed merely as a subject for inquiry, it appears unnecessary
 to pursue it further. The statement of M. Van Mons appears to
 advance a circumstance in itsfavour ; but it does not appear to
be given as a fact he has observed himself, and is certainly not
 supported by any correct observations whith which I am ac

    P.S. In the last number of this Magazine it is stated, that
 Professor Dobereiner obtained an amalgam of mercury and hy
 drogen, by decomposing water in contact with negative mercury,
 and that no gaseous hydrogen was liberated.       I have made such
experiments with every attention I could devise, but have not
been able to detect any apparent change in the mercury ; and in
every case hydrogen has been given off at its points of contact
with the water.       The experiment is not perhaps accurately
described.
            GUNNERY     : — EXFJEllIMENTS  AT WOOLWICH.
    We are glad to learn that experiments on this interesting sub
ject, analogous to those which were conducted some years ago
by Dr. Hutton with so much ability and success, are now carry
ing on at Woolwich — Dr. Gregory of the royal military academy,
having been associated with a committee of general and other
officers of artillery, for that purpose.
    In the determination of the initial velocities of projected balls,
the ballistic pendulum is the instrument which has been hitherto
most advantageously employed.          Mr. Robins, its original in
ventor, in the experiments described in his Gunnery, made use
of a ballistic pendulum which weighed very little more than half
a hundred weight.      In the experiments made by Dr. Hutton, the
ballistic pendulums were of various sizes and weights, increasing
gradually from 560 pounds to 2420 pounds in weight, according
to the size of the projected ball, of which the largest was six
pounds.     The pendulum recently constructed in the royal arsenal
at Woolwich considerably ^exceeds in weight and dimensions the
largest that was employed in Dr. Hutton's experiments.              Its
weight, at the commencement of the experiments, was about
7400 pounds, or more than three tons and a quarter.         The face
of the block of timber which forms the core of the pendulum is
3 feet broad and 4 feet high, its horizontal length or thickness
                                                                 being

               Gunnery : — Experiments at Woolwich.               235
being 6 feet. The timber rests upon an iron plate of an inch and
a quarter thick, and the whole is held together by strong vertical
cheeks of gun-metal and the requisite screws and bolts. The
materials of the pendulum are so disposed as to bring the centre
of gravity about 11 feet, and the centre of oscillation about 12
feet, below the axis of rotation ; and to allow the point of im
pact of the ball upon the face of the pendulum to occupy any as
signed place between those two centres. This pendulum, which
was constructed under the direction of Colonel Millar of the royal
artillery, has its frame-work mortised into a permanent edifice ;
 and is so admirably framed and so exquisitely suspended, as to
produce an extraordinary union of freedom and steadiness of
motion with stability of structure.       Such is the firmness of the
construction,    that the  shock   not  merely of 6-pound balls, but
even of 24-pound balls, moving with a velocity of 1300 feet per
second, caused no prejudicial strain in the framing, nor even pro
 duced the slightest perceptible sinuosity in the groove described
by the stylette oiS the broad indicatory arch below the pendulum.
And at the same time, such was the freedom of suspension, that
 the slightest breeze moved this immense mass; and that in every
 case when the experiment was tried, it required more than 60
 oscillations to reduce the semi-arc of vibration from 7Q to 6".
     By the construction of a ballistic pendulum of sufficient magni
 tude to sustain without derangement the shock of large balls mov
 ing with great rapidity, an important point is gained ; since the
 velocities with which balls move when propelled from the heavier
 artillery will no longer remain a matter of mere induction, but a
 fair result of actual experiment.       The velocities of balls fired
 from 12-, 18-, and even 24-pounders can now be readily and sa
 tisfactorily deduced from the motion communicated to the oscil
  lating block by the several balls. In the experiments already
  made by means of this new pendulum, only 6-pounders and 24-
  pounders have been employed ; the intermediate sizes being left
  for subsequent experience.     What has been done, however, fully
  confirms the experiments    of Dr. Hutton as to the law between the
  charges and the velocities, and as to the increased initial velocity
   occasioned by an additional length of bore.        In a variety of
  rounds, both with different charges and with guns of different
  lengths, there was not a single deviation from either of these laws ;
   nor was there a single case in which stronger powder, as indicated
   by an accurate eprouvette, did not furnish the predicted result.
      Other apparatus, we are told, is constructing for the purpose
   of confirming or modifying the old results, and of extending the
   inquiry to many points hitherto untouched.

since touched at Plymouth on her way out.                   She is called the
 Rurik, carries   the  Russian  military flag,    and     is commanded by
 Captain Kotzebue (son to the celebrated author of that name),
 a lieutenant in the Russian navy, and who has already sailed
 round the world in the Nadeshda, Captain Krusenstern.                  There
 are on board two other lieutenants in the Russian navy, Messrs.
 Schichmarew and Sachariin, the former of whom, although longer
 in the service than M. Kotzebue, has cheerfully consented to
 serve under him.        Dr. Eschholz of the university of Dorpat,
 M. Chamisso the naturalist from Berlin, the Danish naturalist
 Wormskild, and the Russian painter Choris, also accompany the
 expedition. The Rurik, it is said, will double Cape Horn in
 the month of November next, and the expedition will employ the
 whole of 1816 and the beginning of 1817 in visiting in the
 South Seas those places which have not been as yet sufficiently
examined.       During the summer of 1S17 they will coast along
the inner shores of America to Behring's Straits, and return by
 the Straits of Torres to the Cape of Good Hope ; so that they
 will probably return to Cronstadt in August 1818.                  It is left,
 however, to M. Kotzebue to prolong his voyage beyond this pe
 riod if he think it necessary for the purposes in view.                   The
 whole plan of the voyage has been drawn up by Captain Kru
 senstern.

                         TO CORRESPONDENTS.
    However just the   remarks sent us by " A Snip- Builder''  may be, thr;f
would have the appearance of personality on the part of the Editor, who
never, but by inadvertency, suffers any thing that can be considered acri
monious to appear in his pages, and certainly not without the author's real
signature.     When gentlemen subscribe their names, the Editor considers
them the best judges of the language it may be proper for them to em
ploy ; but the case is otherwise when the Correspondent is anonymous.
    Mr. Carter's Communication respecting Machinery applicable to Steam-
Boats should have been sooner noticed.       The arrangement which he has
proposed is not new ; but as it is not generally known, vie hoped to have
been able, before this time, to have spared a corner of one of our plates to
illustrate it.

of cirrostratus ; cumuli in the day.       The white and partial strati
which I saw creeping up the valley at sunrise, as 1 rode to Ber-

XLIII.    On the Principles          of Arches.              By A Correspondent,
                                To Mr.Tilloch.
Sir, — At           a time when so many large  bridges are building, a
few objections    to the principles of arches, as exhibited by the
writers on that subject, may perhaps be of some service.
   Dr. Hutton has stated, in his Tracts, vol. i , that there are
three theories ; and that they are all the same in effect, and
yield the same conclusions : but we will suppose there are only
two ; that      is,
                 the wedge theory, and the theory of Emerson, for
the Catenarian theory       the same in fact with Emerson's theory,
                               is
and  is liable to the same objections.
   We think the most likely method of ascertaining the manner
in which the forces act,      to examine an arch that has changed
                                is
its form in consequence of being overloaded either at the crown
or haunches.       If the wedge theorv       correct, the arch-stones
                                                        is
would slide on each other, and the stability of an equilibrated
arch would wholly depend on the friction of the surfaces           con            in
tact and the cohesion of the cement.           But when an arch       so               is
loaded as to press       out of its original form, the arch-stones do
                          it
not slide on each other, neither          there any thing like friction
                                               is
takes place*      for instance; suppose the weight to press on the
                   :
crown, then the joints would open, as shown at             at the same A,
time the    joints at the back of the arch would open as shown at
BB   :  this    what every one who has paid any attention to the
               is
.subject  must    have noticed.
  If   the arch-stones were perfectly smooth, they might perhaps
 act as wedges       but this
                      ;           mere hypothetical case, and has
                                    is   a
 nothing to do with the present inquiry: but suppose the arch-
 stones were connected with        cement which would unite them
                                         a
 as firmly at the joints as the solid part of the stone       evident  ;    it   is
 the arch would be stronger,     but we are at      loss to conceive
                                                                   a
 how the wedge theory could be applied to such an arch         yet,              :          if
 loaded   in   asimilar manner, the fractures would take place at the
    *A   late writer on bridges thinks that an arch may be balanced           the      by
 friction of the joints alone, by giving them different degrees of inclination.

 242                 On the Principles of Arches,
 same points as they would      if the arch-stones had been joined
 with common mortar.                                   ,
    The Emerson theory supposes the arch-stones to be inflexi
 ble lines, which are balanced by vertical weights pressing on the
 angles of contact ; or, what amounts to the same thing, the depth
of the abutting joints of the arch -stones is not supposed to be
of sensiblejnagnitude.      Of this we may say, what Dr. Hutton
has said of the wedge theory, that " it is founded on a supposi
 tion which is neither in nature nor art, and which can never
 take place in any real construction of an arch."     The Emerson
theory certainly furnishes no practical rules for construction,
neither for the depth of the arch-stones nor for connecting
them     together so that they may be less liable  to change their
positions: but this is not the only defect it has, for it does not
determine the form of an arch which would be equally strong
throughout.
    We will take a simple case: let four equal and inflexible bars,
in the same vertical plane, be kept in equilibrio by weights laid
upon the angles, the depth of the abutting joints being very
small, and the points A and B fixed.       Let the weight at D be

                          On the Principles        of Arches.                 243
represented by ac; then, lines being drawn parallel to the di
rections of the bars, ci will represent the weight on the angle
CorE.
  Now, suppose the depth of the joints to be equal dh, and let
the weight at D be the same as before ; then, if the load at D
was sufficient to disturb the equilibrium ; the bars would turn
on the points d,      and f,     I
                            ; therefore, we find the force at E,
that would balance the pressure at D, is measured by ck, and
the stability of the system will be as the difference between ck
and ci equal ki.
    If the load at E, equal ci, was sufficient to disturb the equi
librium, it is evident the bars would turn on the points h, e, and
g; then the stress at E being ci, the weight that would balance
it at D, is c I; and the difference between cl and ca, equal la,
will express the stability: but had the system been uniformly
stable, the differences should have been equal : Therefore, a sy
stem which would be in equilibrio were the joints without sen
sible depth, is not of uniform stability when the depth of the
joints is of some magnitude.
    We conceive that a bridge ought to be so constructed that it
may resist the action of a weight moving along                  it,
                                                          with an equal
 force at any part of its length; and the greatest stress that
 could possibly come upon           ought not to produce
                                     it                          sensible
                                                                      a
 effect on the arrangement of the arch-stones.          Equilibrium,           if
 we understand the term, signifies       balance of parts which would
                                               a
 be deranged     by the slightest pressure partially applied       there  ;
 fore, the form that gives equilibrium to          bridge,
                                                        a      roof, or
                                                                      a        a
 dome, is   the worst that can be adopted.
    There   is  yet another objection we have to make, and that                is
 to the method of finding the thickne«s of the piers.          The piers
 ought to be considered as        apart of the arch, and the stability
 of the whole should be investigated at the same time             for the ;
 strength   of            must  be computed   from the  forces  acting at
               the^>iers
 the places of fracture, which        not always at the springing of
                                          is
 the arch.
  It    would be easy from what has been said, to determine the
 stability of any given bridge, for the place of fracture might be
 nearly ascertained        inspection and find the centre of gravity
                           by                  ;
  of each of the segments into which the joint of fracture divides
  the semi-bridge     ;then the stability both at the crown and the
  haunches might be determined.         For finding the directions of
  the forces, see Mr. Southern's paper, Philosophical Magazine,
vol.xli. p. 321.
   A  bridge formed on the principles of uniform stability would
certainly be the most scientific but considerable deviations from
                                          ;
that form may be made, without any' oftier bad effects than

 those of using a greater quantity of materials, and rendering it
 more difficult to secure the foundations.
    The following method may be used for determining the stabi
lity of an arch experimentally ; and also to illustrate the prin
ciples of arches.    Let a piece of wood be cut to the shape of
 the ring of arch-stones^ if it be a semi-circle, let it be divided
into four equal parts, and make holes through them to meet
each other at the joints, connect them to each other, and to the
 bar AB, with an extensible thread passing through the holes;
 invert the arch, and let weights, proportional to the pressure of
 materials on each part, be suspended from its centre of gravity*,
 then the additional weight required at any part to cause the
joints to open will be proportional to the stability. The whole
might be cut into the shape of arch-stones, and weights hung
 to each piece ; but this causes the experiment to become too
 complicated.
    It is not necessary that the arch should be inverted ; for if it
was prevented from giving way at the ends A and B, it might
be placed over an opening, and the weights suspended by lines
from the centres of gravity as before.        This la™ method might
be employed with advantage to explain the
                                                   principles of arches
to young students.
    We must not omit to observe, that the centre of gravity of
the superincumbent load will not be in the same vertical line
 with that of the segment of the arch ; but the weights ought to
be suspended to a point that would be the common centre of
gravity of both the arch and the load above it.

                            To   Mr. TUhch.
s,R,-M      . La Place with many other philosophers     have been
of opinion that meteoric stones were masses ejected from the
moon ; and the chief objections urged against this theory are,
that their appearance is invariably attended with a swift hori-
zifital motion and violent explosion. But if it can be proved that
under    certain circumstances       these effects must necessarily fol
low, the theory will receive an interesting and material corro
boration. These stones, it is well known, are composed almost
entirely of silicia, magnesia, oxide of iron and nickel, partly me
tallic and partly oxidized. Now modern discoveries have proved
silex   to be an oxide    formed by an unknown                 inflammable      base
which by its extreme avidity for oxygen becomes instantaneously
saturated with it.    Sir H. Davy has demonstrated that magnesia
is also a metallic oxide, and not without great difficulty separable
from its base. Respecting nickel and iron, we know that the
former can only be oxidized, and then but slowly, by exposure to
atmospheric air at an intense heat, and that the latter becomes
more or less oxidized according to its quality and degree of
exposure to air.
    Here then we have a solid body composed of materials all
susceptible of oxygenation, and in that state in which we might
naturally expect to find them       previously existing in their ori
                                      if,
ginal purity, they had been suddenly exposed to the action of
oxygen. In addition to these, let us suppose the admission of
any of the alkaline metals.     What would be the result        mass     if
                                                                          a a
thus composed were to be thrown from the moon with              force
sufficient to come within the range of the earth's attraction? —                 It
would be preqaely that which         experienced in the case of a
                                      is
fall of aeroliUV-     The body would pursue its rapid course, and
by the laws of motion be partly impelled in an horizontal direc
tion.    On approaching our atmosphere the effect upon the com
ponent molecule would be immediate.          The unknown inflam
mable base of silex would absorb its oxygen, and appear in the
state in which   it now exists.      similar effect would be expe
                                      A
rienced by   the  magnesium,   which would become magnesia. The
nickel would from its partial affinity for oxvgen be only partly
oxidized by the heat evolved during the detonation of the alka
line metals, and the iron be so in rather      stronger degree, and
                                                        is a
chiefly  on  its external surface  where       mostit exposed, which
we find to be the case. The alkaline metals would rapidly com
bine with oxygen and as heat would naturally be increased
                      ;                                                           by
the velocity   of motion, violent explosion attended with brilliant

flame would   be the consequence*: and the heated fragment
would be precipitated in all directions. — We have only to conceive
then that oxygen forms no part in the oeconomy of lunar for
mations ; and such would undoubtedly be the effects if a body
thus composed once fell within the limits of our atmosphere.
With respect to the alkaline metals, it may be observed that they
can only be known here in a state of high oxidation ; but we
may easily conceive their existence in planets, as abundantly as
iron, nickel, and other metals, provided there is no oxygen to
form its combinations ; — and however important this subtile sub
stance appears to be in the operations carried on in our globe,
we are not justified in concluding it to be requisite in other syT
stems : — on the contrary, there are arguments for concluding that
in the moon oxygen does not exist.        It has for instance been
generally admitted that she is destitute of an atmosphere,         or
possessed  of  one  infinitely rarer, and   therefore probably    dif
ferently composed from ours; and many accurate observers have
on good grounds doubted the existence of water.          It is almost
unnecessary to remind our readers that air and water depend
upon oxygen for their formation.      It is true that the semblance
of fire has been observed in active and incessant volcanoes ;
but as caloric, heat, and light are all independent properties or
substances, it by no means follows that oxygen should be the only
supporter which Omnipotence is capable of furnishing for the
act of combustion.

    " Metallic salts are generally, not universally, more soluble,"
                                                if
says your correspondent,
                              " according to the greater proportion
of free acid." By this will plainly appear that his experiments
                                 it
must have been extremely confined, or that the inaccuracy of
 them hurried him into error        as      ;  the deliquescent metallic
                                                    it   is
 salts which will not precipitate on the addition of acid         as on the       ;
contrary, permanent salts are precipitated                     by
                                                     it. Therefore G. S.
either made his experiments on deliquescent salts alone, or used
dilute acid, or dilute solutions. He cannot then with propriety
assert the solution depends on free acid, where water              present,       is
 and that in     greater proportion than in acids of the usual spe
                       a

     Your correspondent says, He cannot conceive any period du

             :
forming sulphate of iron, &c. We find in this, that after the ac
tion ceases, the solution        test  byacid, although
                                                    is       quantity of      a

 therefore, as he asserts, the acid in the solution         free, that    is                     is

 cess of acid, instead of being free, was combined  with the metal
to form      salt, then
             a            would be natural to conclude the metal

would remain untouched, on account of its being subject to the
influence of a super-salt, and not to an acid.
    I have always conceived compact and regular formed crystals,
far from containing any extraneous matter, do in that form exist
in the purest state : but this your correspondent contradict?,
when he observes, The excess of acid is free, and merely essen
tial to solution. Let him then break a large crystal of sulphate
of iron, &c. and apply his test for acid ; and if it answers, I hope
he will allow me to class it among the super-salts, and not tell me
that this acid is also free.   Mo«t of the earthy and alkaline salts*
are neutral, and are capable of being separated from acidulated
water by crystallization. This, as may be seen above, is not the
case with metallic salts: but many of their properties agree so
far that I shall at some future period trouble you with an ac
count of them.
    According to G. S. I should have to apologize for troubling
you with a subject already treated of by so able a chemist as
Fourcroy. My aim was, to prove the state in which the acid ex7
ists in metallic salts.     Fourcroy, as I have since found, observes
there is always an excess of acid in metallic solutions, and does
not conclude this to be essential to them.        I therefore conceive
your correspondent      has  equally  failed in his  endeavour to de
tract from the originality of my opinion, and in his attempt to
condemn my conclusions as fallacious and contradictory.

                           To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — The    fact that the human body         is,
                                              bulk for bulk, lighter
than sea-water has been long known, and may be easily proved
by any one who has confidence to throw himself upon his back
in the sea, and there lie at full length with arms extended, but
without the least motion.    I do not, however, remember to have
seen it any where recorded, hotv much the human body         lighter
                                                               is

   Exp. I. Common car against a Scotch dray.
    Exp. II. To determine whether the application of springs is
advantageous to the draught of carriages.
   Two carriages exactly similar, and both of them upon springs,
will be tried against each other, one having the springs pre
vented from acting — the other having the springs at liberty.
   Exp. 111. That carriage, which appeared to have the advan
tage in Experiment the 2d, will be loaded till it nearly keeps pace
with the other carriage. — The difference of weight thus carried
will show the relative advantage of each carriage.
   Exp. IV. The 3d Experiment will be repeated, changing
the situation of the carriages, so that the different draughts of the
carriages may not appear to have been occasioned by the diffe
rent roughness or smoothness of the track on which they ran.
   Exp. V. The relative advantages of short and long perches
will be compared. — Two carriages, similar in all respects, will
he compared ; and afterwards the same carriages, but with the
perch of one of them lengthened, will be compared.
   Exp. VI. The relative advantages of high and low carriages
 will be compared.

     Observations   upon Wheel- Carriage Experiments, conducted         hy
        Richard Lovell Edgeworth, Esq. at Leinster House.
        On the 22d April, 1815.     Agreeably to the Arrangement of
        the annexed Syllabus printed for that occasion.
        Experiment the First; see the preceding Syllabus. — The
    practical experience of all counties of Ireland, for many years,
    has happily proved the superiority of the dray or cart, excepting
    where bye-roads are too narrow for carts, or too uneven for any
    carriage but such as have their wheels so fixed, that the axle
    and wheels must turn together in the manner of the older Irish
    car, a construction very well suited to the state of the roads in
   the age in which it was invented : — this experiment was neg
    lected, I suppose, as unnecessary.
        Experiment II. III. and IV. — These three experiments I shall
   consider as one between two carriages to determine the effects
   of springs.
        That advantage has been derived from the      use of springs    to
   carriages, with respect to lessening their draught, has been prac
    tically proved by many years experience in almost all countries.
   Carriages for burden on two wheels with springs are commonly
   used in the populous parts of England ; in London hundreds of
   such carts are daily to be met with.    It would however be im
   portant to ascertain the precise weight of additional loading
   that can be carried in this manner ; and     if the subject were to
   be considered more immediately      in an agricultural point of
   view, it would be judicious to determine what sort of spring is
   best calculated to answer this purpose, and best able to bear the
   rough treatment of careless and ignorant labourers — but here         I
   am exceeding the bounds of the syllabus before rue.
       Prior to drawing any conclusion, from the occurrences of the
   22d of April, with respect to the use of springs, it is incumbent
  Upon me to endeavour to calculate the effects of the unobserved
  circumstances, that appear to have baffled the exertions of the
  gentleman conducting those experiments, to whose patriotic
  energy for many years the public is much indebted.           It is rea
   sonable to begin with a scrutiny of the nature of the unnecessary
  weight of the unwieldy bodies of the carriages chosen in this
  case, and of their other weights, in my opinion, very erroneously
  called equalizing weights.
«      It appears from the subsequent statement of the weights of
  the several parts of the carriages, that these unwieldy bodies
                                                                     and

          Observations upon Wheel-Carriage     Experiments.      251
 and their cumbrous appurtenances are more than ten times
heavier than they should be, in proportion to their wheels and
axles ; an inconsistence sufficient to destroy the useful effect of
any experiment.        The body of the common cart or dray, used
in the last of these experiments,- is not the one-third of the
weight of its wheels and axle; whereas these deceptive bodies,
as prepared, are above three times heavier than their wheels and
axles — Here is a disparity in proportion of above ten to one.
For the sake of illustration, and to enable me to draw reasonablv
any conclusion from this experiment, I shall consider all weight
beyond that of the common dray as so much loading on both of
these peculiar carriages, unsuitably chosen, where the advantage
by use of springs was to be estimated in proportion to the weight
drawn. It will appear agreeably to my subsequent calculation,
that at the time these carriages were supposed by Mr. Edge-
worth to be empty carriages, and perfectly similar, they were in
reality loaded carriages, of different weights, of different burden,
and differing essentially in construction. It will appear, that
the previous loading, consisting of the unnecessary weight of
body and weights called equalizing weights, of the one was
5 cwt. 1 qr. 23 lbs. to which five hundred weight was added, and
called its loading, together making 10 cwt. J qr. 23 lbs. and the
previous loading of the other was 5 cwt. Oqrs. 13 lbs. to which
was subsequently added, under the denomination of loading,
6 cwt. 1 qr. 01b. making together 11 cwt. I qr. 13 lbs. exhihiting
a. difference of 3qrs. 18 lbs.
    These carriages being supported in front by men, during the
experiment, renders the result very uncertain.
    It was observable that their metal loading was not confined ;
there might therefore be much weight, to be supported by the
men in front of one, and much force of a contrary nature, to be
overcome by the men, in front of the other, as in the instance of
the shafts of one of these carts raising two men many feet from the
ground, during its progress ; weights for such a purpose should
be so fixed as to be unalterable by the motion of the carriages.
    The axles of the carts in question were conical ; their apexes
or extremities were set much below a line horizontal with their
bases respectively.
    Mr. Edgeworth     in his work upon Roads and Wheel Carriages^
page 74, describing the nature of a conical axle bended down
wards, says, "Whoever has observed the hinder wheels of a car
riage, that has the axle much bent downwards, will perceive a
tremulous motion of the whole wheel, which arises from its truly
circular motion being counteracted by the conical motion, to
which it is disposed by the bended axletree." — I am not aware
pf what is meant here by the conical motion of the wheel ; the
                                                              proper

  252      Olservalions upon Wheel-Carriage        Experiments.
  proper ties of the cone do not appear to me to be in any manner
  concerned in the cause of the motion alluded to.
      The centre of the box is supposed to be in the centre of the
  wheel, and to be fitted to the axle, whether it be a cone or a
  cylinder ; the wheel is confined between the shoulder on one
  side, and the nut on the other, on the axle in both cases, against
  either of which the wheel will work with increased friction, ac
  cording to the directions of the forces applied. This tremulous
  motion can at any time be produced upon a paved or hard and
  uneven surface, by the wheels not being parallel, or by being
  obliged to go forward, with the carriage, in directions not in the
  respective plains of their circumferences, whether the axle be a
   cone or a cylinder.
      In either of these cases there are lateral, and not conical mo
  tions imposed upon them, which upon pavement become injurious
   and particularly conspfcuous-r— upon a smooth road less so, but
  increase much the difficulty of draught upon a soft road, in pro
   portion to the depth to which the wheels may happen to sink.
   The position of such axles as used in this experiment, and neces
   sarily the position of the wheels, is ever governed by the eleva
   tion or depression of the shafts in a two-wheeled carriage, — had
   their axles been cylindrical, and placed horizontallv, these diffi
   culties would not have existed.        The wheels of the car, that
   drew the greater load, were several inches higher than the other,
   and the flexibility of its springs was very great, while those of
   the other car were strong enough for the largest mail-coach.
   The experiment would probably have been less rough, had the
  ferriages been previously weighed, an indispensable requisite upon
   such an occasion, and the springs of both cars rendered inflexi
   ble during the operation, that was supposed to equalize them ;
   but their equalization, as attempted, was quite impossible to be
   adequately accomplished, while they differed so materiallv in the
   essential points, viz. flexibility of springs, height of wheels, and
   difference of weight, independent of any irregularities caused Lv
   the use of men in front. — The superiority, that would have ap
   peared in one carriage by pliability of springs and height of
   wheels, was countervailed by the embarrassing weight of its body,
   and weights called equalizing weights, together weighing eighty-
   eight pounds more than the yellow car with its embarrassments.
   The equalization of the cars in the manner, made use of for this
   experiment, is a case somewhat similar to the deceitful balance.
   See Helsham's Lectures.
       I am indebted for a knowledge of the weights of these car
   riages to the kind accommodation given me at the weighing ma-
.  chine of the Farming Society of Ireland, a few days subsequent
   to these experiments, since which time, I understand the car
                                                                  riages

Tiages Have been weighed by Mr. Button at his yard, a difference
appears between the two weighing machines of about one quar
ter of a hundred in seven hundred weight ; as this may have
arisen from difference of weather, or from street dirt being upon
the carriages at the time of weighing, or from Mr. Hutton's
machine being intended for weighing greater weights, I have in
consequence taken the trouble to prove, by stamped weights, the
correctness of the Farming Society machine; and, on again
weighing the yellow car, I find it seven pounds lighter than be
fore, — a few hours dry weather may have produced this change.
I shall however make use of the weights taken in the first in
stance, as those nearest to the weights at the time of the experi
ment.

The weight of the wheels and axle of the yellow car appears to
have been lewt. 2qrs. 221bs. which being deducted from its
total weight leaves the weight of its embarrassing body, with its

weight of a body of a common Scotch dray of the Farming So

therefore 5 cwt. 1 qr. 23 lbs. more burden thaji the body of the
common Scotch dray, which for the purpose of elucidation I
will now suppose with that weight upon      it,  and placed upon the
wheels and axles of this car     ;  to this weight was subsequently
added five hundred weight, called loading, making together
lOcwt.    1qr. 23 lbs. as before mentioned.      The weight of wheels
and axle of the green car   is   1cwt.3  qrs.

shackles of this green car, is 2 cwt. 0 qr. 18 lbs. the embarrassing
body, &c. is therefore 2 cwt. Oqr. 13 lbs. heavier than the body
of Scotch dray, with springs and shackles of this car ; to this
weight was added six and a quarter hundred weight, called
loading, making together 1 1 cwt. 1 qr. 13 lbs. The real nature
therefore of this experiment is fairly stated, when described as
one carriage without springs, having
           Cwt. qr. lb.
            10    1    23   upon it ; another with springs, carrying
            11    1    13   or additional loading, by use of springs,
                  3    18    about the eleventh part of the load, pro
vided  the inaccuracies   with respect to the use of men, the difference
 in size of wheels, and the impossibility of equalization by the
mode resorted to, had not rendered the experiment indefinite.
The weight of loads as here calculated, when considered propor
tionally to the weights of the carriages drawing them, is pretty
similar to the common cart or dray of six or seven hundred,
drawing a load of twenty or thirty.        Had such an experiment as
 this been tried upon a very bad and rutted road, I am inclined
to think that much useful information would have been received
by the public.
    Experiment, No. 5, see annexed syllabus.
    Here, as before, I have to point out unobserved dissimilarities.
 I have not had any opportunity of weighing these carriages —
 they were said to be of equal weights, and exactly similar in
 construction, but for t lie purpose of equalization, as mentioned
 in Report, it was necessary to make the one heavier than the
 other ; this would appear paradoxical ; it has however arisen
from a. mistake — they did not exactly or reasonably correspond
in their construction — the one had the advantage of flexibility
by having fewer and weaker plates in its springs ; this dissimi
larity caused the necessity of increasing the weights upon it ;
they therefore differed in weight, and in springs, and also in va
rious minor though necessary considerations externally visible*
 By the pliability of the slender perch when lengthened, too slight
to be used in ordinary, a further advantage was given to this
 carriage, but without much apparent operation ; it mav, there
fore, not very unreasonably have been suspected, during the ex
periment, that the length of the perch was the countervailing
disadvantage.       I will not however draw this or any precise con
clusion with respect to the facts singly or collectively — they are
all too indefinite ; the previous arrangements, particularly with
respect to the surface used in this case, do not appear to 'me to
have been such as to show the nature of a long perch compara
tively with that of a short one.       I am of opinion that a long

        Observations ttpon Wheel-Carriage             Experiments.      2o5
perch    has several advantages, and a short perch many serious
  disadvantages,    from causes which have not yet come before th*
 public,  either   by experiment or in print ; one cause will how
 ever be considered,       when observing upon experiment No. 6 in
 syllabus.      It will there appear, I presume, that similar disad
 vantages with respect to draught may be produced by shortening
 the perch, or by the elevation of the centre of gravity.
    Experiment No. 6, see annexed syllabus.
    The question of advantage or disadvantage, by the difference
 of height of the centre of gravity of a loaded carriage, involves
 the necessity of considering the effect of the increased velocity
and distance of its motion upon a laterally inclined road, a road
of many ruts, or of short ascents or descents : this motion I would
presume to be seriously diadvantageous, and it is increased pro
portionately with the height of it.           The experiment, as I un
derstood,      was supposed to show that variation with respect to
 height made no difference as to facility of draught or otherwise.
The surface used in this case was a tolerably smooth pavement ;
had it been a very bad road, with various lateral inclinations, I
am inclined to think, for the reasons following, that the eleva
tion of the weight to the height, which is very common practi
cally, would have appeared to be seriously injurious.
    By the first effect of a sudden lateral inclination all the wheels
at the same moment have a force acting upon them in a direc
tion nearly at a right angle with the direction of the forces ap
plied by the horses ; a worse effect may be produced by ruts al
ternately at either side, the velocity of the centre of gravity, and
the distance passed through by             it,
                                            must in these lateral motions-
increase in proportion to its height, and thereby                will swing
                                                                   it
with additional violence from side to side.               Again, when the
front wheels of     a  carriage fall together into    a  hollow or rut, the
weight upon       that axle   becomes    increased   proportionally   to the
diminution of       the   length  of  the   perch,  and  the  height of the
centre of gravity; in this case of the short perch, the angle
formed    by   itwith   a  horizontal line will be nearly double in     a rut
of a   given depth what          would be,
                                 it              the perch were of double
                                                 if
the length.        The same increase of weight acts upon the hinder
axle when in the rut or hollow         ; some proportion of these disad
vantages may be countervailed by the axle, that              out of the rut,
                                                              is

of increased power,         byshortening the distance between the horse

and the axle, is perfectly correct with respect to either a four- of
a two-wheeled carriage ; because a horse can apply more of his
strength, when his traces make an angle, than when they ap
proach more to the horizontal, — but it has not any bearing upon
the question of the length of the perch or means of bringing for
ward the hind wheels, because the direction of the force applied
to them is- at all times governed by the parallel of the road and
position of the carriage.      There are other more important con
siderations, particularly with respect to mail-coaches, that would
be too tedious to enter into upon the present occasion.          Advan
tage   would   be derived, if it  were possible to  have the   weight  so
low as to act with less power upon      the axle  in the rut :  and,  al
though this fact can be shown mathematically or experimentally
by an apparatus for the purpose, yet from the impracticability of
it, with respect to roads, I shall not dwell upon it.
    Experiment, No. 7, see annexed syllabus.
    I am not aware of any difference in the object of this experi
ment from that of number 2, unless it be expressed by the use
of the word wooden ; but as no comparison was made between
wooden and steel springs, which in an agricultural point of vie*
 I very much lament, I shall not enter into that question, but
 merely observe upon the facts in the manner they took place.
 I am sorry that here, as in the former cases, I have to begin by
pointing out dissimilarities in the essential points.
    The equalization of these carriages, that was mentioned to
have previously taken place in private, must, as in the case of
experiment No. 2, have been deceptive for reasons somewhat
similar, as follows ; —
    The quantity of weight acting by the shafts upon the wheels,
that supported tliem in front to supply the place of horses, was
unascertained.      Lifting by hand the points of the shafts, as at,
tentively   done   by Mr. Edgeworth, jun. was deceptive, because
in so doing he was obliged unavoidably to lift the metal ma
chinery and front wheels.        The shafts of Mr. Edgeworth's eart,
being supported by a larger wheel, were seven inches higher
than those of the other cart, which in front was lower than in
rear: this circumstance was a serious disparity, because their
axles were bended — two metal weights were previously fixed by
cords at the fore sloat of this cart, under the denomination, I
suppose, of equalizing weights ; placing these weights so far for
ward had simply the effect of increasing the disadvantages tjife
cart already laboured under, particularly by the- inferiority in
size of its front wheel.
    It is further to be observed, that the carts started from situa
tions pretty level with each other : but at the termination or end
of the track, a point twenty yards from the western wall of the
                                                                   yard,

        Observations   upon JVheel- Carriage Experiments.        257
 yard, and ten from the south side, the cart to the southward was
 very much lower than the other, a fact that is particularly well
 worth attention.    They should therefore have been permitted
to return upon     their respective tracks, as this would have
shown the disparity in point of surface; or had they been brought
back to the east side and again started, having changed places,
the difference with respect to road would likewise have been as-
tertained.    The carts, with the view of counteracting the effect
of any disparity of road, were erroneouslv made to change places
at the west end of the track ; but this was as deceptive as be
fore, because the cart upon the south side, that had the advan
tage of fall of ground in its first progress, was again given the
advantage by being placed to go back upon the north side hori
zontally, while the other, now put to the south side, was obliged
to go back, ascending the rising ground.
    These circumstances with their various dissimilarities, and the
uasuitability of an experiment, where the weight of the loading
was inferior to the weight of the cart, and that a heavy cart sup
ported upon light springs unfit for a weighty load, render it im
possible, in my humble opinion, to collect any accurate or useful
information from this experiment.         Carts of the weight and
strength, in this case used, commonly draw a ton or thirty hun
dred weight.
    I hope I may not be thought presumptuous, when I- say that
the construction of wheel carriages, particularly with regard to
the difference of the effect of weight of body and weight of
wheels, questions distinct that have hitherto been confounded,
and the application of the force of horses to carriages, are all
of them subjects more unconnected than is commonly supposed,
and very much in their infancy with respect to public knowledge.
Many practical errors have of late years been discovered, and
much Useful instruction is no doubt yet to be received.
    I cannot help believing, although with very much deference to
the high authorities upon this subject, that there is an error in
considering wheels in their ordinary application to carriages as
levers.    Mr. Edgeworth, in his work upon Roads and Wheel
Carriages, page 75, considers them as such.       He mentions two
 questions having taken up much time of a committee of the
 House of Commons of England, that sat for ten years upon the
 subjects of roads and wheel-carriages.      The one was, " Do the
                                                      " The other,
 spokes of a wheel on a level road act as levers ?
 "What has been the cause, and what is the use of dishing
 wheels ?"    To this latter question every one can give the answer.
 I cannot, however, with respect to the former question, agree
 with Mr. Edgeworth when he says, "Whoever looks at a wheel
 going over an obstacle, must see that the spoke and part of the
     Vol. 46. No. 210. Oct. 1815.             R                fellow

253       Observations   upon Wheel- Carriage Experiments,
fellow form a bended lever."            This does not appear to me to
be the case.       A third point of force I conceive to be essentially
necessary to form a wheel or any other body into a lever ; this is
sometimes accomplished by a man applying his force to lift the
back part of a wheel, while the horse is perhaps endeavouring
to draw the carriage out of a rut.            It does appear to me, that
a wheel as in ordinary to a carriage, does not resemble a lever
of any class, for the reasons following. All forces acting upon
the axle, either by gravity of the carriage or by any variety of
propelling forces, are resolvable into one force acting upon a
point within the wheel.         All forces acting against the circum
ference by obstructions or unevenness of the surface, upon which
 the wheel moves, are also resolvable into one force acting upon
 one point.     We have now two forces acting against each other
 in an inflexible line. When these forces are in direct opposition
 to each other, the wheel stands still ; when they become so in
 direct as to overcome the friction, the wheel moves forward or
 backward according to the direction of the impelling force of the
 axle.     There are, therefore, in my humble opinion, but two
 forces and two points of force, mathematically speaking, in the
 operation, whether a wheel be formed of spokes or of a solid mass.
 Wheels in other machinery are often unquestionably levers, as
 axis in peritrochio, or where two points of force happen to be at
 different distances from the common centre in the same wheel, or
 in inflexibly attached wheels; or where awheel moveable upon its
 centre be used to transfer a force from one point of its circum
 ference to another, it unquestionably becomes a lever*.
     If the foregoing observations should in any degree tend to in
 duce a further course of experiments upon this subject of the
 highest national importance,           I cannot help entertaining the
 warmest expectation,       that  the    Report of the Committee given
 in the Minutes of the Dublin Society of the thirtieth of
 March last, (inconsequence            of which the experiments were
 instituted,) recommending that " the relative advantages of the
 different carriages be accurately and unequivocally ascertained,"
 may be more reasonably complied with, and that the scientific
  knowledge of that valuable body may be suitably assisted by the
 experience of 'practical agriculturists, so as to insure the exhibi
 tion of satisfactory and decisive evidence of the valuable truths
    * It would
               perhaps be reasonable tor any one interested in this question,
 to obtain in writing the nature or' the analogy, that mny, by any mathema
 tician, be supposed to exist between the lever and the operation of a wheel
 with respect to a carriage.     When on paper, such analogy may fairly
 be scrutinized ; but, if given verbally, it may be plausibly deceptive, or
 counter to the doctrine of the resolution of forces on the definition of the
 levcry

    I have not the honour of being a member of either the Dublin

yet, if the boon be garbed in mystery, the advantage may be

therefore insufficient to give instruction, unless it be offered in
such a manner as to insure its reception in the minds of the
public, who will then no doubt gratefully feel the extent of their

 XLVIII. Some Account of             the Electrical Experiments of
     M. De Nelis, of Malines in     the Netherlands. Communicated
     ly Mr. Singer.
TThe      experiments on the singular effects of the electric charge
on 'metallic cylinders which have been already described, were
continued by M. De Nelis for many years, and have been varied
by him with much ingenuity, and with a degree of patience and
perseverance rarely equalled ; several of the cylinders employed
 in his experiments are now in my possession, and evince the ac
 tion of very considerable power, but the number of explosions
 employed is only stated for two of them ; and I have therefore
 preferred to detail the more systematic series of experiments in
 which I have been so ably assisted by Mr. Crosse ; especially as
  these latter appear to exhibit the phaenomena more obviously
 than any of the results transmitted by M. De Nelis: yet it may
  be proper to notice, that amongst those received from this ac
 tive experimentalist there is a part of the breach of a pistol bar
 rel, and also an inJn cylinder near an inch thick and of small
  bore, each of them very distinctly cracked by repeated explo
  sions.
     It has been already mentioned that M. De Nelis did not find
  in his experiments any relation' between the resistance of the
  different cylinders, and their comparative tenacity' as expressed
                                   R2                                in

  in Mechanical Tables, and that he has consequently ascribed
  these effects to molecular attraction, rather than to the action off
  an expansive force : but the tenacity of a metal as usually con
   sidered, must not be taken as a measure of its power to resist a.
   sudden impulse ; and in my experiments it may be observed,.
   that the results appear to correspond sufficiently with the known
   mechanical properties of the metals.           Possibly very different
   results may have been obtained by M. De Nelis, because all his
   first experiments were made with water, and mine have been
   made almost exclusively with oil, whiph is more certain in its.
   action, not only as a more expansible fluid, but as it presents less
   facility to the dissipation of the charge in a lateral direction.
        The power which has been most frequently employed in these
    experiments is very considerable; but the principal facts may be
    exhibited with more facility bx employing very thin cylinders
    filled with oil, and having ljmf a small bore, for these may be
    distinctly affected by a small battery, or even a few jars.
        M. De Nelis has attempted to trace the course of the electric
    fluid, and has instituted some curious experiments for that pur
    pose.      A square pane of window glass, perfectly clean and dry,
    is slightly powdered over on each side with lycopodium         or with
    powdered resin (the former adheres best) .          In this state it is
    placed vertically between the points of Henly's discharger, which
    are made to touch the opposite surfaces of the pane at its centre ;
    the charge of a small jar is then passed from one wire to the
    other, and two radiated figures of different appearance are pro
     duced.     Fig. 1, Plate IV, represents that on the positive side,
    and fig. 2 that on the negative side.
         I find that the results of this experiment are not very regular,
     and are much influenced by the height of the charge, and the
     continuance of the contact of the charged jar with the dis
     charger.     Each figure is exhibited most distinctly when the op
     posite surface of the glass is clean.     I have therefore sometimes
     employed two panes of glass placed together, and with their
     outer surfaces only powdered : the effect is usually best obtained by
-
     keeping the jar in contact with the wires for a few seconds, and
     even iu that case the jar will be but partially discharged : the
     effects are therefore analogous to those obtained in the Experi
     ments of LLehtenberg and Bennett, and do not appear to me to
     offer any satisfactory evidence of the course of the fluid in the
     discharge.
         The same observation applies in some degree to another in
     genious experiment of M. De Nelis, with is interesting from other
     considerations. The figure on the opposite page represents the ap -
     paratus. 1 and 2 are glass tubes, nearly filled with water, and each
     containing two thick silver wires A and B, which are, disposed in
                                                                        the

              Some Account       of Electrical Experiments.         261
 the axis of the tube, and with a small interval between them at
 its centre, so as to form an interrupted metallic circuit in water.
 The tube I, is placed between the conductor of an electrical
 machine and the knob of an insulated jar C, and the tube 2,
 between the outside of the same jar and the ground.            The jar
 is provided with a Laite's electrometer, which occasions a dis
charge regularly at a certain number of turns of the machine.
Now, according to the Franklinian theory, the jar can only be
charged under these circumstances by electricity passing through
the tube 1 from A to B, to the knob of the jar ; and through
the tube 2, also from A to B in its course from the outside of
the jar to the earth. M. De Nelis found that by repeated charges
of the small jar for four or five hours, the wire A in each tube
became oxidated, and the oxide produced was also in each tube
attracted by the wire B.         By reversing the tubes at the end of
the experiment, and proceeding with the charges, these effects
were precisely reversed, as is the case when the same manipula
tion is employed with the Voltaic apparatus.          From this he con
cludes, that the phaenomena          of  electricity are produced by a
single current, but at the same time objects to Franklin's theory
in explanation of them.         The indications of this experiment are
very  analogous    to  many  of  those usually employed in illustration
of the Ley  den   jar;  but  it  exhibits more decisively the identity
of the signs evinced by     the  outside of an insulated jar during the
process of charging, with those of the conductor by which the
jar is charged; and it shows at the same time that the electrical
  machine,as well as the Voltaic apparatus, produces very oppo-
                                     R 3                            site

site chemical effects when its influence is transmitted from a
metal to water, to those which are invariably attendant on its
transmission from water to metals.
    In pursuing these experiments, M. De Nelis fastened two gold
wires on a plate of glass by means of sealing-wax ; the wires
were disposed in a line, with their proximate ends in close con
tact with the surface of the glass, and at the distance of half a
line from each other. 'A drop of oil being placed over the inter
val, and a current of sparks passed from one wire to the other,
it was found that after fifty turns of the machine, a small hole
similar to the impression of the angle of a diamond, was made
in the glass beneath the negative wire, but no effect of a similar
kind was to be observed about the positive wire.
  ' I have repeated this experiment with a slight variation ; the
gold wires were attached to a plate of glass, cut in the form of
 the lqtter V.    The wires were fastened to the glass near its edges
with a separation between them of an eighth of an inch, which
was placed very near the lower apex of the plate ; the glass
plate being immersed in a wine glass filled with olive oil, the
effect is a little assisted by the pressure of that fluid ; the sparks
were received from the conductor by a large insulated ball,
placed at an inch distance from           and connected with one of
                                            it,

ground.      With   one  of my cylinder  machines   571  inches in cir-r

 cavation was made beneath the negative wire.
    An experiment very similar to this was made some years ago
by   my friend Mr. Crosse, who has repeatedly shown              to me    it
and others  ;    he employed water instead of oil       and having in

view only the decomposition of the water, and the perforation
of the glass, made the separation of the wires so small, that the
constant occurrence of the perforation under the negative wire
escaped his observation.
  It   will be obvious to electricians, that the effect produced in
this experiment        very analogous to the perforated card in that

              Some Account    of Electrical Experiments.          263
    P. S. — Since the preceding account was drawn up, a letter
has been received from M. De Nelis, in which some other parti
culars concerning his experiments are detailed.      Speaking of the
radiated figures produced on a plate of glass covered with pow
dered lycopodium;      he says, that if a large pane is employed
coated on one side, and covered with lycopodium on the other,
the full charge of a jar of a square foot coated surface, conveyed
to the powdered side of the plate by a pointed wire, will pro
duce a beautiful radiated figure of considerable size, in which it
may be distinctly observed, that when a positive charge is em
ploved, the action by which the figure is produced proceeds from
the centre (that is the positive wire) to the circumference ; and
that when a negative charge is employed the appearance is di
rectly contrary, evidently proceeding from each pore of the vi
treous surface towards the negative point at its centre.        This,
M. De Nelis observes, " appears to him to furnish much light in
explanation of the charge of idio-electric substances by the
theory of molecular attraction." — It may indeed be observed,
that the plumose and star-like figures produced by positive elec
tricity, when contrasted with the smooth lines, dots, and balls,
which result from negative electricity, evince an action which
.corresponds very accurately with the opinion that the opposite
electricities are respectively but the condensed and rarified
states of a single fluid : but the same evidence is given in a very
similar manner by the different appearance of positive and ne
gative light; and all the varieties of Lichtenberg's figures have
been familiar to English electricians since the extensive experi
ments of Mr. Bennett on that subject.
    Another experiment which M. De Nelis has lately made is
thus described:
                   " Take a small pane of flint glass, and two thin
strips of silver, each about two or three lines wide, and so thin
that it may easily bend.       These strips are to be fixed on the
centre of the plate of glass by means of wax, their ends being at
the distance of a line from each other ; around this interval fix
a circle of wax one inch diameter, and a third of an inch high,
and fill it with olive oil, over which place a plate of glass to pre
vent the oil from being thrown about by bubbles of gas which
are always disengaged from it by the action of electricity.     Place
this apparatus so that a current of sparks from a powerful ma
chine may traverse the interval between the silver slips ; imme
 diately inflamed bubbles of gas will appear ; and the attraction
 of the fluid for the bases of the glass is so great, that these little
 balls of fire pass alternately over the whole surface of the silver
 slips. If the action of a powerful current of electricity is con
 tinued in this way for an hour, the glass between the slips will
                                 R 4                                 be

264              .               An Analysis of
be entirely destroyed*; and what has surprised M. De Nelis
most, the silver bands will be bent back from the glass in pro
portion as it is destroyed."
 XLIX. An          Analysis of the Mineral Waters of Dunblane and
         Pitcaithly.       By John Murhay, M.D. F.R.S. Ed.
                    T.   Analysis of the Dunblane Water.
 This      water was discovered last summer, and was first taken
 notice of, from the circumstance of the frequent resort of flocks
 of pigeons to the ground where it breaks out.                    It appears in
 two'springs,      at  the distance  of nearly  half  a mile  from  each other,
 in a field about two miles to the north of Dunblane, the pro,-
 perty of the Earl of Kinnoul.             This district is at no great di
 stance from the range of the Grampians,                 to which it ascends ;
 masses of the primitive rocks are spread over the surface, and
 are found in the beds of the streams ; among which the conglo
 merate rock that seems to skirt the Grampians is abundant.
 1 he prevailing rock of the district itself is the red sandstone,
 and it is generally coveied by a bed of gravel, in many places of
 considerable depth.            It is from this sandstone that the water
  appears    to  issue.    The   spring, however, in both the places where
  it breaks out, has been laid open only to the depth of two or
 three feet from the surface, and has not been traced to' any ex
  tent.     Its proper source is therefore unknown, and it also re
  mains uncertain, how far it may be diluted with water from the
  surface, or from other springs.           The water from the lower, or.
  what for distinction may be named the South Spring, is weaker
                                                                        '
  in taste than the water of the North Spring, and, from the sub
  sequent experiments, is proved to contain rather less foreign
  matter. The ingredients, however, are the same, land the dif
  ference therefore probably arises from the water of the lower
  spring being further diluted in its course.              This difference led
  to the analysis of the water of both springs.             It is proper to re
  mark, that both have been submitted to examination after a
                                                                            ' ' '
  season unusually dry.
                Analysis    of the Water of the North Spring.
      The taste of this water is saline, with some degree of bitter-
      * Much    less time will bo required to produce tliis effect, when the in
   terrupted circuit is assisted by receiving the spark from the conductor on
   a large inslauted ball, as  I have described for the other experiments.

   ness.       As procured from the principal pool at which it issues,
   it is free from smell ; procured, however, from some other pools,
   at the distance only of a few feet, its smell is slightly sulphureous,
   probably owing to impregnation from matter at or immediately
   under the soil.          Its sensible operation on the system is that of
   a diuretic and purgative.           The former effect is usually obtained,
   when a quantity is taken by an adult, from an English pint to a
   quart ; the latter, when more than a quart is taken.             The spe
   cific gravity of the water is 1 '00475.           It suffers no change in
   its sensible qualities from exposure to the air.
        The state of the spring is at present such, that any gaseous
    impregnation of the water cannot be determined with precision.
    Bubbles of air frequently rise from the bottom of the pool, but
    this is merely atmospheric air: transmitted through lime-water,
    it produced no sensible milkiuess ; nor does the water appear to
    contain any free carbonic acid.
        The usual reagents present with the water the following ap
    pearances :
     1.  The colours of litmus, violet, and turmeric, are not sensibly
             affected.
     2. Muriate of barytes produces an immediate turbidness, and
             rather copious precipitation, which is very slightly, if at all,
             removed by nitric acid.
     3. Nitrate of silver gives a very dense and abundant precipitate.
     4. Water of potash produces a turbid appearance, not very con
                           '
             siderable.                  ,
     5. Carbonate       of    potash  throws  down an abundant precipitate,
             which disappears with effervescence on adding nitric acid.
^-   6. Lime-water causes no change.
     7. Ammonia does not cause any precipitation, nor does it even
           '
              impair the transparency of the water.
     S. Oxalate of potash, or of ammonia, occasions a copious pre
              cipitation.'
     9. Tincture of galls has no immediate sensible effect ; but after
              ah hour or two a purplish tint is exhibited, which deepens
              from exposure to the air, and inclines to olive-green.
         These results establish the following conclusions :
     Esper. 1. proves that no free acid or alkaline matter is present,
         nor any alkaline carbonate.
     Exper. 2. denotes the presence of sulphuric acid.
     Exper. 3. indicates the presence of muriatic acid.
     From Exper. 4. and 5. may be inferred the presence either of
         lime, or magnesia, or both.
     Exper. 6. and 7. prove that magnesia is not present, nor argil.
     Exper. 8. proves the presence of lime.
     Exper. 9. indicates a minute portion of iron.

  266                        An Analysis of
     The saline taste of the water, and the precipitation so abun
  dant by nitrate of silver, render probable the presence of mu
  riate of soda, and it is accordingly obtained when the water is
  evaporated nearly to dryness, cubical crystals of it forming in the
 saline liquid.
      From the whole, therefore, the principal ingredients of this
 water may be inferred to be muriates of soda and lime, with a
  smaller portion of a sulphate, and a minute quantity of iron.
  These conclusions suggested the following method of analysis.
     An English pint of the water was evaporated to dryness ; and
 the solid residuum was exposed to a heat approaching to red
 ness, until it became perfectly dry.          It weighed while warm
  47 grains.     It quickly attracted   moisture  from the air, so that
 its^surface   soon  became    humid  ;  and  on leaving it exposed for
  twenty-four hours,    a considerable portion was dissolved, forming
  a dense liquor, while a portion remained undissolved.
     The whole solid matter being rendered dry, was submitted to
 the action of alcohol, with the view of separating by solution
 the muriates of soda and lime, of which it was supposed to be
 principally composed.        It is well known that this method is
 liable, in some degree, to two sources of error ; the one, that a
 little muriate of soda is dissolved by the alcohol with the muriate
 of lime ; the other, that even when a large quantity of alcohol
 is employed, the undissolved muriate of soda retains a small por
 tion of muriate of lime.       In estimating the quantities from the
 results, these errors, indeed, in some measure, counterbalance
 each other ; but still they may exist in different degrees, ac
 cording to the quantity and strength of the alcohol, and it is
 necessary therefore to obtaiu perfect precision, to obviate theiu
 as far as possible.
     With this view, the entire matter was digested with repeated
portions of alcohol, of the specific gravity of 8.36, until about
six times its weight had been employed ; the solvent action be
ing aided by frequent agitation, and an occasional heat of about
100°.      It was then lixiviated with a small portion of distilled
water, to remove more effectually from the muriate of soda any
adhering muriate of lime. The different liquors being mixed,
were evaporated to dryness.; and this dry mass was again sub
mitted to the action of alcohol, more highly rectified, (being of
the specific gravity of 825,) and in smaller quantity, so as to
dissolve only that part of it which was muriate of lime.       A small
portion of muriate of soda, which had been dissolved in the first
digestion, was thus obtained, and was added to the residue of
that operation.       The whole undissolved matter being dried at a
low    red heat, weighed while warm 2S 5 grains : it was in small
grains, having a taste purely saline.        The alcoholic solution af
                                                                forded.

           the  Mineral Waters of Dunblane and Vitcaithhj.         2G7
   forded, by evaporation,     a matter which entered into fusion, and
   which,    after being dried at a heat approaching       to redness,
   weighed    while  warm   18*2 grains.   It was highly deliquescent,
  so as to increase quickly in weight, and in a short time became
   humid on the surface.
      These two products were evidently principally muriate of so
  da, and muriate of lime.        But it was necessary to ascertain if
  they   were   entirely so, as both of them might contain small por
  tions of other ingredients.
     The matter dissolved by the alcohol, supposing it to be mu
  riate of lime, would require for its conversion into sulphate of
  lime about sixteen grains of sulphuric acid, of the usual strength.
  Eighteen grains were added with a small portion of distilled wa
  ter, and heat was applied ; vapours of muriatic acid were dis
  charged : To render the mutual action more complete, small
  portions of water were successively added, the soft mass being
  frequently stirred, and when the vapours had ceased to exhale,
  the heat was raised to redness, to expel any excess of acid.     The
  dry matter weighed 22 grains, precisely the quantity that ought
  to be obtained from 18 grains of, muriate of lime.
      It was diffused in a quantity of water, which it at first ab
  sorbed     with a hissing noise.      The water, after having been
  added in successive quantities, with frequent agitation, being
  poured off, the undissolved matter was dried at a low red heat:
  it weighed 1 8-5 grains, and formed a soft white powder free
  from taste.      The water poured off was very slightly acidulous.
  This was neutralised by ammonia; it was then evaporated to
  dryness, and the solid matter was heated to redness.        On again
  submitting it to the action of a small quantity of water, a por
  tion remained undissolved, which weighed when dried two
   grains.
      There were thus obtained 20-5 grains of sulphate of lime, a
   quantity equivalent to 16-7 of dry muriate of lime.       The small
   portion of liquor which remained in the last operation had a
   bitterish taste: by spontaneous evaporation it formed acicular
   crystals ; diluted with distilled water, it became slightly turbid
   on adding oxalate of ammonia, and more so on the addition of
   alcohol ; but in the latter case the transparency was restored
  on adding water.        With a minute portion, therefore, of sulphate
  of lime, it appeared to be principally sulphata of soda, derived
  from a little muriate of soda, which, notwithstanding the pre
  cautions that were employed, had adhered to the muriate of
   lime.
      The matter which remained undissolved by the alcohol, weigh-
.  ed, it has been stated, 28'5 grains.      It remained to ascertain if
   it were entirely muriate of soda.
                                                                  Being

 268                         An Analysis of
      Be;'ng agitated with about half an ounce of distilled water, the
  greater part was dissolved,          The portion which remained un
  dissolved, after being washed with small quantities of distilled
  water, and dried, weighed 2 '4 grains.           To this matter a little
  diluted nitric acid being added, a slight effervescence was ex
  cited : a thin crust, too, adhered to the sides of the small glass
  globe in which the last stage of the evaporation had been per
  formed, which was dissolved with effervescence by a weak acid.
  The quantity of carbonate of lime thus indicated, may be esti
  mated at 9*5 grain.        The remainder of the undissolved residue
  being    washed  and   dried,  was heated with two or three drops of
  sulphuric acid,     and was   thus  rendered soluble in water.    When
  neutralized by ammonia, die solution became milky; but its
  transparency was restored by adding more water; it became
  quite turbid on adding oxalate of potash, and a precipitate was
 thrown down by alcohol.             It was therefore sulphate of lime.
  Its quantity may be stated at two grains.
     The solution had a taste purely saline. The test of oxalate
 of ammonia, however, showed the presence in it of a small quan
 tity of Jime ; the addition of the oxalate was therefore continued
 as long as any precipitation took place, and the precipitate was
 collected and dried.        It weighed I '3 grain. This production
 of oxalate of lime evidently arose from the presence of a small
 portion of muriate of lime, which, notwithstanding the precau
 tions that had been employed, had adhered to the muriate of
 soda.      Supposing that this had not escaped the action of the
 alcohol, but had been dissolved by        it,    and in the subsequent
 stage of the experiment, been converted into sulphate of lime,
it  would have increased the quantity of this sulphate about 1'2
grain, making     it    therefore 21*7, equivalent to 17'6 grains       of
dry    muriate of   lime  which the pint of water contains.
     The solution contained also     a     minute quantity of sulphuric
acid ;    for after removing any slight excess of oxalic acid that
might have been present,      it    still gave
                                            a    precipitate on the addi
tion of muriate of barytes.          Supposing this, as well as the rest
of the sulphuric acid, to have existed in the water in the state
of sulphate of lime, will increase the quantity of that ingredient
                       it
(calculating from the weight of the precipitate of sulphate
of barytes obtained) from the two grains formerly noticed to
2-9.
    There appeared now to remain nothing but pure muriate of
soda.      The solution by slow evaporation afforded that salt         in
cubical crystals, which, dried at a low red heat, Weighed 24*5
grains.      Allowing 0'8 of this as the portion of product formed
by the action of the muriate of barytes,         it.  leaves 23'7 grains.
And  if   to this be added one grain, as the equivalent of the small
                                                                 portion

portion of sulphate of soda, already noticed as formed by the
action of the sulphuric acid on the muriate of soda adhering to
the muriate of lime after the operation             of the alcohol, it gives
the quantity of muriate of soda at 24-7 grains.

    Having completed the analysis in this manner, I wished to
confirm it by a different method.           A very simple one presented
itself, — to reduce by evaporation to dryness, — obtain the sul
phate of lime as before,-— then, dissolving the mixed mass of
muriate of lime and muriate of soda in water, decompose the
muriate of lime by oxalate of ammonia, so as to find the quan
tity of it present, and after evaporation to volatilize the muriate
of ammonia by heat, and thus obtain the muriate of soda. The
results in this mode ought to correspond with those in the for
mer; and the one, therefore, afford a confirmation of the other,
or lead to the discovery of any fallacy if it exist.
    A pint of the water was evaporated to dryness, and afforded,
 as before, 47 grains of solid matter.            This being submitted to
the action of a.-small quantity of distilled water, was dissolved,
with the exception of a residue of sulphate of lime, which weighed
2'6 grains, and a little carbonate of lime, which may be esti
mated, as before, at 05 grain.
    To the clear solution, a solution of oxalate of ammonia was
added as long as any turbid appearance was produced ; and after.
 the precipitate had subsided, the liquor was heated nearly to
boiling, to render the mutual action and the precipitation more
perfect.       The precipitate being repeatedly washed with distilled
water, was dried by the heat of a sand-bath raised gradually,
 and kept lower than a red heat.               It weighed 21 grains. The
 quantity of muriate of lime which would be equivalent to this,
 cannot be inferred with certainty, from any previous analysis of
 oxalate of lime ; for as the oxalate cannot be exposed to a red
 heat without decomposition, it cannot easily be subjected to a
 precise degree of heat, by which we can be certain of obtaining
 it in a uniform state of dryness*. It is necessary, therefore,

270                           An Analysis of
that in every ease the quantity of lime should be found in the
oxalate that is operated on.      The above quantity of 21 grains
was converted by calcination into carbonate of lime, and this
being decomposed by muriatic acid, the quantity of muriate of
lime obtained, dried at a low red heat, and weighed while warm,
amounted to 18-3 grains.
    The liquor poured off from the precipitate was evaporated to
drvness ; and to expel the muriate of ammonia formed by the
action of the oxalate of ammonia on the muriate of lime, the
heat was continued while any vapours were disengaged, and at
the end was raised nearly to redness.       The dry mass weighed,
                           '
xvhile warm, 25 grains.       Being dissolved in water, its solution
was rendered verv alightly turbid by the addition of muriate of
barytes, showing the presence of a minute portion of sulphuric
acid.   A quantity of precipitate was collected, which, when
 dried, weighed f>8 grain.     Supposing the sulphuric acid of this
to have originally existed in the water, along with the other por
tion of this acid, in the state of sulphate of lime, it gives a pro
 portion of that sulphate of 0*5 grain, and of course increases
the quantity of it from the 2-6 grains obtained by evaporation to
2' 1 grains.   An equivalent quantity must at the same time be
subtracted from the proportion of muriate of lime, which may
therefore be reduced to 18 grain's.    By evaporation of the liquor,
muriate of soda was obtained, weighing, when it had been dried
at a low red heat, 24-3 grains.       Of this a small portion (0*4)
would be formed by the muriate of barytes, which requires to be
deducted ; but then the sulphuric acid which existed in the
mass, could, after the action of the oxalate of ammonia, and the
exposure to a red heat, exist in it onlv in the state of sulphate
of soda, in the production of which an equivalent portion of
muriate of soda would be decomposed.        The quantity of muriate
of soda obtained, therefore, by the evaporation, may be regarded
as the just proportion indicated by the analysis.
    The results, then, by this method, agree very nearly with those
by the other; being of solid ingredients in a pint of the water,
               Muriate of soda                    24*3 grains.

 muriate of barytcs ; applying this reagent with a slight excess of
 acid, so as to prevent any precipitation of carbonate.              The
 quantity  of precipitate    thrown   down   from  a  pint of the water,
 amounted, after drying at a low red heat, to 6-l grains, equiva
lent to 3-5 grains of sulphate of lime.         As the portion of sul
phate of lime thus obtained, above that obtained by the evapo
ration, would remain principally mixed with the muriate of soda,
the quantity of that ingredient falls to be reduced a little, and
may therefore be slated at 24 grains.
    It remained to ascertain the proportion of iron. The quan
tity, however, was evidently so small as to present a difficulty.
 Succinate of ammonia, and benzoate of soda, produced little or
no effect on the water in its natural state.            Infusion of gall*
produced, after some hours, a dark colour, and a precipitate very
slowly subsided.       This method has been employed to ascertain
 minute quantities of iron, and I endeavoured to avail myself of
it, — adding to the water infusion of galls, in small successive
portions, at the interval of a day or two, as long as the colour
 appeared to be rendered deeper leaving
                                     ;          it   exposed to the air
for   alonger time, that the whole matter rendered insoluble might
subside     and lastly, washing the precipitate, drying and calcin
            ;
ing   it,to consume the vegetable matter, and obtain the oxide of
iron. The difficulty, however, attending this method,              isthat
of precipitating entirely the iron, the liquor never becoming co
lourless.    In one experiment, conducted with much care, the
quantity of the calcined product from two pints amounted to
0-4 grain     but
                ;   itconsisted partly of carbonate of lime.       To re
move this, pure muriatic acid diluted was added in excess, and
a   moderate heat was applied    ;     the precipitate was entirely dis
solved, and the liquor acquired          a  deep yellow colour.     Being
further diluted,     alittle pure ammonia was added to       it,in close
                                                                    a
phial, to precipitate the oxide. of iron, while the lime should
remain dissolved.          The quantity thus obtained, when dried,
amounted to 027 grain.
     This method being liable to the above objection,      I    employed
 another    :two pints of the water were evaporated          :   when re
 duced to about two ounces,         a  brownish coloured sediment was
 deposited, which was removed      ;     the evaporation was carried to
 dryness, and the dry mass was redissolved in distilled water.
 The insoluble residue was of a grayish colour, and to this the
 tleposite formed during the evaporation            was added.      It was
 known       previous experiments, that the greater part of the iron
            hy
 was separated in this way; the insoluble matter, when digested
 with muriatic acid, affording    a    liquor, when diluted with water,
 which gave, after neutralization with ammonia,          a    deep colour
 with tincture of galls. To ensure, however, the             more  perfect
                                                                 separation

272                           An Analysis of
separation of the iron, ammonia was added to the solution of
the solid matter which had been procured by evaporation ; and
care being taken that the ammonia was free from carbonic acid,
little or no precipitation could take place but of oxide of iron.
A yellowish flocculent precipitate subsided slowly, which, after
being washed, was added to the insoluble residue.
    The insoluble matter thus collected consisted, as the preced
ing steps of the analysis establish, chiefly of sulphate, with a
smaller portion of carbonate of lime, with which was mixed the
oxide of iron.    A drop or two of sulphuric acid was added, to
convert the carbonate into sulphate of lime ; and heat was ap
plied to expel any excess of acid. A little pure muriatic acid
was then added to dissolve the oxide of iron, and to form with,
 more certainty the red muriate, soluble in alcohol, a drop of
nitric acid was added along with it. On applying heat, with
the addition of a little water, to favour the action, a yellow co
lour was acquired.     When the excess of acid was nearly dissi
pated,   the mass was  repeatedly lixiviated with alcohol, in which
sulphate of lime being insoluble, the muriate of iron only would
be dissolved.    The alcohol acquired accordingly a yellow colour.
 Being evapotated by a gentle heat, it gave a residuum, which,
 on a drop of nitrous acid being added, became of a deep red
dish-brown colour, and after being heated strongly, weighed
 0 34 grain.   Redissolved in muriatic acid, it formed a rich             yel
 low coloured solution, and gave       deep colour with tincture

When taken up after continued dry weather, it afforded, by eva
poration, 42 grains of solid matter from a pint; the other af
fording, at the same time, 47 grains.           Its specifie gravity was
found to be 1-00419.          It  was  in this   state, the strongest in
which it was found, that it was submitted to the following ex
amination.
    The application of reagents produced the same appearances'
as with the water of the North Spring, indicating, therefore, the
presence of the same ingredients.         To determine this with mor#
precision, and to ascertain the proportions,          the same methods
of analysis were employed which had been used with regard to
the other.      It will be sufficient to state the results by one me
thod, — the second of those before described.
    A pint of the 'water was submitted to evaporation, and af
forded of dry matter, weighed while warm, 42 grains.                This
was redissolved in distilled water.        There remained undissolved
a portion, which, when thoroughly dried, weighed 2-5 grains.
This suffered a very slight effervescence with muriatic acid, si
milar to that excited in the insoluble matter of the water of the
North Spring ; a similar thin crust, too, had formed on the sides
of the glass capsule, which was removed with effervescence by
a drop of muriatic acid.         The relative proportions, therefore,
of sulphate and carbonate of lime may be regarded as the same :
and the insoluble residue will thus consist of 0*3 of carbonate,
and 2-3 of sulphate, of lime.          By precipitation by muriate of
barytes, from another pint of the water similar results were ob
tained.
    To the clear liquor, oxalate of ammonia was added as long
as it produced any turbid appearance.          The precipitate collected
and    dried, being converted by calcination into carbonate of lime,
afforded, when acted on by muriatic acid, 16 grains of dry mu
riate of lime.
    The solution poured off from the precipitate was evaporated
to dryness, and the dry mass was exposed to a heat gradually
raised to redness, until it ceased to exhale any vapour.             The
muriate of ammonia formed by the action of the oxalate of am
monia on the muriate of lime, was thus expelled, and the rriu-           .
riate of soda of the water remained.          It weighed 22*5 grains.
    The results, then, by this method, are from a pint of the water,

  274                          An Analysis of
    The proportion of iron I have stated as similar to that of the
  North Spring, from the colour produced by the tincture of galli
 being nearly the same.
    From the almost perfect similarity in the composition of the two
 waters, with regard to the proportions of their ingredients, there
 is every reason to conclude that they are from the same spring;
 the weaker being either mixed with surface-water at the pool,
   or being diluted in its course.
       The determination of the composition of this water suggests
   the question, whether this is such as to account for the medicinal
   effects it produces.      It acts, as has been stated, as a diuretic,
   and in a larger dose, as a cathartic.            This water, and the mi
   neral water of Pitcaithly, present, in some respects, a peculiarity.
   The greater number of saline waters which have a purgative
   quality, contain magnesian salts, to which, as they are known
   to act as cathartics, the effect is obviously to be ascribed.               Of
   the ingredients of the Dunblane and Pitcaithly springs, muriate
   of lime is scarcely known to have any purgative power in its
   pure form, and if muriate of soda possess
                                                       it,
                                                       it      is  only in an     in
  considerable degree.        Still, there   can   be   no   doubt, that it    to
                                                                              is
  this impregnation that their operation        is     owing, and they afford
a    proof, therefore, of what    is  indeed sufficiently established, that
  the powers of mineral waters are often much greater than could
  be expected from the nature and quantity of their ingredients,
  and that the action of saline substances           is   increased, and con
  siderably modified, when they are in a state of great dilution.
      Independent of its purgative operation, and its adaptation to
  the treatment of diseases in which this       is     advantageous, its eom^
 position may probably       render it  a  remedy     of efficacy in some con-N
  stitutional affections, particularly in scrofula.            Muriate of lime
  has attained some celebrity in the treatment of this disease                ;   it
is   a substance of considerable activity in its effects on the living
 system  ;   and  itwill probably operate with more effect, and more
  advantage, in the state of dilution in which            it   is presented in     a
 mineral spring, than when given in         a      more concentrated form.
 The muriate      of soda may coincide with       it      in efficacy, and will
lae.  of advantage   from   its  grateful   taste,  and    its stimulant action
 on the    stomach.     And     the  chalybeate impregnation will com
 municate some degree of tonic power.                When employed in such.
 cases,  it probably ought to be given in smaller doses than when
 the advantage to be derived from          it     depends on its purgative
 operation    ; and    it
                        may   even   prove   more     advantageous,     if given
 in state
     a       of greater  dilution.  I     shall  in  the   sequel have to -state
a view of its composition, which connects            it     with some mineral
springs of great celebrity, and particularly with the Bath waters.

   The water of Pitcaithly may be regarded as the principal mi
neral  water of the saline class in this country.     Dr. Donald
.Monro showed, that, along with a little mild calcareous earth,
it contained muriate of soda, with a deliquescent salt, which he
inferred to be chiefly " a calcareous marine," that       muriate    is,
of lime*. An analysis of         was published a number of years
                                      it
ago, executed      Messrs. Stoddart and Mitchell of Perth. There
                     by
are different springs, the waters of which they found to be some
what different in strength.    The nature of the impregnation

given, however, so far as       have been able to discover, of the
                                  I

to which their proportions are referred.          Hence no comparative
estimate can be made      of    with
                                  it   any   other  mineral water      and   ;
this led me to undertake its analysis,      in the same   manner   as that
of the Dunblane water.

                is                                         and though at

a similar origin with the Dunblane one, and may rise from the
red sandstone which appears to form the first rock on descending
from the primitive rocks, and to extend over all this district.

                                  is                                Com

operation of the Pitcaithly water, in the sensible effects it pro
duces, is diuretic and purgative.
    The gaseous impregnation of the water could be' examined
properly only at the spring, which I had not the opportunity of
doing.      But having procured a quantity of the water, I sub
mitted     it  to the same examination as in the preceding analysis,
to ascertain its solid contents.      The usual reagents produced the
following appearances :
 1 . The colours of litmus, violet, and turmeric, were scarcely af
       fected.      If there were any change, it was that of the lit
       mus becoming more blue, and that of the violet green ; but
       this was so slight as to be rather doubtful.      The turmeric
       underwent no change.
 2. Muriate of barytes produced a turbid appearance and preci
       pitation ; but this was much less considerable than in the
       Dunblane water.         The transparency was not restored by
       nitric acid.
 3. Nitrate of silver produced a very dense and copious precipi
       tate.
 4. Water of potash gave a milkiness not very considerable.
 5. Carbonate of potash threw down a copious precipitate, which
       disappeared with effervescence on adding nitric acid.
 6. Lime water had no sensible effect.
 7. Ammonia, when perfectly free from carbonic acid, caused no
       turbid appearance.
.8. Oxalate of ammonia produced an abundant precipitation.
 9. Tincture of galls, added in a very minute quantity, did not
       immediately produce any effect ; hut after a few hours, a
       dark colour appeared, which gradually deepened, inclining
       to an olive-green.
     With all these tests, the general results are the same as those
 from the operation of the same tests on the Dunblane water.
 In experiment 7th, the ammonia, if not perfectly free from car
 bonic acid, produced a slight turbid appearance; and even when
 in its purest state, a very slight opalescent hue was perhaps ap
 parent : but this obviously depended on the presence of a little
 carbonic acid ; for when a drop or two of nitric acid was pre
 viously added, and the water heated, no such appearance was
 produced ; or, if boiled strongly, without any addition of acid,
 on restoring the original quantity of liquid, by adding distilled
 water, the transparency was not in the slightest degree altered
 on adding pure ammonia.           The slight precipitate, too, which
 did occur in any case, was dissolved by the most minute quantity
 of muriatic acid with effervescence ; and this solution became
turbid on adding oxalate of ammonia, proving the precipitate to
have been carbonate of lime.

          the   Mineral Waters of Dunblane and Piicaithly.              277
     The same general conclusions, then, with regard to the nature
of   the ingredients, are to be drawn from the preceding results as
from the application of the same tests to the Dunblane water.
They suggest of course a similar mode of analysis.  I preferred
the second of the methods above described, as being the most
simple, and easy of execution.
   An English pint of the water was submitted to evaporation.
Before the matter became dry, numerous cubical crystals were
formed, indicating the presence of muriate of soda ; when dry,
the solid matter entered readily into fusion with effervescence,
denoting the predominance of muriate of lime.           The drv matter
was highly deliquescent.        After exposure to a heat inferior
rather to redness, it weighed while warm 35 grains.
    This dry matter was redissolved in about ten times its weight
of distilled water. A small portion remained undissolved, which
being washed and dried, weighed I '2 grain.             A little diluted
muriatic acid dropt upon this, excited slight effervescence ; but
the greater part remained undissolved, and weighed, after wash
ing and exsiccation, 09 grain.        It was sulphate of lime. A
Tery thin crust adhered to the sides of the glass globe in which
the last stage of the evaporation had been performed.           This was
dissolved with effervescence by diluted muriatic *cid, and the
solution became quite turbid on adding oxalate of ammonia.
The quantity of carbonate of lime thus indicated, adding the
portion abstracted, as above, from the sulphate, cannot be esti
mated at more than 0-5 grain.         These results were confirmed
by precipitation from another portion of the water by muriate of
barytes, the proportions indicated being nearly the same.
    The liquor poured off from the insoluble residue, being diluted
with distilled water, oxalate of ammonia was added to         it, as long
as any turbid appearance was produced       ; and after the subsidence
of the precipitate, the liquor was boiled       a little, to render the
decomposition and precipitation complete.             The clear liquor
was then evaporated to dryness, and the dry mass was exposed
to heat, to volatilize the muriate of ammonia, the product of the
action of the oxalate of ammonia on the muriate of lime             ;  the
heat being continued as long as any vapours exhaled, and at
the end being raised to redness.         The muriate of soda thus
obtained, weighed 13*4 grains.       By solution and crystallization
it was obtained in cubes.
    The precipitate of oxalate of lime having been thoroughly
 washed, was exposed in     asand-bath to       heat short of redness,
                                                a

 dry;
       it it
           weighed 23'8 grains.      The portion of muriate of lime
 equivalent  to any quantity of oxalate  of lime, cannot, as has been
 already remarked, be exactly assigned} from the difficulty ofbring-

     ing the oxalate to one uniform state of dryness. But, according
     to the most accurate analyses, 23*8 grains of dry oxalate are
     equivalent to 20 grains of dry muriate.            To avoid any error,
     however, the oxalate was converted into carbonate of lime by
     calcination; and this decomposed by muriatic acid, afforded
     19-5 grains of dry muriate of lime.
        The proportions, then, of the saline ingredients in an English
    pint of the Pitcaithly water, are, according to this analysis,

    much accuracy by actual experiment.

       tility and Absurdity of the Attempts, at applying to the same,

       By Mr. John Farey, Sen. Mineral Surveyor.
                                To   Mr. Tilloch.
   Sir, — It      should not be forgotten, that Dr. Gilby, in p. 300
   of your last volume, untruly charged me, with having " alluded to
   no writer who had noticed the fact," of the unconformableness of
   the Red Marl on the Coal-measures of a part of Somersetshire,
   and, quoting Professor Jameson's authority, for as unfoundedly
   appropriating to himself this discovery (of near a century old) ,
  took occasion, thereupon, to commence an unprovoked attack
  Upon me ; for which he has not apologized in his Letter at p. 182,
  as candour would have dictated : but seems to think it sufficient,
  to charge on the garbled account of a brother Geognost*, the
      * Another of these garblings of the papers in the Philosophical Trans
  actions, is to be found in p. 296, of the 2d Edition of Williams's " Mineral
  Kingdom," where the mention, of the Faults not being visible in the form of
                                                                   I
  the surface of the South Wales Coal-basin, is wholly omitted !: first learned
  this, from p. 129 of Dr. Kidd's Geology.
                                                               * ignorance,"

    ignorance," which led him into those improprieties : and so
far from appearing to think it necessary, to apologize for the
use he had thus made of Professor Jameson's Name, again speaks
on the same subject (p. 183) by his authority and permission!.
     In page 188, Dr. G. unhandsomely charges me, with wishing
to introduce confusion, as to the Geology of England : — Jf
having been the first to bring forward more facts than any one
else, regarding the stratification of our Island, and having occa
sionally drawn the Inferences that these seemed to me to war
rant, be manifestations of the design with which the Doctor
charges me, I must plead guilty thereto (although I may now
further thus offend) : — but fortunately for me, the Doctor's Letter
sufficiently shows the source of all the confusion of which he
compkins, viz. the rashness and pertinacity of himself and
brother Geognosts, in their attempts to garble and bend the
facts of the British Stratification, to suit their favourite German
Theory:—|t vain attempt, I venture once more to        assure them.
     The Doclbr in his last communication, p. 185, affects to com
plain, of "perplexing language and confused description," in
my Account of the Strata of Derbyshire: and this apparently,
because I have not written in the fashionable (Anglo- Wernerian)
jargon, although the same would have been quite unintelligible to
the people of the County, for whose use, principally, the Report
 was intended by the Board of Agriculture, who printed it : the
Doctor might, however, have learned from p. 305, of your
 xlist volume, that the very learned Geognosts who sat in judge
ment upon, and ultimately rejected a very detailed account of
 the Strata, regarding which he seems yet in such perplexity, (see
 vol. xlii. p. 55 Note), so far from alleging the unintelligibleness
 of my descriptions, of the Coal-measures in particular, have
 pronounced them to be,
                               " the independent Coal-formation" !
 and surely, to this authority, all good Geognosts ought to boVv
 with reverence : I will however take the liberty of dissenting
 from their decision, and of maintaining, that the name itself,
 with every -effort at defining this independent formation, which
 I have seen, are as truly ridiculous, as the attempts have been,
 in England or in the South-west parts of Scotland, at applying
 it to particular Coal-fields : — the independent Coal-formation,
 belongs to
               " the ideal world of Werner," and not to any part
 of Britain, I believe.
     It seems rather extraordinary, after the facts which I have
 mentioned in p. 166, of your last volume, that Dr. G. should
 assert p. 183,
                  " the measures accompanying the Coal," in Der
 byshire, to be
                   " quite different from those usually associated
 with the Coal in England :" — the identity of all of our British
                                   S4                           Coal,

280      Derbyshire Limestone and Coals, are elsewhere found.
Coal-fields with each other, except those belonging to the Clunch
Clay (mentioned in the note p. 100 of vol. xxxix., and p. 256,
and 2,'>7 of vol.xliii.), is to nie now sufficiently made out ; and the
same with respect to the Derbyshire-peak Limestone,underlieing
each of these several Coal-fields ; and the fossil Shells in this
Limestone, which Mr. Sowerby has described in the 1st volume
of his " Mineral Conchology," go far I think towards proving this
identity. .
     The" Authority with Geognosts, against whom they seem to
admit no appeal, M. Werner, has given contradictory accounts
of the place, in his system, or of the formation, to which the Der
byshire-peak or mountain Limestone is to be referred, as ob
 served in the note onp. 2- 8, of my Derbyshire Report: so also,
 the next greatest Authority with these Gentlemen, Mr. Jameson,
 after stating the Toadstone interlaying these Limestones to be
 transition (Geog. iii. p. 149), now, if we may credit Dr. Gilby
 (p. 18.'}), considers this Limestone to be first Flcetz!, see also
 Dr. Kidd's Geology, p. 115. The Geognostic Committee on
 my Description of these Rocks, seem to have been awed by the
 contradictions above mentioned, from venturing to pronounce, on
 the formation to which they should belong : but Mr. Bakewell,
 Dr. Kidd, Dr. Prichard, and others I believe, have since given
 their Opinions ; and it may I think justly be said, that respecting
 this, and every other particular Rock in England which has been
 claimed by the Geognosts, as belonging to one or other of their
 Formations, such a mass of complete contradiction now appears,
  as to render the subject quite ridiculous, and soon will render it
  contemptible,      if they persevere.
      Dr. G.     seems to take it      for granted (p. 1S4), that what he
  chuses   to   denominate    the    "  old red sandstone," occurs univer
  sally, between the Derbyshire-peak Limestone and the coarse
 slate : yet, 1 believe, that a sandstone rarely occurs in this si
  tuation: in all the very long course of the junction of these two
  Rocks in North Wales, which I have particularly mentioned in
  pp. 16o to 165 of your la>t volume, 1 believe, no instance occurs
  of sandstone in this situation : in like manner, in examiuing
  lately, the entire circuit of the Limestone* Rock, which underlies
  the shallow basin of Coal-measures around Thornhill in Dum
  fries-shire, a circuit of near 30 miles, a thick whin or basaltic
  rock, and not sandstone, is everywhere found, interposed, be
  tween the Limestone and the coarse Slate.                I cannot find that
   . * Its tire greater
                         part o!' its range, this Rock proves unfit for the lime-
  burner'? purpose, ami is called Dogger : as happens also in Anglesea, to the
  SW of Ceint, and more locally, in the quarries S of the g'rea't Pontcyssyllte
  aqueduct, and other places.
                                                                              Mr.

              Sandstone does not invariably cover Slate.              281
 Mr. Jameson has noticed this remarkable Rock, in his Survey
 of this County, unless we admit him to have classed it as newest
fioetz (although underlieing what he calls the Independent Coal'
formation!) : it is true, in p. 79, he tells us, what members Wer
 ner says this latter formation consists of, and this Rock having
 no place there, it may from this circumstance have been over
 looked : — an ideal and a real thing, will not always correspond ex
 actly : and theory, we have been told, sometimes blinds observers.
     I do not pretend to say, that Sandstone         never found in the
                                                     is*

 should add, that in the southern part of its eastern side, no such
 rock was visible, but in its place,        basaltic kind of rock, very

     The very probableerrorsof Mr.W. Forster and of Mr.Bakewell's
 Sections, in placing red sandstone under the metalliferous Lime
 stone of Cross Fell, have been pointed out, in the note on p. 172
 of your last volume and in p. 458 of the Appendix to Mr. Bake-
                       ;
 well's Geology, 2d Edition (subsequently printed) the justice of
 this remark seems admitted: and Mr. B. here and pages 369,
 397, &ci concurs with me in saying, that sometimes only, sand
 stone   is  found in this situation, and not generally, as Dr. G.
 wishes to persuade    .
    It  seems, however, extraordinary, that Dr. G., after generally
 assuming, that red sandstone          to be found under the English
                                       is

   282             Wales not    (t priinitive Country.
      In p. 187 Dr. G. mentions North Wales, as one, of the only
  two situations in the main land of England (South Britain) where
 primitive Rocks occur: Mr. Arthur Alkin, in pages 42, 65, 191,
   199, 202, 217, and 219 of his " Tour," certainlv mentions these,
  and in pages 99, 130, 209, 211, 214 and 215 .vpcaks also of
   Granite, among the minerals of the Principality. I believe how
  ever, from all I have seen, or could learn from others on the
 subject, that in the latter case, Mr. Bakewell (p. 398, 2d Edit,
  of his Geology) is right, in referring the granite mentioned, to
  loose or alluvial Blocks : and in considering the former theoretic
  deduction, to be quite unfounded: — if there be anything of con
 sistency or truth in the boasted Geognosy, the Copeland or Lake
  Hills of Cumberland, must surely be better entitled to the class
 of primitive, than any part of Wales ? : unless by the teems. " un-
 associated by the older Rocks," Dr. G. means, wanting some
 thing older than Granite ? — but, " Who shall decide, where
 Doctors disagree ?."
     In charging me, towards the bottom of p. 187, with the " in
 accuracy and confusion," of not knowing the relative age and
 situation of the Red Mail, to be more recent, or above the Coal-
 measures, Dr. G. forgets, that it was, for re-asserting this very-
 truth (which I had long before published), but which Professor
 J. (as he says) had fondly persuaded him, he might appropriate
 to himself, that he commenced his attacks uppon me : " I
 clearly see (says he) that it (the observation I had first genera--
 lized) is of considerable importance," &c.
     With whatever truth Dr. G. may charge Dr. Kidd, and others
 of his Geognostic brethren, with confounding the different Red
 Marls, or the red-ground and r«d Sandstone (as he chuses to
 call them, pages 184 and 188), he cannot fix this charge on
 my friend Mr. David Mushett, p. 50 of your xlist volume, much
less on myself, who in the Phil. Trans, for 1811, or p. 29 of
your xxxixth vol. p. 105, vol. xxxixth p. 54, vol. xlii. and on
 many subsequent occasions, have spoken of different red Marls;
 all of them, alike, imbedding or passing locally, into sandstone,
 and not therefore distinguishable from each other by this cir
cumstance.
    Dr. G. might here,     have    been   aware, that something more
was wanting, than a reference, to         " the truly admirable system
of Werner," or to any of its classes of formations or their mem
bers, to overturn what I have observed and written, regarding the
Red Marl, and its locally imbedded masses of Sienite, coarse
Slate, &c. in Leicestershire (not Derbyshire, as the Doctor
writes) : — when I may have examined the Malvern hills, I shall
be able, I trust, to speak of them less diffidently than in vol. i.
ju 152, and3 if necessary, it shall be with more truth : — often as

 descriptions have been given or quoted, concerning these Hills,
  I could not find these applying, to more then one side of them
  (the western), and which I consider, rather too much like hearing
 one side of a story.     If ever I should see the very hiqhlv impre-
 bable sight (p. 188), of a granite mountain .'5000 feet high, rising
 out of a gravelly plain: the Doctor may rest assured, that I am
 too well aware of, that grossest of absurdities, in his favourite
  Geognosy (Rep. i. p. 134 Note), to confound the alluvia of
 the plain, with strata of any kind: — certainly I do, and scores
 of others of my acquaintance do the same, most heartily despise
               <f
 every such        systematic arrangement,"      should they even issue
 from the university of Edinburgh (Dumfries-shire, p. 1 1 1), or the
 British Museum, (Dr. Rees's art. Flostz).
     I beg to solicit the Rev. Mr. Townsend's attention, and reply,
 to what Dr. G. says in p. 1S8, concerning Brandon Hill, and as
 to micaceous sandstone, being found in the upper Red Marl, in
 Gloucestershire:--! can assure him of its frequent occurrence
 in and near Derbyshire (Rep. i. 148, 460), and in very nu
 merous other situations (see also Dr. Kidd's Geo. pp. 10, 107),
 however the same may startle this stickler for "systematic ar
 rangement."
     In enumerating the beds of the Red Marl (p. 190), Dr. G.
 mentions, a coarse breccia or conglomerate, as the lowest of
 them : I beg to state, that I have never seen this to be the case:
 in all the long range in which the yellow Limestone (answering
 to the Doctor's limestone, breccia, or conglomerate, I believe,
as mentioned p. 342 Note, vol. xlv.) lieing unconformably over
 the Coal-measures of Nottingham, Derby, York, Durham and
 Northumberland Counties, a fine-grained sand, or soft sand
stone, invariably lays under the Limestone, or next to the Coal-
measures, as I have particularly mentioned in the note on p. 410
of the 2d volume of my Derby Report, concerning that County
arid its vicinity : and a Letter now before me, from Mr. Thomas
Fen wick, an eminent Coal-viewer in the Tyne and Wear district,
who is also the Director of a large Colliery at Garforth* in
Yorkshire, and who is therefore well acquainted with these di
stant eoal districts, mentions, that a similar sand of considerable
thickness, is always found under the edge of the buff or yellow
Limestone, after it passes out of Yorkshire, and traverses Dur-
    * From whence the first information came, of the unconformubh,iess of
the yellow Limestone and this Sand, as mentioned p. 167 and 174 of
vol. xlv.: of which curious facts, I have since had the opportunity of fully
satisfying myself, by an examination and mapping of part of the district ;
and my kind Friend Mr. James Porter, has undertaken to soon complete this
Map, and send it up for publication; it will establish the facts mentioned,
beyond all controversy.

   light straw-coloured free Limestone occurs : and then the upper
   Red Marl *, perhaps imbedding towards its lower part, the very
   irregularly coarse and irregularly stratified sandstone of Sher
   wood Forest?, &c.: — in short, much remains yet to be known,
   before Dr. G. can safely proceed in his favourite course, of sy-
   steuiizing ; before which, he will I doubt not see the folly, of
   dubbing our Strata with geognostic names and distinctions : —
   every Country must work out its own Geology, and not import
   it, read made.

   to p. 179 of my Report, and p. 253 of your xlivth volume, he
   may perhaps perceive, that something more than justice has
   been contended for, in this case, in behalf of his friend Mr. Jame
   son.     When   I   was in Sutherland, in August 1812, and had
   perfectly satisfied myself from very repeated and minute inspection
   of the conglomerate Rock there, of its true nature, had oppor I
   tunities of conversing with Sir Humphry Davy on the subject,
   and finding him most decided in the prevailing notions, as to
   the origin or mode of formation of these Rocks, and seeing that
   he daily passed     bythem, in his angling Excursions,      pressingly
                                                                     I
   invited him to devote an hour, to examining with me, the neivly
   exfiostd faces, whieh the blocks that had been recently cleaved,
   and quarries which had been opened,       by
                                              the parliamentary Road-
   makers, in this conglomerate Rock, so readily and numerously
   presented for our inspection   : but this he declined, and even ri-
-r diculed the idea and proposal, before the company we were             in
                                                                         !:

    By J. C. Prxchard, M.D.
                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,~-I observe in the last number of the Philosophical Ma
gazine and Journal, a communication by my friend Dr.W. H.Gil-
by, containing some ingenious geological observations, in the
cpurse of which he animadverts on a paper of mine which ap
peared some time since in the Annals of Philosophy, and imputes
to me an' opinion which is very different from that which I there
maintained. I was so far from considering the mountain lime
stones as belonging to the transition formation, that the professed
object of my paper was to ascertain the position, which they

revive the absurd notion, of a chaotic state of the Earth.   F. f.

mentator," in the Notes which he subjoined to Homo, thought he had so
expressed himse lf that he could not have been misunderstood.      He had no
Other aim than to state the opinions of others, tending to confirm the lead
ing idea of Homo. Mr. F. may for the offensive word chaos, read matter,
and expunge the word chaotic, without injuring the sense intended to be
conveyed by T.

  and the independent          coal-formation with which they are coil*
ueded, occupy in the          floetz series; and the conclusion     at which
  I arrived was, that they succeed the old red sandstone.
     Haying been induced to take up the pen, in order to remove!
 a misconstruction of my meaning, I am unwilling to lay it down
 again without adding a few observations on a subject alluded
 to in your last number, by a correspondent who subscribes him
 self " Homo," viz. the comparison of the epochs of creation as
 unfolded by geological researches, with that series of events which
 is recorded in the Genesis.             In the preface which Professor
 Jameson has condescended to prefix to Cuvier's Preliminary
Tissay, he has mentioned that the inquiries of naturalists have
 established many coincidences .between these successions ; and
 this has always appeared to me so manifest and striking, that
 I wonder at the misconception which appears to prevail on the
 subject.    The desire of removing this, and setting in a clear
 point   of view   the relations in question, is the motive which in
 duces me to trouble you with the following remarks, which, if
 you think fit, I beg you will insert in your excellent Journal.
    The whole of these relations depend upon the sense affixed to
the word day, as used in the Mosaic Cosmogony.                  It has often
heen conjectured, that in this place it designates an indefinite
portion of time, and is synonymous with our expression period.
But it appears to me that something more than conjecture may
be offered in favour of this interpretation.
    The Hebrew being the language of a nomadic people, who
 possessed few arts and still less of science, cannot be supposed to
 contain many abstract or general terms, nor does it in point of
 fact : consequently, when the Hebrew writers are in want of ge
neral expressions, they always adopt particular terms in a tro
pical sense.      And this is the way in which general expressions
were originally formed in all languages.              The word period it
self, in its first application     to time, signified a single circuit of the
sun.     Therefore, if the author of the Cosmogony had intended
to describe a succession of periods of indefinite length, he would
necessarily have proceeded in this manner, and would have used
some word which properly indicated a limited duration in a tro
pical acceptation.         The question which remains is, What par
ticular expression the Hebrews (and especially Moses himself) were
in the habit of applying in this indefinite way ; and the fact is,
that the word DV indicating day, is the very one of which they
made choice.         It is used indisputably in that sense in chap. ii.
yer. 4.
          " These   are   the generations of the heaven and earth when
they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth
and the heavens."           This passage has already bten quoted by
Mr. Parkinson.
                                                                            It

                        On the Cosmogony        of Moses,               287
      It is therefore clear that the term daywiW bear the setae of
  Vi indefinite period, according to the genius of the Hebrew lan
  guage.      That it was actually intended to be so received in this
  particular place, appears to me fully evident from the context.
  Those who do not admit the supernatural intelligence of the
  author of the Genesis will yet allow him a great portion of na
  tural sagacity and good sense, and will certainly acquit him of
  so palpable an absurdity as speaking of days in the literal
  meaning of the word before the creation of the sun.
      If this interpretation be allowed, the following series of facts
 is found to be detailed in the Genesis :
      1 . That the waters of the ocean for a long time covered the
  whole earth.
      2. That no organized being existed for a long time in this
  universal ocean.
      3. That the water had subsided before the creation of or
  ganized beings.
      4. That an indefinite period followed, during which the vege
 table creation was formed.          It is to be remarked, that this part
 of the creation was effected before the existence of fishes in the
  sea.
      5. That in. the next period the sea produced locomotive ani
 mals.       This is the precise meaning of the Hebrew word used
 in this place, as any of your correspondents will find by consult
 ing a lexicon, and it was so understood by the LXX.                   Zoo
 phytes and testacea are of course excluded from this class, and,
 not being enumerated, must find their place in the aera of the
 creation which belongs to beings lower in the scale than loco
 motive animals, viz. that appropriated to vegetables, to which,
 in fact, zoophytes especially have a strong analogy. The cita
 tion of birds is referred to the same epoch with that of aquatic
 locomotive animals.
    '
      6,. The creation of quadrupeds follows.            No reason can be
 assigned     for  placing  this event    later  in the series than the for
 mation of aquatic animals.; and           if the statement be confirmed
 by positive proof, the correctness of the history is so much the
 more striking.
      7. The creation of man was later than all the above-mentioned
events..                         ,
      Let us now try how far       these   facts ean be proved by geolo
gical phaenomena.
      j.  That the ocean covered the whole earth, cannot           be ques
tioned on any reasonable ground, because many of the highest
mountains are stratified, and strata are allowed by all to be de
posits from. a state of chemical solution or mechanical suspension
                                                                          in

288               On the Cosmogony    of Moses.
in water.    Besides, the rocks of which they consist often have
a crystalline composition, and crystallization can only have beeni
effected in water.    The Huttonians, indeed, pretend that fire
was the solvent: but then they find it necessary to assert that the
fusion was performed in some hot Tartarus or Pyriphlegethon be
neath the weight of the whole ocean.
   2. That no organized being existed in the universal ocean, is
evident from the total want of organic remains in the oldest class
of rocks.
   3. That the water had subsided before the creation of or
ganized beings, is evident from the primitive rocks occupying
the highest situations.   Had it been otherwise, they would be
found to be enveloped everywhere in a covering of floetz rocks
on mountainous tracts equally as in valleys and plains.
   4. That in the next period organized beings of the simplest
kinds were created, is evident from the series of formations con
taining these remains and those of no other creatures.       This
series begins with the transition rocks, and includes the moun
tain limestones and the rocks belonging to the coal-formation :
in fact, all those strata which in South Britain are found in an
inclined position. In the coal-formation we find impressions of
vegetable bodies in great abundance, and in the limestones zoo
phytes and testacea.
   5. That in the next period the sea produced locomotive ani
mals, is proved by our rinding their remains in the rocks which
succeed them above mentioned, viz. in the first horizontal for
mations which in England lie over the inclined.     Thus the lyas
limestone contains abundance of the remains of fishes and those
large marine animals which were erroneously supposed to be
crocodiles.   The remains of birds are so perishable that we
oould not expect to find many of them ; but Blumenbach and
Faujas St. Fond mention some specimens of them found in
marie slates, together with numerous impressions of fishes, which
seem to prove that they began to exist at this aera.
   6. The remains of quadrupeds are found only in strata which
are much more recent than all those above mentioned.
   7. That man was created at a later aera than all the above-
mentioned beings, is proved by a similar method.      The reason
why no human bones     are found even in the newest rocks,  is,
                                                             pro
bably, that all the rock-formations were deposited before the
creation of the human species.
 I   may observe, that modern discoveries in physiology confirm
this order of events. Animals only feed on animal and vegetable
matter, while vegetable bodies, and probably zoophytes, derive
nutriment from mineral substances.       follows that vegetables
                                        It
i

                     On the Cosmogony        of Moses.             289
 must have existed long before the animal creation, in order to
 prepare a store for the sustenance of the latter.  Physiology and
geology were equally unknown at the time when the Genesis was
written; and it is certainly a most remarkable circumstance, that
we find a detail of facts set down there, which accords so ex
actly with the results of recent discoveries.
    But if this coincidence is surprising in itself, it appears the
more so when we compare the Cosmogony of the Hebrews with
the notions on this subject that prevailed among other nations
of antiquity. We find invariably that all other speculations on
this subject arc founded on some fanciful analogy with natural
processes that are daily observed.       Thus the Egyptians pre
tended that the mud of rivers acted upon by the solar beams had
generated all animals, including men, as they assured Diodorus
that the mud of the Nile continued to generate rats even in his
time.    Many of the Greeks imagined that the world and all
things in it grew from seeds ; and the celebrated story of the
mundane egg, or the egg produced spontaneously in the womb
of Erebus, was another childish attempt to explain the origin of
the universe by a loose and fanciful comparison with natural
processes.   Just of the same character is that of Virgil ;
         "   Cum Pater omnipotens fcecundis imbrihus aether
             Conjugis in lift* grcmiuin descendit, et omnes
             Magnus alit vasto diffusus corpore foetus."
Nothing of this kind can be found in the Mosaic Cosmogony;
there is not the remotest attempt to explain the manner in which
any thing was produced.       For the sense attributed to " the Spirit
of God moving on the face of the waters" by Milton and some
modern paraphrasts, is altogether forced, and a pollution of tbe
simple and sublime sense of the texts.
   I will conclude by observing that one single fact seems to me
of more importance. than all the other inferences that can be
collected from geology, and that       is,
                                         the proof  itaffords that the

LII.   Means                the Development and Propagation
                of preventing
   of  contagionsTyphus.  By   M. Le Rotjx, Dean of the Fa
   culty of Medicine at Paris : published with the approbation
   of the French Minister of the Interior*.
It is ascertained   that every place in which any number of pa
tients  affected with contagious typhus have been immured, re
tains for a very long time in its whole extent, and still more in all
the furniture which has been used by the patients, deleterious
and contagious miasmata calculated to communicate typhus to
those who are afterwards doomed to inhabit the place.
    The method of disinfecting such a spot is very simple. It
consists in decomposing and destroying contagious miasmata ;
and this method is certain.     Chemistry has procured us these
means, and the healing art teaches us their application and pre
cepts which secure its success.
   To the use of the medicaments which ought to be employed
in different periods of the disease, acid fumigations onglit
to be added, which, by diffusing themselves through the air,
seize upon the putrid and contagious miasmata with which it is
loaded, combine with them, and consequently destroy their de
leterious properties.      .
    1. The fumigations of oxygenated muriatic acid according to
the process of Guvton Morveau, the efficacy of which has been
demonstrated by experience, ought to be managed in the follow
ing manner, in rooms not inhabited. Muriate of soda (common
salt) 90 grammes (three ounces), black oxide of manganese seven
grammes (two drachms).
   This powder is put into a capsule              of earthenware,            which is
                 * Annaks     df.   Chimie, tome xciv. p. 327.
                                                                 .   .   .   .   placed

                                                                .

    Sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) GO grammes, or two ounces.
    When the rooms are inhabited, these fumigations must be
made very slowly, and by small portions.                Into a capsule we
must put two or three pinches of salt, and pour in, successively,
some drops of sulphuric acid.             This must be repeated at least
four or five times in the course of the day.
    Disinfecting flasks are prepared by putting into a large flask
 120 grammes (four ounces) of muriatic acid, seven grammes (two
drachms) of black oxide of manganese, two grammes (half a
drachm) of nitric acid (common aqua-fortis) . The flask must
then be closed with its ground stopper, in order to open it oc
casionally, when it is necessary to destroy any putrid miasmata
diffused through the atmosphere.
    2. For sulphurous fumigations, a mixture is to be made of
equal parts of sulphur or flowers of sulphur and nitrate of potash
in powder; and we divide this mixture into small packets of half
a gramme (nine grains) each, which are to be thrown, when
wanted, on a charcoal stove.
    3. The nitric fumigations are made in a large glass vessel or
a shallow crucible,         in which we put from 15 to 20 grammes
 (about four drachms) of concentrated sulphuric acid.                 It is to
be placed on a sand-bath, which is to be slightly heated, and a
little nitrate of potash, in coarse powder, is to be thrown. into it
from time to time.           This salt is slowly decomposed : there is
an acid gas extricated, which slowly diffuses itself through the
atmosphere; and we may multiply those small apparatus in dif
ferent parts of a sick-room without incommoding it.
    4. With respect to the purification of bedding, bed-clothes,
&c. &c.- sulphurous fumigations are best. The evaporation of
vinegar, its projection upon live coals, as well as the combustion
of various aromatic substances so commonly employed, cannot
be considered as a means of disinfection.             All these substances
may    mask    the    smell  which   is exhaled   from  the secretions of a
patient,   but   will  not  destroy the   contagious  and  deleterious prin
ciple which supports and propagates the disease.
    When an individual is suspected of currying about with him
the germ of contagious typhus, he ought to submit in a naked
state to the fumigation No. 2, bathe, wash and rub himself, for
the deleterious miasmata may adhere to the surface of his body.
 He ought to change his clothes, and not to use those which he
    * The
           application of heat having no other effect than that of producing
 a more complete decomposition of the sea salt in the same time, the very
 slender object of ceconomy which results has not appeared in general to
 compensate for the embarrassment of a heating apparatus.

   For wards filled with patients, the fumigation No. 1, with
the modifications alluded to in No. 2.
   For empty vvards which have been occupied by typhus pa
tients, the fumigation No. 1 ; afterwards the walls and floors
ought to be scraped, white-washed with lime and water, the fur

   In the article of the precautions for preventing the origination
of typhus and arresting the contagion in its very outset, the in-
fitructions recommend the scrupulous employment, and several
times a-day, of the same methods Used in disinfecting wards. And
finally, all the physicians, surgeons, nurses, &c. are to undergo
fumigations every time they quit the ward.         This precaution
 ought to be strictly attended to, in order to preserve them from
 infection, and that they may not spread it when they leave the
hospital.
 LIII.   On a Substance   to which the Name        of Inuline      has been
            given. By     M. Gualtier       de   Claubry*.
jVl. Rose a few years sincet made known a substance Which
he extracted from the root of the elecampane {inula helenittm),
and which he regarded as a peculiar matter, which might hold
 a middle place between starch and sugar.
    No person, so far as I know, has repeated the experiments of
 M. Rose; but ehemists have ventured various opinions as to the
 nature of this substance.    M. Funcke, in a note on the analysis
 of the elecampane, speaks of the inuline, but does not say a
 word as to its properties |.
    Dr. Thomson regards it as a particular matter, and classes it
 among the number of the immediate materials of vegetables.    He
 proposed to give to it the name of inuline.   M. Tromsdorf also,
 regarding it as a peculiar substance, has called it alantine.
    Dr. Henry, considering it on the contrary as a substance of
 doubtful existence, places it among those bodies the nature of
 which is not well known.       He designates it by the name of
 elecampane.     M. Thenard in his work on chemistry assigns the
  same rank to it.
     Having had occasion to make some experiments on the sub-,
  stance discovered by M. Rose, 1 shall now detail them.

term.
   M. Rose assigns the following properties to inuline :
   It is iiithe form of white powder, insoluble in cold water                                    ;   it
issuspended      iu   it   by

                            :                                      extri                is
cated upon cooling':
   Alcohol precipitates inuline from its solution in a short time.
   When placed upon burning coal the inuline flows almost like
sugar:   a thick white pungent but not disagreeable vapour arises:
the smell resembles that of sugar when burning.
   When we heat the inuline in an iron spoon,               melts, gives       it
out  a  white smoke    ;  and when the spoon becomes red hot, the
inuline burns with a brisk and lively flame, and leaves but very                             a
small carbonaceous residue.
   On distillation', the inuline gives out      brown acid without any

   The nitric acid converts inuline into malic, oxalic, and acetic
acids.
   On repeating the experiments of M. Rose,          proved most of       I
the properties which have mentioned as having been discovered

   Water at 60° dissolves four or five times its weight of inuline:
we cannot bring the solution to the consistence of jelly, as with
starch, but the liquor    viscous when        highly concentrated.

   The inuline which     deposited upon cooling retains         great                   a
quantity of water, in which      may be melted
                                             it     raising the tem       by
perature.   On continuing      gentle heat, we obtain scales which
                                         a
appear grayish,  but which   give an inuline of    fine white, when       a
well pulverized.
   When we wish to obtain inuline in        perfectly dry state, we

inuline remains slightly coloured yellow, and retains     small por                 a

294                On   a new Substance            called Inuline.
   Potash dissolves inuline, but it does not form with it a magma
as it does with starch : when we add water, the solution takes
place completely, but the liquor is never perfectly clear.
   Concentrated sulphuric acid precipitates inuline from this so
lution.
    The inuline is dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid, which
becomes of a brown colour ; ammonia precipitates the inuline
from it ; water and alcohol occasion no precipitate.
    The nitric acid dissolves inuline in a cold state, and assumes
a slight yellow colour.    When heated we obtain, as M. Rose has
 observed, malic, oxalic, and acetic acids.
     The water of barytes precipitates abundantly the solution of
 inuline; the precipitate is white ; it is easily dissolved in nitric
 acid, and with difficulty in hydro-chloric acid.
     The solutions of lime and of strontian form no precipitate in
 the solution of inuline.
    The hydro-chloric acid is not sensibly dissolved in inuline, and
 does not form a jelly with             it,
                                 as with starch.
    When we boil 100 parts of inuline with four parts of sulphuric
 acid and a sufficient quantity of water, for twelve or fifteen
hours, we obtain        small quantity of sweet matter, but which
                         a
retains   a bitter taste.
    The infusion of gall-nuts precipitates the inuline from its so
 lution in the state of    grayish matter, which
                              a                         collected veryis

glutinous and elastic.'

tion; nor does    form any precipitate in silicated or aluminated

   In order to obtain inuline in state of purity, we must boil

    Distilled starch gives pyro-mucous acid and oil.
    Inuline does not afford the slightest trace of oil in this ope
 ration.

    The inuline is dissolved without giving jelly.
    Concentrated sulphuric acid carbonizes starch with extrication
of sulphurous acid.
    Inuline is dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid without
any smell of sulphurous acid, and ammonia can precipitate it
from this solution.
    As other substances, like starch, are susceptible of being con
verted into sugar by means of sulphuric acid, we cannot assign
this as a character inherent in starch.
    As to the property which Dr. Thomson regards as a distinc
tive character of starch, — that of forming with gall-nuts an inso
luble compound, — it does not appear that it ought to be ad
mitted, since Dr. Bostock has made experiments which con
tradict those of Dr. Thomson.
    There remains only the property of forming with barytes an
insoluble compound which inuline shares with starch ; but this
property does not seem of a nature to decide the identity of
those substances.
    We therefore think we may eonolude, from what has been said,
that inuline is a peculiar substance, that it cannot be con
founded with any other known vegetable substance, and that
it ought to be classed among the immediate materials of vege
 tables.

 In   our last two numbers we laid before our readers regular Re
 ports of the work performed by certain steam-engines employed
 on the mines in Cornwall, and which we have continued in our
 present number, showing the comparative advantage in point
 of ceconomy of fuel possessed by Mr. Woolf's engine over any
 other in use. Some of our readers having expressed a wish to
 be made acquainted with the arrangement of the valves for the
  two cylinders in his engines, we have in fig. 1. (Plate V.) given a
  complete section of the nozles and valves of the engines of his
  construction now working on the Wheal Abraham and Wheal
  Var mines, — those mentioned in the Reports above alluded to.
                                 T4                            A, the

296 Further Particulars respecting      Woolf's Steam-Engme.
     A, the large cylinder, B the little cylinder, each in its steam-
case.      The steam is admitted from the boiler into the steam-
case of the large cylinder by a communication at C, and there
is a communication      between this steam-case and that of the
sma}l cylinder, so that both of the steam-cases become part of
 the communication       between the boiler and the little cylinder.
D furnishes a communication for carrying back to the boiler any
 water that may be produced by condensation in the steam-case,
before the engine is got up to her proper temperature.
      E is the pipe from the steam-case to the engine, with its
 regulating valve.     F the valve-box; the spindle of the one valve
 working through     that of the other.   The passage for the steam
 from the case into the small cylinder is between the two valves.
  G is the valve that opens the communication between the bottom
  of the small cvlinder B and the top of the large cylinder A.
      H is the valve that returns the steam from above to below
  the large piston ; and I is the exhaustion valve.
      When the engine makes its stroke, the upper valve at F suf
  fers the steam to pass from the boiler (through the steam-case)
  upon the small piston; the valve G at the same time allows the
  Bteam to pass from the underside of the small to the upper side
  of the large piston, and the valve I opens to the condenser.
   These three valves open at the same instant of time.
      When both pistons arrive at the bottom these valves shut, and
   the lower valve at F opens to return the steam from above to
  below the small piston; the valve H doing the same to the large
  one, and the engine returns in equilibrium ; but the upper
  valve at F can be shut off at any part of the stroke, according
   to the load of the engine,
      Those who are conversant with steam-engines will perceive,
   from the passing of the steam as above described from the upper
   to the lower side of each of the pistons respectively, that the
   engines at Wheal Var and Wheal Abraham are at present work
   ing single.     Were these engines working double, the steam
   would on the down stroke be made to pass from the under side
   of the small to the upper side of the large piston, steam in the
   mean time coming in upon the small piston and the under side
   of the large being open to the condenser; and on the up-stroke
   steam would pass from the top of the small under the large pis
   ton, while steam was received from the boiler under the small
   piston, and the top of the large cylinder open to the condenser.
       Fig. 2 represents another method of arranging and applying
   the power of Woolf's engine ; for the arrangement admits of
   great variety of modification. The valves will be understood
   from the foregoing description of those of fig. 1 ; but the mode
   of working the engine fig, 2 is different.     In this the steam is
                                                                 made

           Polarization  of Light    at Surface   of Melah.        297
made to act first on the upper side of the small piston, the un
der side of both being then open to the condenser.          (N. B. The
upper side of the large piston is in this arrangement always kept
in open communication with the condenser) : of course the large
piston descands in equilibrium, both sides of the large being open
to the condenser.      When both pistons reach the bottom, the
exhausting valve is shut, and the steam from above the small
piston is sent under both pistons, and both ascend ; — the upper
side of the large, as before observed, being open to the condenser,
and the small piston ascending in equilibrium. When they reach
the top, the under side is again opened to the condenser, and a           .
fresh supply of steam admitted on the piston in the small cylin
 der, and the stroke is again repeated.      In the engraving the pipe
 A a, which is the communication between the top of the large
 cylinder and the eduction pipe, is broken off at a, for the pur
 pose of showing the lower valves, but is actually continued to
 and joins the eduction pipe at B.
     Fig. 3 is the same in arrangement as fig. 2, only the action
 of the power is reversed — the valves which in fig. 2 are at the
 top of the small cylinder being here placed at its lower end.
 LV. Determination of the Laivs         according to which Light is
     polarized at the Surface of       the Metals.       By M. Biot.
     Extracted from     a Memoir    read  to the  Institute on the lath
     of May 1815*.
  When       Malus had discovered the polarization which light un
  dergoes on being reflected at the surface of diaphanous bodies,
  he also ascertained that this phaenomenon is not produced, at
  least in the same way, on the surface of the metals.        Since that
  memorable epoch in science, he returned twice to this singular
  exception; but without doubt, if time had not been wanting, he
  would have seen the propriety of modifying the first ideas which
  he published, and the true laws of the metallic polarization would
  not now be a desideratum.
      Several facts have since been added to the results of Malus.
   I have shown in my work upon Light, p. 137, that in general two
   kinds of reflections take place at the surface of coloured bodies :
   one, which seems to take place outside of the bodies, acts indis
   criminately on all the luminous molecules, and produces a white
   ray, if the incident light be white ; the other, deeper seated,
                    * Annates de Chime, tome xciv, p. 309.
                                                                     acts

298    Determination       of the Laws     according   to which    Light
acts solely on the luminous molecules which compose the peculiar
tint of the body.       The first, under a certain incidence, polarizes
in a great measure the light in the direction of the plane of re
flection, after the manner of diaphanous bodies ; the second, on
the contrary, does not produce this effect, or at least produces
it with a much less intensity.            Hence it is easy to conclude,
that if we place a glass       so that   it  may transmit or absorb the
first species of light, it will reflect the other ; and we shall see
the body in its own colour, without any mixture of foreign white
ness.     Such, in fact, is the process which I have employed in
the   work   cited, in order to bring out the peculiar colours of gold,
iron, arid copper.        But I thought then that the portion of light
of which these colouis are composed issued from the bodies with
a polarizatiou completely confused.             M. Arago has informed
me that a very considerable portion issued from all sides, po
larized parallel to the surface of the body and perpendicular to
the plane of emergence, which, in fact, I have since had an op
portunity of verifying.        We knew nothing more as to the mode
of polarization which the metals exercise, when Mr. Brewster
wrote me, that by reflecting several times on laminae of silver or
 of gold, a streak of light already polarized, this light was so
modified, that on analysing it with a prism of Iceland spar it
was divided into two fasciculi differently coloured.               I exerted
 myself   to verify  this remarkable    observation  ;   and   the  better to
 distinguish    the nature  of  the  tints,   I made   to fall  upon the la
 mina; a streak of white day light previously polarized in black
glass ; then by varying the incidences of the rays on the la
minae, it was easy to ascertain that the tints, into which the fas
 ciculus reflected was divided, were precisely those of the coloured
rings reflected and transmitted which were observed by Newton;
 and that in this respect, as well as from the direction of the po
larization, these phaenomena followed absolutely the laws of
moveable polarization observed in the thin crystallized laminae.
 I communicated this analogy to the Institute on the 27th of
 March last, in giving an account of the new discovery of Mr.
 Brewster, and I instantly communicated it to that gentleman
 also.    At the present moment multiplied observations put me
in a condition of establishing it with greater certainty, and of
proving that silver as well as the other metals modify the light
which they reflect, precisely as crystals endowed with double re
fraction modify those which they refract ; the number of succes
sive reflections answering to the greater or less thickness of the
 crystal. — Such is the object of the paper I now present.
    But by an accident which ought not to surprise in a field of
 inquiry so new, it happened that I at first observed different
phaenomena, at least in appearance, from those seen by Mr.
                                                                    Brewster.

              is polarized at the Surface    of the Metals.          299
Brewster.       In fact, he described the tints of the reflected images
as succeeding each other by simple alternations       from the greatest
to the smallest refrangibility, whereas I therein ascertained evi
dently the whole series of the rings reflected and transmitted.
He indicated these tints as polarized, one in the plane of refrac
tion, and the other in the perpendicular direction ; whereas I
found them polarized at equal distances from this plane, the one
in the direction of the primitive polarization, and the other on
the opposite side, conformably to the theory of oscillations: hence
it followed also that a single reflection upon silver could not im
press on the natural light any determinate polarization.         Having
spoken to M. Arago of this apparent contradiction, he assured
me that he had observed that the light reflected by silver, like
the other     metallic   bodies,  always experiences a very 'sensible
partial polarization, according to the plane of incidence ; and he
gave me a piece of polished silver on which in fact I could as
certain this property.         This seemed to agree with the indica
tions   of Mr.   Brewster,   and to be contrary to mine.    But as facts
can never be really contrary to facts, I inquired what could be
the difference in the elements of the two observations ; and I at
length thought that the different nature of the polish might have
 an influence on the mode of polarization exercised by the me
 tallic laminae.     This was in short perfectly confirmed by ex
 perience.
    We may give a polish to a metal in two ways, viz. by the ham
 mer or by friction.       The first mode consists in beating' the me
 tallic plate on a polished anvil with a polished hammer ; after
 which a lustre is given to its surface by rubbing it with glove-
 leather impregnated with a very fine polishing red.           This pro
 cess when applied to silver gives it a very fine whiteness; but the
 images are always a little undulated, and as if frothy at the edges.
  In the abundant reflection of light which takes place, we do
 not recognise the lively and brilliant polish of looking-glasses.
    The polish by friction is that which is given to telescope-
 mirrors : they are first rubbed on a stone of a very soft grain
 (hone-stone), and a brilliancy is^iven to their surface by rubbing
 them on pitch coated with putty of tin.         Then, if the operation
 has been well conducted, the images are well defined, lively, and
  the reflection has all the specular appearance.
     Now, by a very remarkable circumstance those two kinds of
  polish do not act in the same way upon incident light.              I do
  not speak here of the quantity more or less considerable of light
  which the surfaces reflect, but of the mode itself in which they
  act upon the luminous molecules, and of the direction in which
  they polarize them.        When the surface of silver or of any other
  metal has received      the specular  polish, it produces by regular
                                                                reflection

300          Determination   of the Laws according    to which
reflection   two distinct effects. It impresses in   the first place on
a part of the incident light the polarization moveable around
the plane of incidence ; that is to say, it causes to oscillate the
luminous molecules on both sides of this plane, in the same way
as a thin crystallized plate or one of weak polarizing power
makes them oscillate <:n both sides of its principal section ; and
in both cases equally the tints pass through the whole series of
reflected and transmitted rings of Newton.            But besides, the
metallic surface imprints on a white portion of the incident light,
the fixed polarization in the plane of incidence, in the same way
as a thick crystallized lamina, or one of energetic polarizing
force, gives to the light which passes through it the fixed po
 larization, in two rectangular directions ; and in the same way
 as in all crystallized     bodies I have shown that the luminous
 molecules pass progressively from the moveable to the fixed po
larization, when they have penetrated to a certain depth, in the
 same way in every reflection between metallic laminae we ob
 serve that a part of the light which had undergone the move
 able polarization in the preceding reflections, takes the fixed
 polarization, which it can never afterwards quit if the reflecting
 laminae are parallel ; so that in this case, after a number of re
 flections, more or less considerable, according to the nature of
 the metal and that of the polish which was given to            it,
                                                               we ought
  to find, and in fact we do find, almost the whole light polarized
 fixed according to the plane of reflection.    In the reflection upon
  steel, and probably on the other metals which take          very lively
                                                            is a
  specular polish, the portion of white light which          thus taken
  off from the moveable polarization   is incomparably the strongest;
  so that the -phaenomenon of the colours which the moveable po
  larization can alone produce becomes insensible, or cannot be
  perceived but in certain peculiar positions which theory alone
  can point out.      Thus Mr. Brewster has announced that thia
  phaenomenon had not taken place upon steel and upon the alloy
  which is   used for mirrors  ; butby  guiding myself     by
                                                            the indica
  tions of theory,   I  succeeded in observing it in a manner not to
  be doubted, even upon the best polished steel.        When we em
  ploy  laminae  of silver which have received the specular polish,
  the portion of the light which takes the fixed polarization at
  each reflection    isstill more considerable;  but  it   nevertheless
                                                           is
much less than upon the two metals which          Ihave cited   by a  ;
necessary compensation,     the  portion which   takes the moveable
polarization    greater, and the phaenomenon of the tints then
                is
becomes finer and more easy to observe.        But the direction of
polarization of the white fasciculus being precisely intermediary
between those of the coloured fasciculi,        results that
                                               it                also it
mixes  with  them         in
                       the refraction operated        by
                                                     the rhomboid;
                                                                           and

        Light is polarized at the Surface of ihe Melals.            301
and it is only by refracting them in peculiar directions that theory
indicates, that we may show plenty of evidence for the law of
their tints. In short, this difficulty almost entirely disappeared
in the laminae of silver polished by the hammer.          Then the por
tion of light, which takes the fixed polarization at each reflec
tion,' becomes extremelv feeble comparativelv to that which pre
serves the moveable polarization, at least when we do not pre
sent the laminae to the incident rays under an extreme obliquity;
for we know that in this case all the plane surfaces, even those
which have been purposely unpolished, assume the specular po
lish. Thus by avoiding great inclinations, and confining our
 selves to few reflections,     the laws of moveable polarization are
 alone perceived, and the tints of the fasciculi which nothing al
 ters are developed with the greatest regularity according to the
 series of Newton's rings.         This case is fortunately that which
 first offered itself to my observations, and it served me as a guide
 to pass on to the more complicated case, in which the moveable
 polarization becomes less sensible, and the fixed polarization
 more considerable.         Now, since the only difference of a polish
 more or less smooth determines more abundantly the passage
 of the light reflected from one of those states to the other ;
  ought we not to conclude, that here, as in the crystals endowed
  with double refraction, the moveable polarization is also the first
  which is exercised, when the luminous molecules are sufficiently
  removed from the reflecting surface in order that the asperities
  of the latter should be insensible at the distance at which they
  are ?    But the distance always diminishing, and the effect of
  the inequalities of the surface becoming more sensible, it hap
  pens, if they are very little, that the reflecting force becomes
  energetic enough to give polarization to a great part of the lu
  minous molecules ; whereas, if the asperities are stronger, and
  consequently the reflecting power weaker, a greater number Of
  these particles continue their oscillations without being fixed.
  We have here, therefore, in the action of the bodies on light,
  the example of an effect analogous to those of capillarity ; for       if,
  as M. Laplace has demonstrated, the latter arc produced           by  the
   attraction  more   or less strong  whicha   body exercises  at  its sur
  face, according as that surface    is   plane, or concave, or convex,
   in the same way in the new phaenomena which        I    announce, the
   different configuration of the reflecting surfaces exercises on the
   luminous molecules   a    different mode of polarization.     But the
   phaenomena of capillarity     are  produced  by differences  of   curva
   ture appreciable to our senses, and even to our measures,        instead
   of our being obliged, in order to change the mode of action of
    bodies upon light, to produce undulations almost imperceptible,
    such as the unequal nature of the polish gives them.          Further,
                                                                         we

we might probably never have been able to obtain similar effects
in the ordinary phaenomena of refraction, because they take
place at distances too short i instead of their becoming possible
in the phaenomena of polarization, which, depending on the re
flecting powers, are exerted at distances much more consider
able, as I have proved in several memoirs.
LVI.     On the Gold of the Coast of Guinea, and Methods of ol-
.
     tainmg it in the Country.      By Denys De Montfort,
     Member of, and formerly Secretary to, the French Society
    for exploring the Interior of Africa*.
The       mountains in the interior of Africa contain in their sides
  great numbers of gold mines : they are very seldom wrought,
  however, the natives confining themselves almost entirely to
  collecting the gold-dust which is found upon washing certain
 earths which may be termed auriferous.             In many countries of
  this vast continent the earth is as it were impregnated with
  gold ; and not only do we meet with it in powder, but in consi
  derable masses.      This gold has formed and still forms the object
  of a very extensive and lucrative commerce r the natives of the
  interior bring it down to the inhabitants of the coast, and the
  latter sell it in their turn to the Europeans, who have given it the
  name of the GoldCoast, where it most abounds.              Sometimes the
 gold-merchants,       who   are   also slave -dealers,  treat directly with
 strangers, but the latter most frequently purchase gold which has
  already passed fr:,m nation to nation and through several hands.
  In spite of all the attempts which have been made, and parti
  cularly in latter times by the English, to penetrate into the in
  terior of Africa, this interior i» still very little known to us, and
  the city of Tombuctoo, — -that city which is said to contain an
. immense population, — is still problematical,         for we have nothing
  on the subject but the vague and lying assertions of some Moorish
  and African merchants.         Some of the latter undertake long voy
  ages,  which    frequently  last  upwards of a month. Being situated
  at two or three hundred leagues from the coast, thev penetrate
  as much further into the interior in order to procure gold, slaves,
  and elephants' teeth, which they deliver to the European vessels
  or establishments.       In short, these people are very mysterious
  in all their operations, and it is very difficult to obtain from them
  the slightest intelligence : not only their taciturnity, their re
  serve and jealousy, are obstacles, but their various languages fur
  nish others, for it requires an interpreter always to make one-

self understood.       Africa is so divided among tribes without
number, that we presume it would not be difficult to reckon
more than a thousand different languages, without including the
numerous dialects which are derived from them.              It is thus chat
we see arrive from the source of, the river of Volta, the mouth of
which is situated in 5° 55' north latitude, people who from tribe
to tribe, and from interpreter to interpreter, at length fall in
with the great island of Main, a kind of religious capital, which,
placed in the midst of the river, is still upwards of GO leagues
from the coast, and the inhabitants of which, almost all brokers,
and of course linguists, end by accompanying them to the sea
shore.
     Whether it is in small grains or in dust, the gold of Guinea
is extremely pale in colour, although very pure; and it greatly
resembles the filings of yellow copper, with which Negroes or
other cheats mix it fraudulently.       When a Negro plays this trick,
if he is discovered (and this is easily done by aqua-fortis), he is
instantly made a slave : a White man comes off a little better.
But the^e is still another fraud which a buyer must be upon his
guard against: this is when the gold has not been thoroughly
 cleaned ; and as the sand mixed with it is quartzous, the nitric
 acid has no effect on it : in this case it requires a keen eye, a
 glass, or even the crucible if it be at hand.          The gold-dust is
 the only part of this precious metal which the Blacks sell to the
 Europeans.       The lumps, of which there are some so large that
 the king of Assianti possesses one requiring four men to lift
 it, (the Negroes call these pieces " image gold,") are held
 sacred, and when they do not exceed an ounce in weight are
 bored to make necklaces and bracelets for the arms or legs.
 They know also how to work and melt them.                   The principal
 image    or  grand deity  of Akra   is a man's    head  of  solid gold, or
 perhaps     even a naturally   formed    mass   which has    assumed that
  form.
      The Black merchant      is always extremely skilful in this com
  merce   :  he knows  the price of what he sells with the utmost
 precision ; and that there may be no fraud, he weighs it himself
  with scales which he always carries with him. Formerly this
  trade was much more considerable than it is now: — we shall see
  the reason presently.
      The Negroes have in common with Europeans two ways of
  procuring gold, digging and washing.           The Negroes of the coast
   are washers only, while those who       live  among the mountains are
   essentially miners.
      The mountains of Guinea, at least those which we are ac

from these mountains, carrying with them stones and gravel,
which being torn from the higher rocks present the same ele

The first of these metals seems to have been sought for by Ne

pulation  is forced to provide for itself: for, notwithstanding the
enormous exportation of human beings being stopped, they have

being taken in war, from being insolvent debtors, from having
lost their personal liberty at play, or from being sold           their           by
parents*. As to malefactors and rebels, they are uniformly sold
 to Europeans.
    The Negroes, therefore, work only the auriferous sands and the
 gneiss or schistous beds and banks of granite, which constitute
 the base of their mountains, and which being friable are easily
 dug into.    If they attack the sides, they dig fosse in the first     a
 place from twenty to thirty feet in depth, on an indeterminate
 breadth, until they begin to be alarmed for the crumbling down
of the earth the gold, as being heavier than quartz, schorl, and

 ever, at the depth of three feet they had no Idea of using props

                                         Europeans, and nothing in
 the world could induce them to make a regular pit, or bray
 themselves uuder ground.       In proportion as they advance in the
work, the lumps are put into pouches fixed round their waists,
 and some miners get very rich, as they only pay the king       fixed             a
 and daily allowance.      In 1790, the king of Assianti had six
hundred slaves at work for him, each of whom engaged to sup
ply him with half an ounce per diem, and some of them had so
much good sense as to form        sort of company, and throw into a
                                               a
joint stock the fruits of their labours.       The earth thrown up
 during the digging      laid in heaps on the edges of the fosse,
                               is
where other miners, their wives and children, receive        in bags         it
and carry it   to the nearest river on their heads, for the Negro

  up to the   middle,   and  then  dexterously dipping in their bags, they
  wash and shake its contents, so as to make the gold fall to the
  bottom : they then pour off the sand and earth, and the gold-
  dust remains.
    As to the gold-finders on the banks of rivers and the sea-shore,
 they are less fortunate in their researches, and it is generally
 women who are thus employed.               They conduct themselves pre
 cisely like the mountaineers, who in their turn are more fortunate
 than those on the sea-shore : the latter collect in bags the sand
 thrown up by a tempest, and act precisely like the former by wash
 ing, &c. In general the price of gold is fixed in Africa, and never
 fluctuates: in Europe it is supposed to yield 25 per cent. profit.
    But it is not so considerable now as it has been ; for several
 African princes more powerful than others, and anxious to secure
 a monopoly, have compelled the weaker to renounce all searching
 for gold.     Thus the sovereign of Akim, who has been conquered
by the king of Assianti, dares not any longer work his rich
 mines : they used to furnish upwards of 80 ounces of gold per
week to the coast, i. e. nearly 5000 ounces of gold per annum.
    From what has been said, it is not to be wondered that the
English have attached much importance to exploring the in
terior of Africa ; and without admitting all the reports on the
subject to be true, it cannot be doubted that the precious metal
is very abundant, and that the mines may still be considered as
virgin mines, never having been visited by Europeans.
    In the year 1800 a Society was formed in France for ex
ploring Africa, and it soon consisted of 300 persons : but it re
ceived no encouragement from the Government,                     and fell to
pieces.     For my part, I had quitted it previously, on being ap
pointed mineralogist to the voyage round the world under Capt.
 Baudin.
    Certainly,     if France will consent to abandon for ever the
odious slave trade, our august sovereign will have it in his power
not only to promote greatly the welfare of his own countrv, but
the peace and tranquillity of Africa.            There exists no country
in the  world     so susceptible   of general  cultivation   : we know that
certain districts in Africa are fertile in corn, and grain of every
kind grows there intermixed with sugar canes lately introduced,
and which protect the grain from hail.                The plants of India,
Europe,     America      and   Australasia,   or the   fifth portion of the
globe,   will  flourish  there  in  perpetual spring, and the animals of
all climates can be easily naturalized. The Negroes, whose re
spect for the Whites is extreme, notwithstanding what thev have
suffered from them, will cheerfully give up their fields to be culti
vated by us. Hands, servants, and even slaves will not be wanting .

LVII.    Statistical Account of ihc Quicksilver Mines of Idria in
   Itlyria.    By M. Paysse, Superinlendant of the ManvJ ac
   tive (f Mercurial Productions*.
The     authors who have written upon Idria, and among whom
we may reckon Walter Pope, Edward Brown, Walvasor, Fre
derick Stampfer, Scopoli, Ferber and Hacquet, are generally
agreed as to the aera of the discovery of this mine, which they
date in 14?)/'.
   It is said that towards the end of the thirteenth century the
valley and basin of Idria were covered with wood ; that the si
tuation had a savage appearance, two peasants only having huts
there, and which were even far distant from each other.
   One of these peasants, who we are told was a kind of cooper,
having oue day placed a tub undeT a spring of water which
issued from the hillock on which the church of St. Trinity has
subsequently been erected, found at the bottom of the vessel,
when he emptied it, some globules of a white metallic substance,
which struck him with astonishment.            On returning home he
collected this substance, and carried it to a jeweller in the little
town of Bisihofflaach, about four leagues ofT.           The jeweller,
having ascertained that the substance was mercury, employed
every method of knowing from the peasant the place where he
found it : but neither promises nor rewards could induce him to
reveal his secret.
   What the jeweller could not effect was obtained by a peasant
named Cazian Auderlin, who promised to assist the discoverer
as a partner in working the mine.         In fact, these two peasants
began their researches ; and being contented with some very slight
excavations in the &chistous soil which contained the metal,
                                                                 they
soon ceased to find the mercury in a native state. and
                                                           they aban
doned their labours.
   Already, however, some peasants in the neighbourhood had
become acquainted with the labours of our two miners; and-
scarcely had the latter desisted, when the former, guided bv
views of interest, united, and undertook digging in their turn : but
being as ignorant as those who preceded them as to the nature
of the bodies with which the mercury was united in the bowels

              the Quicksilver Mines    of Idria in Ulyria.       307
of the earth, they   ceased their researches when they no longer
found this metal in the liquid state, or in the form of cinnabar.
   A company of mining adventurers succeeded, guided by the
hopes of better success, and instructed by scientific men, among
whom the names of Witig Tholhauser and Florian Thater occur.
 This company commenced a series of operations suited to 'the
state of knowledge at the time : they opened a vertical well for
extracting the produce (which is still shown by the name of St;
Agatha) on the side opposite to the first experiments.
   In 1510 the Venetians, in making war upon the people who
inhabited the Frioul, in which Idria is situated, seized the works
by force of arms.     This conquest, however, was not of long du
ration ; for soon afterwards Maximilian, emperor of Germany,
who was then at war with the Venetians, retook the country, and
restored the mines of Idria to the original proprietors.
   In 1525 a catastrophe destroyed the greater part of the re
sult of fifteen years labours.   A violent earthquake threw down
almost the whole of the galleries; mountains which skirted along
the valley were thrown down and precipitated into the torrent
called the Idrixa, the course of which was changed in some
places : and this unexpected accident mined the company of
miners.
   The next adventurers were from Saltzburg ; and about the
year 1572 the labours were resumed with new activity, and in a
regular manner.
   In 1575 the Archduke Charles of Austria took possession of
the mines as a conqueror, and he was the first who set
about creating a regular administration for the benefit of the
state.
   Francis Toichel, who was sent as deputy from the Govern
ment to establish    it,dug the vertical pit known     bythe name of
Santa Barba: he contrived furnaces       for separating  the mercury
from the substances which mineralize         itin the bowels of the
earth, and suggested the mixing of the sulphuret of mercury
with lime, in order to isolate the metal from the sulphur.         It
was he also who gave the first ideas of the fabrication of saline
mercurial productions.
.  The administration of Idria was then composed of presidenta
who was chief director, five counsellors, and     asecretary.
   In 1803 fire broke out in the inside of the mines, and oc
              a
casioned great damage but  ;    by the sage counsels of M. FihoW,
who then directed the subterranean works, its ravages were
stopped  by   introducing water into the interior.    Several persons
were suffocated in the act of assisting their comrades.       M. Vo-
rauer, sub-engineer, remained a long time insensible, but was
                               U   2                                at

 at length restored to   life; and M.Scherowitz the chief accompt-
  ant was dreadfully burnt.
     It was in 1809, as a consequence of the treaty of Znaim, that
 the mines of Idria as part of the Ulyrian provinces came into the
 possession of France; and the French administration lasted until
  IS 13, when the Austrians occupied these provinces by force of
 arms.
     The town and quicksilver mines of Idria are situated in 31°
 33' longitude, and 46° 16' latitude,. about twelve leagues north
 from Trieste, and twelve leagues north-east from Gorice.
     Under the Austrian regime, Idria was a seignory dependent
 on the circle of Adlerberg.
     Under the French regime, this seignory was a canton, and a
  mayoralty   composed as follows    :
     1.  Town of Idria.     2. Village of Lower Idria.    3. Hamlets
 of High Canomla. 4. Middle Canomla. 5. Lower Canomla.
 6. Carnitza.      7. Iellitsch Scheuwerk.      8. Tschekounig.      9.
 Woiska.      10. Magdalen abcrg.
     The extent of this domain is about two leagues and two-thirds
 of a league square, two-thirds of which are forests.
    When I was mayor in 1812, the population was 7060 — of
whom 4095 lived in the town of Idria alone.
  . The town of Idria is situated in an almost     conical basin.    It
 is partly built of the rubbish of the mine.
    A small valley which rises at the well of Sagoda on the Idrixa,
 and which terminates at the mouth of the Canomla in Lower
 Idria, gives a course to the torrent of Idrixa.   This torrent takes
its source in the Julian Alps, about three leagues from the town.
After passing through about nineteen leagues, and operating its
junction with the torrent of the Canomla near Lower Idria, it
throws itself into the Isonzo near Canale, not far from Gorice.
    The small torrents of the Trebuschanka, the Zalla, the Nicova,
 and some subterranean springs which flow near the mill of Sa
 goda, at least double the volume of the waters of Idrixa.     With
 out these kinds of springs, which are very abundant in all seasons,
 and which alone are sufficient for putting in motion the various
 wheels of the above mill, it is certain that the workmen of the        .
 Idrian establishment would want a moving power during sum
 mer, in order to put in motion the hydraulic wheels of the ma
chinery for the mercurial preparations.
    The torrent of Canomla (already mentioned) is greatly in
creased by the waters of the torrent of the Woifschiack, and bv
 those of some subterranean springs which issue near the mouth
of this last torrent.
    The little valley of Canomla is more open and more extensive
                                                                  than

             the Quicksilver Mines     of Una in Illyria.         309
than that of the Idrixa ; there are more cultivable grounds, and
 particularly meadows, in it.
   Sluices for retaining the water destined for floating the tim
ber necessary for the service of the mines have been made on
several of those torrents ; and the French during their short ad
ministration erected one on that of the Woitschiack, which is
distinguished from the rest by its solidity and elegant construc
tion.    It was just finished under the care of General Andreossy
when the French evacuated Idriaiu 1813.
   Among the torrents which swell the Idrixa, there are none
truly permanent but those of the Canomla and the Zalla, and
even the latter is often dry in summer.
   The narrow valley through which the Idrixa flows is bounded
by two chains of mountains, the mean height of which measured
barometrically is about 288 fathoms.         They are in general cal
careous,    of  the  kind  called  transition.  All these calcareous
masses are frequently intersected by very much inclined strata
of argillaceous schistus, particularly in the environs ofBas Jdria.
These schists sometimes contain very thin layers of beautifully
white laminar quartz, and frequently also carbonated lime.
   In other parts there are schists strongly depressed, reticular
and curvilinear, in thicker strata, mixed alternately with quartz
and carbonated lime of a decided whiteness.        Every- thing shows
in this singular arrangement, that these various strata have un
dergone a slow or instantaneous pressure at the moment of their
formation, and at epochs when these masses still possessed a
certain degree of softness.       This formation is particularly re
markable at the back of the mountain, the interior of which is
mined, and which overhangs the canal the water of which feeds
the pumping engines of the wells of St. Barba and St. Agatha.
We find it also in the section of the chain against which the
furnaces are situated, and in the ravines made by the waters,
as well as in many other parts in ascending or ascending the
Idrixa.
   Banks of    a coarse gres,  and a kind of breche almost entirely
quartzons,   are seen on the road which leads from the church       of
St. Trinity to that of Calvary; parts       are decomposed by their
exposure to the air ; others resist its influence, and are not
changed by the action of the most violent heat produced by large
bellows.     Thick strata of an argilo-calcareous schist frequently
cover these siliceous masses.
   The manganesiated argil, In which we meet with masses or
detached pieces of sulphuretted iron, sometimes crystallized, are
often found exposed in certain ravines of these chains, which the
water produced by the melting. of the snows seems to have laid
hare.

    The mineralogy of the mayoralty, although not very rich or
various, nevertheless exhibits carbonated lime in great varieties.
We find also black and gray marble very compact and of very
close texture, as well as breches susceptible of a very fine po
lish.
    The 'valley of Canomla furnishes white marble ; saccharine
carbonated lime, similar to the statuary marble of Carrara, the
grain of which is not quite so compact; a carbonated lime con
taining alumine or stalactite in masses, a species of cavernous
tuf, very useful for constructing arches. We there also find marls
 and argils of various colours, adapted for the potter and brick-
 niaker ; amorphous quartz in banks, very considerable in the vi*-,
 cinity of Trebuschanka, and crystallized in the confines of Tol-
 mino and Walmistrate.      Jaspers of various colours in thick layers
 are found in the countrv of Woiska : they appeared to be in
 clined strongly on the side of the torrent of Trebuschanka,
where we observe their superficial decomposition in avery marked
manner.    There is also a kind of freestone (both fine- and coarse
grained) in the environs of the forest called Razore; coal free
stone (ares houilliers) in the little valley of Tschekourig, as well
as in the vicinity, where there have been excavations, and where
there are traces of fossil coal.                 . <U+2713>
   Calcareous tliumacheles susceptible of polish, shells agglo
merated by an argillaceous paste containing sulphuretted' iron,
which is decomposed in the air, accompany the substances which
have been extracted from the excavations practised at the time
of the search for coal.
   Amphibolic rocks and micaceous schists are found in several
 places,.
    Sulphurated iron inclosed in lumps in argil, oxide of the same
 metal, in this earthy substance, forming the luminous manganese-
 formed iron, is disseminated in the district of Pouschenick, in
 strata, the thickness of which has not been examined.
    Finally, native mercury combined with various matters forms
 the chief mineral riches of this country.
     I have already observed that the town of Idria was built at the
 bottom of the conical basin and over the subterraneous works.
 Its height above the level of the sea      is,
                                            according to the various
 barometrical measurements which       Ihave made, 169 metres.
    Although the town of Idria    is not regularly built, it never
                                                               is
 theless pleasing to the eye. The houses in which the workmen
 live, far from being distinguished    by  black and dismal look as
                                            a
 is usual in the vicinity of mines, seem on the contrary, from
 their external neatness, to indicate that the inhabitants enjoy
 ease and comforts not usual among this class of workmen in
 other countries.

                the Quicksilver Mines   of Idria in Illyria.          311
   Two or three principal buildings are here remarkable: — a fine
parish church, and a castle for accommodating the chief director
of the mines, and for containing the treasure ; the magazine for
the products of the mine; the hall of the council of administration;
and all the public offices ; a very fine granary or store-house for
 the inhabitants as well as for the workmen ; a very fine forge ;
some houses for those employed by Government, for the cur6
and his vicars, &c.
    There is also a public school with six professors, and a female
to superintend the education of the young girls ; a very fine
hospital, to which two physicians and a surgeon are attached,
and a dispensary for giving medicines to the sick.        These were
among the improvements executed under the inspection of the
 French.
    The situatiou of the town of Idria does not expose it to (he
tempestuous winds which are common on the shores of the
Adriatic.    The Borra and Sirocco, which are the most violent
of the season, pass above the chain which overhangs Idria, follow
the course of the torrent, and are consequently but very little
felt by the inhabitants : the air, however, is not stagnant ; for it
is constantly renewed in consequence of the vicinity of forests,
an active vegetation, and a rapid torrent.       It is remarked that
a current exists constantly in the atmosphere, from the direction
taken by the vapours which rise from the furnaces for the distil
lation of mercury, and those for the fabrication of mercurial
productions.
   The variations of the barometer are neither very frequent nor
very considerable at Idria.   The mean height of the mercury,
according to my observations for four years, on a barometer of
the diameter of eight lines, was 27 inches 5 lines*.
   The seasons are less inconstant at Idria than in many other
countries of the globe : they are generally rainy in autumn, very
cold and snowy in winter. Thunder storms are very frequent
during summer, and there are sometimes two or three in a day;
or rather the great atmospherical currents carry them there.
   The snow covers the mountains of Idria as well as the valley
nearly six months in the year, and is often five feet deep: the
great road from Layback to Idria is then intercepted ; sud the
administration is forced to employ three or four hundred work
men to clear       it,
                  in order to convey provisions to the popula

  the thermometer rarely descends to 15 degrees below zero of

 M r. Thomas        Forster has it in contemplation to publish, in
 the course of a few months, and to continue periodically, a work
 entitled " Journal tie Meteorologie, avec d' Observations sur les
 Phenomenes de I' Atmosphere," &c. &c.              Mr. Luke Howard
 and other meteorologists have promised their occasional assistance,
.The object of the work will be to publish journals of meteoror
 logy kept in various parts of Europe ; together with occasional
 essays on subjects immediately         connected with this science.
 The publication    and    the  period of the appearance of the first
number of the      work   will  depend on the success the gentlemen
 concerned in the work meet with, in receiving journals and other
 communications from abroad.           Letters on meteorology, notices
 of meteors and other occasional phaenomena, besides regular
journals, are within the plan of the work. The principal object
of this work is to collect accounts from abroad, and to commun
nicate to the continent the discoveries made in this country.
     Mr. Sowerby, the indefatigable naturalist, of No. 2, Mead
 Place, Lambeth, has published a most valuable Catalogue of
coloured Drawings of English Medicinal Plants, as a Companion
to the Materia Medica of the College of Physicians.             The in-i
tendon of Mr. Sowerby in his present undertaking, is to make
medical practitioners (whose knowledge of botany may not be
extensive) acquainted with all the English plants which they may
have occasion to use. We presume we shall gratify our medical
and scientific readers highly by selecting the catalogue of mushr
rooms, as divided into eatable and poisonous, which Mr. Sower-*
by has faithfully depicted in elegant coloured prints.         The me
dicinal plants, strictly so called, are fifty-two in number ; the
mushrooms are seventeen in number, fourteen of which are
eatable, and only three poisonous.          Many fatal accidents have

  Dr. Spurzheim has just published       a new edition of his Phy
siognomical System.       It
                          contains  a great deal of new matter, as
the Doctor has made very considerable improvements in the
science since his arrival in England.       Among the many dis
coveries which Gall and Spurzheim have made, none are perhaps
more curious than those relating to hydrocephalus, and its ef
fects on the structure of the brain.     In pages 157 and 158 of
the above work,   are some  very curious   observations relating to
the paper originally presented to the National Institute of France
in 180S, and on a paper read at the Royal Society in 1814, the
substance of which will be further discussed in a future number
of our Journal.

  Wh      y do men of science persist in saying that meteoric
stones fall from the heavens, as     planets could contain within
                                       if
their bodies    a force of projection superior to their force of
gravity, and capable of pushing their matter beyond the limits
of their attraction, or as   masses so enormous could be formed

in the air ;  where, beside, there exists no base of bodies as in
azote, without an extrication of air, felt over the whole globe,
being the effect of it.  We no longer hear of buildings, men, or

phaenomenon always takes place in open grounds, and where,
without finding much resistance, the stone may sink into the
ground : therefore, they -do not fall, but are formed of the sub
stance of the soil which the lightning puts in a state of fusion.
If this substance be pure silex, the stone forms rock crystal
rounded like flint.    If it be a mixed soil, the flux is also mixed,
and some of its oxides may by the force of the fire be reduced,
nay it is even compounded into metal. Let the stone be weighed,
and let us measure the metrical capacity of the hole which it
has formed ; the difference will not be great.
    " I saw 'when a young man a meteoric stone fall, as it was
called.   A globe of fire, flat in front and lengthening behind into
a tail, advanced towards me, gradually coming nearer the ground
until it was- at the distance of thirty paces : an explosion took
place on the ground, with a repeated cracking noise, projecting
 a whirlwind of dust into the air, and giving out a sulphurous smell
which affected me. After the dust was allayed, I approached
 the place where the explosion took place ; and I there found in
 a hole broader than it was deep, a stone partly gray, partly
brown, and which exhibited rather a conglomeration than a
flux ; and there was no portion of reduced metal found. I
formed at that instant the same idea of its origin which 1 now
entertain of all the other stones of that nature. I regarded it as
proceeding from the flux of the soil: supposing it to be of celes
tial extraction, it must have travelled in the centre of the in
 flamed globe, which would have been too grand an escort for a
stone so coarse. Subsequently I analysed this stone, which might
be a foot in circumference, and I therein found plenty of sand,
argil, lime, carbon, and iron ; I sent the remainder to M. De-
lametherie.    ft was on a road made across a heath that I found
this stone : it preserved a very strong heat for a long time.
    The sub-oxygenated chlorine of Davy, &c. which Gay-Lussac
had already obtained, may be regarded as an oxygenateof this body,
and which has elements as if chlorine and euchlorine were united
together.    The chlorine is a salt, in which the oxygen performs
the function of an acid, and the dry muriatic acid, the function
of an oxide: an addition of oxygen renders it oxygenule, and still
more renders it oxygenously dissolved: then it is in the state of
euchlorine. I say that in the chlorine the acid performs the
office of an oxide, because it is that which displaces caloric from
the oxygen ; the second oxygen also undergoes this displace^
ment; but the third oxygen must bring caloric, because it ought
to replace that which the muriatic acid has displaced from the
two oxygens, salification and oxygenulation : of this the solution
consists.
    " Berthollet has recognised    a state of chlorine in which   the
                                                             muriatic

 muriatic   acid is in hyper- combination to the oxygen ; it is an.
  oxygenate oxidinulated by the acid, and in which the excess of
 acid is saturated by the water performing the functions of oxide.
 The muriatit. acid gas is muriate of hydrose : by adding water until
 the acid undergoes no more displacement in its caloric, there are
 formed a muriate with excess of water and a true hydrinulated
 salt ; with still more water, caloric is fixed, and the acid be
 comes dissolved.        Chlorine ought to have its complement of
 oxygen, or be oxgyenously dissolved in its muriatic acid, in order
 to give physical marks of acidity : it is thus that, in sulphurated
 hydrogen gas, the sulphuric acid of the sulphur ought to be hy-
 drogenously dissolved in order to give the same marks; in the
 sulphur it forms sulphate of hydrogen ; in hydrogenated sulphur
 it is sulphate with excess of hydrogen, or hydrogenulated sulphate.
 The concentrated sulphuric acid is sub-hydrinulated sulphate of
 hydrose; with enough of water to prevent it from heating it is
hydrinulated sulphate of hydrose; and with still enough of water
not to cool any more, it is acid, or sulphate of hydrose dis
solved ; and so on with respect to the other combustibles and
acidifiable burning bodies (comhurans) and their acids.           I am'
impatient      to  be  made   acquainted  with  the  new  work  of   Si?
H. Davy, when completed.
    "  M. Kastncr informs me that he is about to publish a Journal
adapted to the use of the friends of manufactures in Germany;
and that he is drawing up for publication            at Easter, A Re
port    on the  Progress  of various Nations in Chemistry, which Re
port will be annual.       M. Kastner has made a great number of
experiments with iodine, which will appear in the next number
of Sehweiger's Journal.         Among other things he has found that
iodine is a reagent for sugar as it is for starch ; for while water,
a solution of gum, spirit of wine, vinegar, &c. turn brown with
iodine, the solution of sugar remains colourless; some cheese
like flakes merely being deposited.        It results that with those
two substances the oxygenated iodic acid forms oxygenated iodates
fully saturated, for it is only the super-combination which gives
the colour.
    "   When recently attendiug to the production of fulminating
silver by a nitric acid obtained from the acid of the residues of
sulphuric ether, I found out a favourable process for procuring
muriatic ether : Take a residue as from the manufacture of
such an ether ; add to it the half of the first quantity o/ alcohol,
and heat without boiling for an hour in a curved retort well
luted. Afterwards mix with the liquid which from acidinulated
sulfat of ether has become neutral sulphate, as much sea-sa!*
as the primitive sulphuric acid can decompose.            This acid i$

substituted for the muriatic acid, and the soda is substituted for
the ether, and the two displaced bodies unite with each other.
The ether obtained is liquid, and therefore hydrated ; but with
the help of calcined muriate of lime, we may constitute it in
part in the state of gas, which nevertheless is not entirely ex
empt from water, since its decomposition in a red-hot tube gives
muriatic acid gas : it also gives carbon allied to a combustible
which is probably the acidifiable radical of the muriatic acid,
since, being burnt in dry oxygen gas, it is converted into car
bonic acid gas and into muriatic acid gas,'*

years the Editor of an excellent Journal on Chemistry and other

He was preparing, in company with his colleague Mr. Rehland,
some arsenated hydrogenic        gas ; and whilst watching for the
full development of this air from its acid solution, trying at every
moment to judge, from its particular smell, when that operation
would be completed, he inhaled the fatal poison which has rob

    fc Mr. Editor, —
                       From a sense of the great benefits which
 society may derive from the following, we solicit a place in your
 valuable paper, so as to communicate our discoveries, for the
 general benefit of mankind, and of this province in particular.
 We think its utility will be universal throughout the whole con
 tinent of America, as it may be carried into effect so as to su
 persede in a great measure the consumption of candles and oil,
 whether in streets, warehouses, stores, workshops, or dwelling-
 houses ; it will be found beneficial to every rank and class of in«
 habitants.    The simplicity and easy expense of materials, and in
 constructing an apparatus to put it into practice, will, we trust,
 render it an object worthy of public attention. We took about
 six ounces of birch bark, and about two ounces of pitch pine
 knots, which we put into a metal tea-kettle holding about a
 gallon ; we secured the top with clay, to prevent the gas evapo
 rating therefrom : then placing the kettle on the fire, in about
Jive to seven minutes the current of smoke began to play out of
 the nose of the kettle, to which we applied a lighted caudle : it
 communicated with the gas as quick as gunpowder, and continu
 ed burning with a clear and bright light, equal to three candles,
 for the space of one hour and thirty minutes.        At the next trial,
 after cleaning the kettle of all the substances, so as to ascertain
 the effects of the bark alone ; we put ten ounces of birch bark,
 and lengthened the conductor with reeds, or rush-pipes, and
 applied a lighted candle as formerly to the current issuing from
 the pipes, and it continued to give a most beautiful light for^
 the space of three hours without ever burning the reeds. We
 observed that there was about one or one and a half inch of
 current between the reed and the flame. The longer the con
 ductor the more pleasant the light, so that from one conductor
 there may be a variety of lights, and that too may be carried to
 the distance of miles by means of a conductor.            Though the
 assertion may seem strange to some, to those who are any way
 acquainted with the nature of gas we are assured it will meet
 their approbation.
    "  Thus far, sir, we have detailed, and trust that future ex
 periments will give demonstrative proof of its utility.

     Messrs. Salisbury and Go. of the Old Buffery's Iron Worts
 near Dudley, have discovered a mode of preparing cast iron,
 which gives it toughness, flexibility and elasticity, promising most
 valuable results to . the arts, and to architecture both civil and
 naval, particularly in the construction of bridges.        Mr. Brande,
 of the Royal Institution, is engaged on a series of experiments
 to ascertain the comparative strength of common cast. iron,
 wrought Won, and the prepared cast iron of Messrs. Salisbury
 and Co., the results of which we expect to be able to lay before
  our readers in our next number.          In the mean time the trials
 which have been made by others of the prepared cast iron, have
 answered every expectation.

     Mr. Konig, on the authority of a letter from Baron Moll, of
  Munich, has announced (in Dr. Thomson's Annals of Philosophy
 for August last) that in October 1814 a mass of native iron
 Weighing     about 200 pounds was discovered by a shepherd at
  Lenarto, in the comitate of Sarosh, on the declivity of a smajl
 range subordinate to the Carpathian mountains.            Its colour in
 ternally is light steel gray approaching to silver.        It is covered
 by   a thin coat of rust : its surface is  uneven,  rough, and marked
 with impressions.      It presents three cellular cavities, but they
  are without the olivine-like substance found in those of the Si
 berian native iron.     The mass is irregular and flat, as if coin-
  pressed: its fracture is hackly, it takes a high polish, is perfectly
 malleable cold, and its solution' in nitric acid is of a light emerald-
 green colour.

 having no other means of communicating             to the University, at
 this season, what he conceives to be the greatest natural curio
 sity in the county, he has desired the Editor of this paper to in
 form his readers, that the said well is in all respects similar to
 the celebrated petrifying spring of Matlock in Derbyshire; in-
 crusting moss, rushes^ &c. with a deposit of carbonate of lime,'
 so as to exhibit a beautiful reticular stalactite.       Persons going
 from Cambridge are recommended, for a guide, to the cottage.

 LX.    Experiments tending to prove the Possibility of causing
     Balloons to deviate considerably from the general Direction
     of the Current of Wind which carries them along in the At
    mosphere.     By Mr. John Evans, Jun.
                             To    Mr. Tilloch.
Siu, — The numerous methods hitherto proposed for guiding
balloons    have so totally failed, that philosophers of the present
 day seera much inclined to regard the solution of the problem as
 an impossibility.     The writer of the present paper is fully aware
of this circumstance; ami, in offering to your notice a plan which
he has had the satisfaction to see attended with success, cannot
but express his wish that no position here advanced should be
received, unless it be evidently founded on the laws of mechanics,
or directly proved by experiment.
     The first object ought certainly to be the discovery of a
moving power sufficiently great to overcome the vast resistance
which a balloon experiences from the air.          Indeed, the failure of
all the experiments which have been made with oars, is evidently
to be attributed to the very trifling size of the machinery and
the smailness of the force employed on it.          In the preseht plan,
the ascending and descending forces, or in other words its levity
and gravity, .are alternately the moving powers.            It is evident
that these forces are sufficiently powerful.       It will, however pro
bably be urged that the ascending and descending forces always
act perpendicularly, and hence cannot be of any service in the
present inquiry.      That these forces always act perpendicularly
is readily granted, but it by no means follows that the motion
which they cause the balloon to assume should be in a perpen
dicular direction.     The direction of the motion is regulated by
another cause, viz. the form of the resisting surface ; and hence,
spherical balloons having their form perfectly uniform on all
sides must necessarily ascend perpendicularly.          Now the princi
ple of the present invention consists in applying a resisting sur
face in such a manner as to cause the ascending or descending
motion of the balloon to deviate by a considerable angle from
a perpendicular      direction.     This was attempted and accom-
-plished by a method which I now proceed to describe.
    A square plane ABCD (fig. 1, PI. VI.) is formed by extending
paper or linen on the cross constructed of the slight pieces of
wood AC and BD.           This plane is attached to the balloon by
 strings adjusted    so  that   the diagonal BD shall constantly lie
 parallel to  the  horizon, whilst the other diagonal AC may be
 placed at any angle whatever.         A small triangular sail E is also
     Vol. 46. No. 211. Nov. 1815.                X                applied

322                          On guiding BalloOnS
             which can be moved to either extremity of the diagonal
applied,
      Having completed this apparatus,. let the plane be placed so
 tnat the diagonal AC shall form with the vertical line AF an
 angle FAC, equal to 70°.            Before 1 rel»te the experiments,    I
 will attempt to asceitain the direction in which such a balloon
 plight be expected to move, assuming the proportions nsed in
 the first experiment, when the ratio of the surface of the attached
 plane to that of a circular plane of the same diameter as the
 balloon was 1*4 : 1.
 ,     The first object is to find the relative resistances of the bal*
 loon and plane, which may be effected thus : Supposing the re
  sistance of the balloon to be 1, the resistance of a circular plane
  of the same diameter, and moving in a direction at right angles*
  to its surface, would be 2. Again : The square plane attached to
  the balloon opposing 1 .4 times as much surface as such a circular
 plane, would have a resistance equal to 2' 8, if it were to lie in
   a horizontal position.      But the breadth of the column of aiF
   which it meets is evidently as the sine of the angle of incidence,
   as is also the force^with which it will strike that eolumn: hence
   the resistance, being in the compound ratio of the surface aiul
   the force, will be as the square of the sine of the angle of inci
   dence.     In the present case the angle of incidence being 70°,
   the resistance of the plane is expressed by 2-8 x sin (703),=s
   2*472, and the resistance of the balloon and plane united is
   equal to 1+2-472=3-472.             Now it is evident that the velocity
   of ascent or descent will be accelerated until the resistance be
   comes equal to the power or weight of the balloon, which may
 .be therefore expressed by 3-472 also.           This being ascertained,
   let the straight  line AB   (fig. 2  and 3) be drawn equal to 3-472,
   Which may represent the ascending power (fig. 2) or the weight
    (fig. 3) of the balloon : draw another indefinite straight line
   AG, making the angle BAC = 70°, which will mark the position;
   of the plane. Then, since the angle of reflection is always equal
    to the angle of incidence, and the angle at which the plane
    strikes the air is 70°, the angle of reflection would also be 7t>°-
    Therefore a straight line AD, equal to 2-472, and making the
    angle DAC equal to 70°, will represent the resistance of the air
    to the plane.    The balloon and plane being acted upon by the
    two forces   AB  and AD, will consequently describe the diagonal
   AE of the parallelogram ABED, varying from a perpendicular
    direction by the angle BAE, which is found by trigonometry to
    be 45° 12'.    From the figures it is also evident, that the balloon
    when descending would move in a direction (from A to E, fig. 2)
    directly contrary to that (from A to E, fig. 3) in which it would
    move when ascending.         The preceding rough calculation can
                                                                       not

                        through the Atmosphere.                     323
 Wot be deemed very accurate, on account of the uncertainty of
  the present theories of resistance, but will serve to give us a
  general idea of the effect likely to be produced.
     The first experiment was performed on April 18, 1814. The
 diameter of the balloon was 4-5 feet, and the plane was con
 structed in the form of an ellipse of which the diameters were
 4*5 and 6\36.       The plane being elliptical instead of square
could not possibly make any perceptible difference in the effect,
 which wholly depends on the surface.
     The balloon was inflated in a building of considerable height,
and there suffered to ascend. The experiment was attended
 with the utmost success: for the balloon, instead of ascending
                                                       '
 jJerpendicularly, actually moved at an angle of 45 till it reached
 the ceiling. The power of the balloon being soon exhausted, it
descended along the very track it had described whilst ascending,
 arid returned to the spot whence it had set out.        Here the re
sult presents a striking coincidence with the preceding calcula
tion.
     This experiment was afterwards frequently repeated with a
square plane instead of an elliptical one, as I found the former
shape better adapted for furling.         There was also added the
triangular -sail E (fig. 1) before mentioned, which, by increasing
the resistance on the side to which it may be moved, is calculated
to answer every purpose of a rudder.         The experiment was now
«qtiaHy successful,    the balloon  turning to one side or the other,
according to the position of the small sail.
     The same experiment was performed in the open air for the
first time, October 12, 1814- The balloon's diameter was 3*5
feet, and the length of the' side of the square plane 4*25 feet.
The triangular sail was fixed to one side, for the following rea
son : The' balloon rising in the open air is carried by the wind
at' the same time that it is acted upon by the attached plane,
ahfl'it wtrtlld, therefore, be difficult for an observer to determine
the effect produced by the apparatus.        The triangular sail serves
as'a'test for this purpose; since, if the great plane did not act,
ihe' former would feel no resistance, and no particular effect be
jirttduced On the balloon.       But if the great plane did act, the
small sail would constantly experience resistance, and have the
 effect of making the balloon ascend in a spiral direction.        The
Walloon with its appendages was launched, and after a few se
 conds began to describe the expected spiral, which it continued
.to do until lost in the clouds.
     On October 2, 1815, another experiment of the same nature
 was made with a balloon six feet diameter, having a square plane
 whose side was 7*5 feet, and a triangular rudder in proportion.
 The effect produced during the ascent was perfectly" similar to
                                 X2                                that

324                           On guiding Balloons
that mentioned in the last experiment.     With the aid of a good
telescope, I had also the additional satisfaction of being able to
observe the descent.    Soon after the balloon became in equiK-
brio, the spiral motion ceased ; but as soon as ever the balloon
began to fall, it was resumed, but in a contrary direction.      ,
   These experiments appear to me to prove in a satisfactory
manner the possibility of causing balloons to deviate by a very
considerable angle from a perpendicular ascent or descent. This
conclusion might be confirmed, if necessary, by analogy from
several other contrivances of art founded on the same principle ;
such as kites, ships sailing with a side wind, &c. but 1 consider
it would    be superfluous.
    As I have now described these experiments at full length, it
 will be but tight to mention an inconvenience with which this
 method of aerial navigation is attended.           Perhaps the reader
 may have anticipated the observation that, to make a balloon
 proceed to any considerable distance in a given direction, it is
 necessary it should ascend and descend alternately with great
 rapidity. In a Montgolfier balloon this may be easily accom
 plished by the mere increase or diminution of the fire, and, per
 haps, by the addition of a large valve. A hydrogen-gas balloon,
 on the contrary, could not sustain for any length of time the
 continual losses of gas and ballast necessary for such repeated
 ascents and descents.       Hence, until some means are discovered
 of ascending and descending in a hydrogen-gas balloon without
 loss of gas or of ballast, the present plan is applicable only to
 Montgolfier balloons.        These balloons are generally regarded
in England as extremely dangerous, although I am inclined to
think the idea arises chiefly from the circumstance that in this
country no person has ever yet ascended in one of them.
    The mode of using the plane will perhaps be better under
stood by supposing that we have a large Montgolfier balloon
furnished with the necessary apparatus, and that      it'
                                                      is     required to
direct it   to a particular spot.       Itwould be requisite that the
plane should be furled during the inflation, and the commence
ment of the ascent.        When the balloon has risen to a sufficient
height, the plane         unfurled, and set at an angle of 70° from
                         is
the perpendicular.        The triangular sail  is next to be expanded
and managed as       a rudder until    it
                                        brings  the  machine round to
such  a   position   that  the   elevated  end of  the oblique diagonal
points towards that part of the horizon to which       it   is  required
to direct the balloon.      The greatest possible power must then
be communicated to the machine, which wiil ascend describing
the diagonal    of a square; and consequently move one mile hori
zontally   for every mile of perpendicular        ascent.    After con
tinuing rapid
        a          ascent  as  long as convenient, the balloon must

                                             through the Atmosphere.                                         825
     be made to descend, at the same time adjusting the plane so
     that it shall slant in the contrary direction to what it did during
     the ascent.      The balloon will now descend along the diagonal
     of another square, and in the same plane as before. These al
     ternate ascents and descents are continued until the machine
     reaches the required spot.
         The rate of the travelling of such a balloon may be estimated
     by the application of the common lawsfor the resistance of the
     air.   On the supposition that the diameter of the balloon is 80
    feet, the inclosed air will have a power of 8377 lbs., two-thirds
    of which may be allowed for the weight of the balloon, appa
    ratus, men, &c.        The remaining 2792 lbs. would give the bal
    loon a velocity of 28 feet per. second, or 19 miles an hour, which
    would also be the horizontal velocity.            If this should not be
    sufficient for the object in view, it may be increased by using a
    balloon and apparatus, the velocity being :n the sub-duplicate
    ratio of the diameter*.                            If,
                                       however, the principle could be ap
    plied to a hydrogen-gas balloon, the diameter necessary to pro
    duce a velocity of 28 feet per second would be only 40 feet.
         It obvious that the absolute motion gained
              is                                                    this plant                 by
    will only be equal to the excess of the balloon's relative velocity
    in the air above the absolute velocity of the wind.              The most
    serious objection, therefore-, to all schemes which have for their
    object the direction of balloons,         this — that the velocity of the
                                                                      is
    wind      generallv so very great as to destroy in a considerable
              is
    degree the relative motion of the balloon.          This objection, how
    ever, derives its chief weight from an opinion entertained                                                by
    many persons, that          balloon always moves with the very same
                                             a
    velocity   as   the  wind.     This they attempt to prove            saying                         by
    that     balloon being
             a                 in perfect equilibrio with the surrounding
    air, becomes        effect a part of that fluid, and consequently moves
                               in

performed.        When there is a very strong wind blowing, let a
stone, a clod of earth, and a piece of paper, all having the same
form and equal surfaces, be dropped together from a small
height. It may then be observed, that in the same lime, the
paper will be carried to a considerable distance by the wind, the
clod of earth to a less distance, while the stone is scarcely moved
it   all.   This certainly tends to establish the fact, that a dimi-.
 nution of velocity does take place, which I am led by analogy ta
 believe is in the sub-duplicate ratio of the difference between
 the specific gravity of the body and that of the air.         Hence, as
 the plan I have described requires the balloon never to be in
 equilibrio, it may reasonably be expected to move with a velo-i
 city considerably less than the wind.
     I shall just observe, that the plane may with very slight alter-.
 at ions be made to serve as a parachute, which may be directed
 on the same principle as the balloon ; and from the experiments
  I have made with parachutes thu» formed, it appears to be
 greatly superior to that used by Mons. Garnerin, both as to se
 curity and uniformity of motion, being entirely free from oscilla-.
 tion.
     It   may perhaps appear unnecessary to some persons that             I
 have had recourse to an oblique plane, independent of the bal
 loon, instead of constructing the balloon itself of such a form,
 Sas to present to the air the required oblique surface.             I have
 lately tried several experiments with balloons of different shapes,
  and which have convinced me of the great difficulty in attaining
 the object by such a method.           But it would extend this paper
 to an excessive length, if I were to detail the various experiments,,
 feud explain the causes of their failure.

 Islington, Oct.   19, 1815.                         John Evans, Jun.
     P.S. — The     method of forming the gores of a balloon, which
 is given by Cavallo^ and after him in most of the Encyclopaedias,
 is so very tedious, that any abridgement of this essential process
 must be considered          an advantage.    A brief description of the
 construction which        I have employed for some time may, per
 haps, prove acceptable, on account of its great simplicity and ac
 curacy.      It is derived from the obvious property, that the breadth,
 of the gore in any particular part is proportional to the chord;.
 drawn through that part parallel to the equatorial diameter.
     By the usual methods find the middle breadth AB (fig. 4) and
 the length CD of the gore.           On AB as a diameter describe the
 required shape AEBF of the balloon.            Divide the curve line FAJ2
  and the straight line DC into the same number of equal parts,
  and through the points of division draw the straight lines gh, ik%
                                                                        GH

ik, and through the points I,A,G and K,B,H, draw by eye the
«urved lines CIAGD and CKBHD, which will be the shape of
fhfi required gore.      In the diagram I have divided FAE arid DC
into only four parts, for the sake of clearness: in practice, how
ever, it is necessary to make use of eighteen or twenty divisions.
This method is equally applicable to any shape which may be
adopted, an advantage of which no other construction is pos
sessed.

 The      various hypotheses which have been invented to account
 for the    phaenomena of the Leyden phial plainly evince that the
«ubject still remains in some obscurity,            Nor is this to be won?
dered at, when we reflect that the properties of the electrical
elements are so little understood, that philosophers are divided
in their opinions respecting them.             Franklin, ^Epinus, Robison,
and some others, have supposed that all electrical effects are
produced by one fluid only ; whilst Du Faye, Symmer, Cigna,.
Eeles, &e. maintain that there are two fluids, which exist to
gether in all bodies, that thev counteract each other when united,
^nd can be made evident to the senses, only by their separation.
     Men are too apt to adopt the opinions of others without strict
examination. But it is an axiom in philosopKy, which ought
always to be kept in mind, tnat; "no position should be assumed
as the basis of any reasoning whatever, except what has been
proved by incontestable facts.5'

be called the pendulum electrometer, described in a former paT
per*, that the mechanical forces of those elements which pro
duce a spark are equal, moving through each other; but the.
jspark so produced is not an element, but the effect of those in
 visible elements which are brought into action by the motion
pf the machine.         Bat no spark can he produced unless those
 elfinjients pass through some conducting medium.

     4. Two bodies electrified with the same element repel each

     application   of  these Properties
                               Ley den Phial.
     When    a Leyden phial is receiving a charge, a succession of
 sparks passes between the ball of the prime conductor and the
 ball upon the top of the phial ; whence it is evident,' ,frqm what
 has been previously stated, that when one of the elements (ther
 mogen for instance) is thrown into the phial from the prime
 conductor, the other element (photogen) is attracted out of the
 phial by the former element, and by passing through the air in
 opposite directions they generate combustion.            And as soon as the
 thermogen on the inside of the phial becomes sufficiently power
 ful to act through the two coatings and the glass contained be
 tween them, it repels the element of its own kind into the earth
 from the outside of the phial, and attracts the contrary element
 at the same time out of the earth ; and as they pass through
  each other, they generate a spark at the bottom of the phial.
     When all the photogen is drawn out of the phial, and an equal
 portion of thermogen is thrown in, the phial is fully charged ;
  for then the outside of the phial is deprived of all its thermogen,
  and its place supplied with an equal portion of the other ele-
.ment from the earth.
      This is the theory of Mr. Eeles, which appears to be well
  founded.     Some objections, however, have lately been advanced
  against it by Mr. Donovan*, which ought not to be passed
  over in silence ; for, if these objections cannot be answered by
  incontrovertible facts, the theory of electricity is still involved in
  obscurity ?
      Objection 1.    "If    the contrary powers are situate on each
  surface of the charged phial, and if they strongly attract each
  other through its substance, why do they not pass through it,"
  since it has been proved that glass is permeable to each kind of
  electricity?
      Answer. . This objection will vanish when it is understood
  that the coating prevents the two elements from passing through
  the glass and combining. This conclusion must be admitted as
  a just one, since an uncoated phial cannot be charged ; for these
  elements pass through glass as freely as light.            More light will
  pass  through   thin  glass  than   thick,   and   the  same  law seems to
   obtain in electricity.

    Objection 2.       It has been supposed that when one of the ele
ments is passing from the inside of the phial towards the con
ductor, and the other from the conductor into the phial, "these
two powers necessarily meet, and condense each other into the
form of (lame : they return to the natural state, and therefore do
not exert any sensible action."
    Answer.       It has been proved by the pendulum electrometer
that the two elements, after having passed through the card in
opposite directions, still have power to throw off the two pen
dulums in a. direction perpendicular to the card, so as to form an
 angle with each other of 70 degrees.            Consequently the two
 elements exert      a very sensible action on matter, after they have
generated combustion, and before the* return to their natural
 state.
    The 3d Objection is founded on the supposition that the two
 elements in the natural state have a strong attraction for each
 other.
    "If   the two electricities have so great an attraction, why did
 the power thrown in on one side overcome the attraction of the
 similar to the contrary power naturally co-existing on the other
 side ? Why should not the natural combination remain unaltered,
 when it was maintained by a force equal to that which endea
 voured to effect a separation of its component electricities?"
     Answer.       If the two elements of electricity have an attraction
 for each other in their natural state, it must be strongest where
 their quantities are greatest.       Now the earth is the great re
 pository   of these-  elements, from  whence all the electrical energy
 which   is  constantly acting   in every part of the ceconomy of na
 ture is derived : consequently, according to this hypothesis, the
jattraction of these elements for each other must be inconceivably
 greater in the earth than in small quantities of matter.
     How is it possible, then, that all the various compositions and
 decompositions in meteorology should take place, and that all
 the living functions of animals and vegetables should be carried
 on, if a strong attraction existed in the natural state of these
  two elements ?
     From a great number of experiments which I have made upon
 this subject, it evidently appears to be an invariable law of na
 ture, that the slightest excitement of an electric is sufficient to
 attract the contrary element out of the earth.
     The following experiment proves to a demonstration that the
 two elements of electricity, in their natural state, have no at
  traction for each other.

   JLXII. Statistical Account of the Quicksilver Mines of Idria in
       Jllyria. By M. Paysse, Superintendant of the Manvfat*
       ture of Mercurial Product ions.
                             [Concluded       from p. 313.]
        EGETation is neither so active nor so early at Idria as at
    Laybach, and even Upper Laybach. The months of August
    and September are those in which vegetables seem to shoot out
    most luxuriantly.
       A great number of rare and curious plants grow on the alps
    which surround Idria.          The celebrated Scopoli has described
    them very minutely, and very few have escaped him.                      Rye, bar-?
    }ey  and  maize,    succeed very   badly       around   Idria.
        The trees of which the forests are composed are various kinds
    of pines, yews, ash, &c.
        The leguminous plants are reared at great difficulty ; besides,
    they are not juicy.
        Fruits with kernels rarely ripen, and those gathered are taste
    less and watery.
        Apples and pears thrive a little better, and are fit to be eaten
    or used for cyder and perry.
        The vine, which shoots up here vigorously, furnishes a grape*
    which ripens but very rarely.
                               Medical Constitution.
        Considered     in a medical point of view, the climate of Idria is
    not insalubrious : those thick and frequent fogs, which are the
    sources of many morbific affections to those who reside in the
     marshy plains of Laybach, do not prevail here.
        The workmen are subject to certain fevers ; phthisis is frOr
.    quent: but the diseases which most generally prevail among the
     working class arise from a checked perspiration,                       }t .will be
                                                                                 easily

              the Quicksilver Mines     of Idria in Elyria.            931
easily conceived that this kind of affection is the more com
mon, as the workmen when they come out of the mine, the tem
perature of which is very high, perspire abundantly, and take
no precaution to avert the bad effects of the cold air, even du
ring winter : they walk for half an hour at the interval of meals,
&c. with the breast uncovered*.           Colds and catarrhs are there
fore very common during winter, but contagious diseases are ex
ceedingly rare.
     The disease which most affects the inhabitants of this coun
try, and which is also common in Carniola, is the tooth-ache ;
persons of both sexes are subject to it, and even the young.
Every person loses the teeth very early in this climate, and it is
rare to find a person with good teeth.          It is true that they are
all careless with respect to their teeth. Pedicular diseases aft
almost unknown among them, but scrophulous cases are very
 common.
     The common people of the lllyrian provinces, and even those
 around them, have imbibed a prejudice that it is sufficient to live
 in Idria to lose one's health: a thousand stories are told, to prove
 that the mercurial vapours there inhaled render the air injurious
 to health.
     This prejudice is unfounded: no atmosphere is more steady;
 its pressure is nearly always the same, and better health is
 there enjoyed than in the other part of the provinces.              I have
*een many 3ick persons from Laybaeh, both Frenchmen and
  natives, come to Idria, and there get well more promptly than
 they could anywhere else.        Among the French who resided there
 four years, and who were consequently incessantly exposed to
  the combined action of the air and mercurial substances, with
 which one would suppose it impregnated, not one ever ex
  perienced any of the symptoms supposed to result from inhaling
  this metal.     The nature of my duty compelled me to be con^
  tinually exposed to emanations from the preparations of this
  metal, and the metal itself ; and I never felt the slightest incon
  venience, nor the slightest tooth-ache, whilst the inhabitants
  were most severely affected by it.
     It is true, however, that the workmen who are employed in.
  the verv painful labours of sweeping the chambers of x-ondensa-
  tion of the mercury in the furnaces, are those who really expe,-
  rience all the deleterious effects of the metal while they are ex
  ecuting this operation.      In fact, these workmen, being for two
  hours in an atmosphere       of  mercury in the state of pulverulent
  pxide in extremely minute division, inspire a considerable quari-

  tity of it while they are detaching it from the sides of the con
  densers, into which they are obliged to go: thus they undergo
  a copious salivation ; and after working in this way several years
  in the furnaces,. shiverings come on, which do not permit them
  to stand erect any longer.       Several workmen are in this melan
  choly condition at Idria.
   .
       Much fewer goitres are met with in Idria than in the moun
  tainous countries of Carinthia and Styria.      Cretins are also very
  rare.
       The fair sex in  Idria, without being either beautiful or fresh-
  coloured as in other mountainous countries, nevertheless enjoy
  a robust and vigorous health.       The sedentary life of the women,
  who are occupied at Idria in making a common sort of lace ;
  the little care which they take of their persons ; the food which
   they eat, being always farinaceous, with lard, and cabbages
   soured by fermentation ; the extremely high temperatnre in
  which they live, the small windows of their apartments being
  but rarely opened ; — all these circumstances concur in taking
   away their colour, diminishing their vivacity, and giving their
   countenances at the same time a sickly hue.
       Many of the male children are affected with rickets.      Indeed,
  the boys seem in general to have a less robust      constitution  than
   the girls, with the exception of those whose parents are em
   ployed in the woods.       It may be easily conceived, that the son
  of a miner who is introduced to his father's work at the early
   age of twelve, exerts his bodily powers much more than the son
   of a wood-cutter, who does not handle the axe until he is of
  mature age.       The former, therefore, become old and decrepid
   much sooner than the latter, who of course breathe a purer
   air.
       The water drunk by the working classes at Idria is very pure,
   although it niters through limestone.        Chemical analysis ex
   hibits but trifling quantities of foreign matters held in solution.
   The sub-carbonates of lime and of magnesia are manifested by
   the reagents.
       It has been also remarked, that the good races of animals, and
   particularly those of horned cattle, do not prosper here : they
   are in fact always poor, and miserably fed.      The inhabitants of
-these countries ascribe this defect to the mercurial and sulphur
  ous vapours which escape from the furnaces while they are at
,
   work, which is not the case generally, but only once a week.
       This observation, which I am authorized to consider as very
   ill-founded, would deserve a particular examination in a separate
   work. . I shall content myself for the present with detailing, in
   a summary way, what has been taught me by an experience of
   four years in concert with some skilful physicians.       .
                                                               Influence

    Influence    of the  Vapours of the Furnaces on Animals and
                                Vegetables.
     AH the vapours whicli issue from the furnaces while they are
 at work, pursue, as I have already observed, the course of the
 torrent of the Idrixa, and proceed almost always to Lower Idria,
 or into the valley of the 'Canonila : it ought therefore to be in
 the places where these gases seem to be accumulated, that their
 influence should be exercised in all its fury on the animals there
reared ; but nothing of this kind seems to act upon them : there'
cannot be finer animals than are to be seen in the opposite di
stricts of Zala, Nicova, &c.' The general diseases are, in fact,
 much less frequent among the inhabitants of the Lower Idrixa
 and the Canomla than at Idria.
      Epiznoties, or cattle epidemies, are extremely rare in this vil
lage, while on the other side of the Alps, and at the distance of
three or four leagues, they exercise frequent ravages : hence it
appears natural to conclude, that if the finer kinds of animals do
not prosper in the district of Idria, this may be owing to other
 causes than to the deleterious influence of the vapours which are
 extricated from the minerals while they are in the furnaces.          I
am greatly inclined to think, that if cultivators gave themselves
the trouble to renew the species, and to rear them with more
care than they have generally done, they would soon meliorate
 the breed.                "
                           Situation  of the Mine.    ..
     It is at the lower end    of the valley or basin of that name, and
the town, as I have        already said, is built with the materials of
the subterranean excavation.
     This metallic stratum has heen recognised to be 400 toises
 (fathoms) or 800 metres in length, 500 toises or 1000 metres
 in breadth, and 120 toises or 240 metres in depth.
     There are six apertures or chief borings in this mine, four of
which are vertical.        Three of the latter are intended for the ex
traction of the ores, rubbish, or for pumping out the water.
 The fourth is solely used for conveying into the mine all that
is necessary for the wood or mason work, to make the interior
operations safe.        The names of those vertical wells are Saint
Barba, Saint Theresa, Saint Francis, and the Emperor Joseph.
     The machines for drawing off the water are common pumps;
fifteen cylinders are adapted to each other, with fifteen pistons
with suckers.        Every pump has its reservoir, which serves at
the same time for a feeder to the upper cylinder.         The hydraulic
wheel which sets these various pumps in motion is about 36 feet
 diameter.
     The machines for drawing up the ore, &c. are boxes of a
                                                                  paral

 $54                    Statistical Account   df
 parallelogram   form, well mounted with iron, capable of con
taining seven or eight hundred weight of ore : a hydraulic wheel
 with double power, which a workman stops or puts in motion
 when ordered, gives the impulse to a capstern on which a cable
 rolls and unrolls.    The water which moves those two wheels
 comes from a canal which takes its rise in the Idrixa, and which
 feeds two wells, as well as the workshops and washing-houses.
    The entrance of the mine by which the workmen descend, as
Vvell as the travellers from various parts of Europe to visit these
 immense caves, is inclosed within a building in the town, which
 abo contains the room in which the workmen are collected pre
 viously to going upon duty. It is in this room (named in German
gesehtube) that the workmen are called over and paid their
 wages, &c. by the controllers.
    There is also an inclined opening or stair- case of stone and
 <wood steps, by which persons may descend into the mine for 150
 yard's.   But in order to get lower there are wooden ladders
 placed, and some of these are riveted perpendicularly against
 the wall; which makes the descent very inconvenient          t.» those
 unaccustomed to such expeditions.
    Nine stages of galleries or horizontal borings (including inter
 mediate ones, with their numerous ramifications,) constitute the
 whole of these vast subterraneous works.      Most of these galleries
 are walled up with much art and skill, in- order to prevent the
Jailing in of the earth so frequent in these kinds of works. The
 arches and walls are very simple and oeconomical, and yet very
solid : they are of brick.
    The galleries are generally about seven feet high, and as
 many broad.      In general they are all well aired, currents being
 established between them and the main pits.          Some of them,
Jlowever, particularly  towards   the centre, are not  so well aired.
    The temperature is variable in the interior of the mine. In
 fact, it may be easily conceived that it ought to be higher in re
 gions where it is not possible to establish currents easily.    I have
made a great number of thermometrical observations ; and I re
 marked that in countries where there are great beds of rich ores,
or in their vicinity, the heat raised Reaumur's thermometer
 from 24° to 28° above zero.      1 have also observed the tempera
 ture at 24°, where the strata were blackish schists, very poor in
 mercury.
    Compelled to work in an atmosphere of which the heat is
very considerable, the air rarefied, and the atmosphere often
loaded with carbonic acid gas coming from the combustion of
the oil used by the workmen in their. lamps, .the health suffers,
 greatly.
    The working day at Idria consists of eight hours; but when
                                                               digging

digging In galleries, the temperature              of which is very high, ,the
  Workmen relieve each other every two hours; and yet they are
  in a continual state of perspiration, although they work almost
  naked.      This perspiration weakens them much.
      The workmen are prohibited from drinking spirituous liquors :
  Water is their only beverage, and it is brought them by boys
  Who are constantly going about the pits to supply them.                  This
  is wise regulation.
      a
      When the workmen are employed on a part of the mines which
  Contain native mercury, a small portion of this metal is mixed
  with the dust of the matrix, and is thus inhaled : petsons thu*
  employed for any length of time lose their teeth very soon*.
      The rocks of the mine are in general calcareous, and belong
  to the formation of the Julian alps.               This calcareous mass               is,
   however, rarely pure             :  composed of

   lie mines with regular seams.
       The miner has no certain guide for finding good ore in any
   particular direction: thus he must dig out every thing before
    him:    the work          therefore equally arduous in the galleries
                               is

    has done in some other parts of the globe where she has been
    pleased to conceal metallic treasures.

      Enormous heaps of shells are mixed with mercury, bitumen,
  and sulphur.       The ores are therein disseminated in the most un
  equal and most original manner, so that the indications which
 were favourable at one time are not met with again for a great
 length of time, and even never. What we discover one moment
  is lost the next, and almost always it is chance only which leads
 to rich beds : thus, when discoveries have been made, great care
  is taken to oeconomize them.
      In general the mercury obtained at Idria is combined with
 sulphur, bitumen, and iron.            The substances which serve for its
 matrix are often very complex, as will be seen on becoming ac
  quainted with the principal varieties of these ores.

     I could describe many more rocks, schists, &c. which are met
with in the mines of Idria ; but the above I presume will give a
correct idea of the substances with which the mercury is in ge
neral combined.
  . The interior of the mine is
                                       very dry, most of the borings are
shored up with wood or walled with stone.                     Where the solid
at  Idria; but tliis is not the case, for it is neither abundant nor rich: and
as  it is decomposed even in the interior of the works, it produces the silky
sulphates which are found in the galleries.       It is a kind of sulphurous hy
drate of mercury, and is put through the washers' hands before it can be
used.
                                                                            rock

               the Quicksilver Mines   of Idria in Illyfia,     339
  rock has been cut through, there is of course no occasion for
 these precautions.
     The workmen are classed according to their rates of pay.
 They are divided. into companies, and their classification with
  respect to the distribution of the corn which is furnished them,
 is in proportion to the number of children belonging to each
 family, and to the rank the workmen respectively hold.
     Every month the labours for the interior of the mine are re
 gulated.      With this view the chiefs of the establishment call a
 general meeting of all the workmen, who are bound to attend.
 A person called the Schickten Schreiber reads with an audible
  voice the arrangements which have been made for all the works.
  The workmen are formed into companies of four men for the
  galleries, and each designated by his name for the spot which
 is intended for him.
     The hours in which the labourers work are from four in
  the morning to noon, — from noon to eight in the evening, — and
  from eight in the evening to four o'clock in the morning : this
 gives each man eight hours labour daily.        The masons who are
 employed in building up the mine walls, as also some other per
  sons who are not exactly miners, work ten hours.
     At three o'clock every morning a bell rings to summon the
  workmen to the hall or geselstuleoi the mine, where their names
  are called over previous to descending.
     Every person then proceeds to the spot allotted to him, fur
  nished with a common oil lamp.        The masters and other sub
  altern officers also descend into -the mine to superintend the
  various gangs of miners.     At mid-day these sets of workmen are
  removed,    and again at eight o'clock in the evening.
      The chief director of the mines visits them on the 1st and
  loth of each month, accompanied by all the engineers, &c. of
  the establishment, when he inspects all the works and regulates
  the price of the ulterior labours. There are two ways of settling
  with the workmen ; either '
                                by the day or by the piece, but the
  latter way is preferred.    They are paid a certain sum for each
  c ubicfathom.
     The price of the cubic fathom of ore, or of cutting into the
  rock, is regulated by the hardness, the difficulty of working, the
  distance of the workman from the mouth of the pit, and the
  temperature of the region in which he works; and sometimes the
  deleterious effects of a particular spot are taken into the ac
  count.
      Besides   sweeping clean the gallery in which he works, the
» workman is also obliged to pick out the richest ores, to put them
  aside in a corner, and to mark them with a cross of wood, that
   they mav not be confounded with those which are poor.
                                 Y2                              The

 340                    Statistical Account of
     The ores when drawn up from the pits are conveyed by work
 men to the washing-rooms, where the richest are set apart. The
 middling sorts are picked also, and arranged according to their
 value.    Men and boys are employed in this business.
     The wirework or sieves which serve for washing the ores are
 of seven numbers, and each has its character of fineness ; for
 the ores are of various sizes, and contain a very great number
 of particles very rich in mercury.
     Afterwards an expert set of workmen put the same ores into
 other sieves : these are suspended over a cistern filled with
 water, into which the workmen immcrge them constantly, taking
 care to shake the sieve, in order that the heaviest molecules may
 fall to the bottom.    The lighter portions at the surface are de:
  canted, and great care is taken to collect those which appear
 red, as they contain cinnabar.
     The ores after thus passing through the various sieves are
 called kerns, No. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-
     The ores which have passed through the sieves, and which
 are separated and rejecter), are the coarsest.     They are placed
 under stampers to be reduced into powder, and afterwards un
 dergo with the rest a new concentration in washing-houses with
 tables forming inclined planes.
     There are two kinds of inclined tables: some are moveable,
 and the mineral dust which comes from them is called stosherd
 schliek: others are fixed, and what comes from them is known
 by the name of schliecks, No. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
     The regulations of the mines of Idria require that the ores iri
 powder, called srfiliecks, should never be less than 7 per cent, of
 mercury. When, after the analysis which the assayer makes every
 week, it is ascertained that these metals do not contain the re
 quisite quantity of metal, the workmen are not paid their wages,
 and they are obliged to recommence the labour of concentration
 gratuitously.
     In the washing-houses the ores in powder are weighed and
 put into the depot on Friday every week; from thence they are
 carried to the furnaces.
    Before, however, submitting the ores to the action of the fire
 they are previously analysed by the assayer, and the quantity
 which ought to compose a charge, both coarse and fine, is sub
jected by an officer appointed for the purpose to a rigorous ad
 measurement by weight ; so that the quantity of mercury to
 be expected from the operation may be ascertained beforehand
with tolerable precision.
    As the ores are of two kinds, in respect of -size, there are also
 two sets of furnaces for treating them.
    These furnaces are forty fathoms long by eight broad, in
                                                 "

    The first, which is destined to roast the ores in large pieces,
has in the first place a trapezion fire-place, surmounted by a
sort of open vault or chimney, which communicates with a kind
of furnace into which the charge of the ore is put. Care is taken
to supply this first vault with poor ores in large pieces, in order
afterwards to be able to charge it with all the fragments which
are richer.      This furnace once well filled, the second furnace,
which is superposed on the first, is charged ; its vault is also open
at top, and its hollow part is formed by the vault or chimney of
the latter.      Instead of charging this second vault with ores in
pieces of a certain size, it is charged with lumps of earth into
which small ores have been put called gr'iiben klein, or the va
rieties which we have called kernno.          This last furnace being
charged,    the   doors of all the chambers  are  luted.
   This first furnace has two fronts, i. e. two fire-places, and four
chambers, which communicate by lateral pipes with two rows of
reservoirs of mason work, or very high chambers separated by
intermediate walls, but communicating with each other by aper
tures of a square foot, placed alternately.            The number of
these reservoirs or condensers is twenty-eight.          The area is in
clined, in order to facilitate the flowing of the mercury into re
servoirs destined to receive it.       The last of these chambers of
condensation is surmounted by a second chamber above the first,
which is terminated by a chimney to give vent to the vapours
that cannot be condensed in this large apparatus.              A funnel
common to all the reservoirs facilitates the arrival of the mer
cury in another large reservoir in the apartment where the mer
cury is collected in order to pack it.
    The second furnace destined to burn all the ores in powder is
constructed on the same principles, with this difference only,
that there are six furnaces instead of four, and twenty-four
chambers of condensation instead of twenty-eight ; and the fur
naces are charged with lumps of earth filled with scldiecks, or
ore in powder.
    In the first-mentioned furnace only 300 quintals (cwt.) of ore
are burnt, and in the second the charge may be (300 quintals and
             -
upwards.
    The charge of the ores when once effected, all the apertures
both of the furnaces and of the chambers of condensation are
carefully luted with clay and slacked lime ; afterwards the whole
is heated for about nine hours with a progressive fire, until the
earthen clods are red hot, and the ores in pieces burn vehe
mentlv.      This time is generally sufficient.       The apparatus is
 then allowed to cool for six days, and the mercury is afterwards
 collected.     It would be difficult to obtain the metal sooner, a«
 the furnace retains its heat a long time.
                                   Y3                               One

342                        Statistical Account    of
    One operation of the furnace produces about 80 quintals of
mercury, more or less, according to the quality of the ores.
    The quicksilver, after being poured into the common reservoir,
is taken out and packed in sheepskins in portions of 100, 50,
and 25 pounds : they are tied with cords previously rubbed with
soap.     The skins are then conveyed to another department,
where each is inclosed within a second skin,
    But the Austrian government has not confined its attention to
the production of pure quicksilver alone: all the preparations
of mercury known in commerce are also made ;it Idria.
     Corrosive sublimate (muriate of mercury oxygenated to the
maximum) , mild sublimate (or submuriate of mercury at the mu
nimum), red precipitate, cinnabar or red sulphuret, vermilion
or washed mercurial sulphuret, &c. are also daily manufactured
at Idria.
     These articles are so well manufactured under the Austrian
regime, that nothing is left to desire.          Chinese vermilion, as it
is called, forms the only exception ; and even in this branch of
 the manufacture I conceive that in the four years of my super-
intendance I made several valuable improvements.
     The buildings destined for the preparation of mercurial pro
 ducts contain three very large laboratories.        The first is intended
 for the amalgamation of the mercury with the sulphur by means
 of casks which a hydraulic machine turns on its axis.                 The
 same wheel acts as a stamper for pulverizing the sulphur.
     The mixture of sulphur and mercury, when -once effected, is
 converted into cinnabar.         For this purpose furnaces are placed
 beside the apartment for the amalgamation ; they contain each
 six vessels, into which eighty pounds of matter may be intro
 duced.       Nine hours of a graduated and steady heat are suffi
 cient to    finish  one operation.
     The second laboratory is destined for the preparation of ver^
 inilion ; and for this purpose eight mills are arranged for the
 grinding of the cinnabar, as well as a certain number of large
 wooden tubs to wash the products. The washing being finished,
 the vermilion is dried in a stove which is warmed by the waste
 heat of the furnaces in which the cinnabar is sublimed.
     In the third laboratory there are twenty furnaces, each fur-
 uished with six large iron capsules.         In this laboratory are pre
 pared   all   the  mercurial  salts, the  red  oxides at the maximum,
  the sulphates     of mercury, the nitric acid, &c. &c.
     The accessory apparatus consists of stampers, a reverberating
  furnace for the calcination of such substances as require that
  operation      before they enter into saline compositions ; sieves
 for cleansing the ores, and casks fitted with measurements for
  ascertaining precisely" the matters which enter into the com
  pounds,                                                                In

             the Quicksiluer Miiies  of Idria in Illyria.            343
    In addition to the   above establishments     connected with the
preparations of mercury, there    are the  following:
   A  fine glass-work provides the bottles and window glass ne
cessary for the various establishments, besides exporting a con
siderable quantity.
   A pottery also supplies all the earthenware required.               A
tannery prepares the sheepskins for the packages : and a rope-
work furnishes the ropes for the machinery, and the smaller cords
for packing the quicksilver.
   There are also mechanists, engineers, blacksmiths, carpenters,
coopers, cartmakers, metal-founders, &c.
    The forests around Idria are under the management of an
inspector, sub-inspector, six guards, and three hundred wood
cutters.    From this source all the wood necessary for firing, and
the various uses of the mines, &c. is derived.
    The whole administration      of the mines is intrusted to a
council which is composed of the heads of the various departments.
The president of this council is the director in chief.        It meets
every Thursday,    and takes   cognisance   of all the   great interests
of the establishment.       Every Saturday there     is   a meeting of
the chiefs and sub-chiefs.      At this last meeting, every chief or
his deputy reads an account of what has been done during the
week, and states the wants of the ensuing week. The complaints
of the workmen, petitions from widows, &c. are also heard at
this meeting.
   The receipts and expenditure are under the direction of a
treasurer; but he cannot make any payment without the consent
of the chief director and council. The daily payments p.re made
out of a smaller treasury chest. There is also a board of ac
counts, which declares once a year the profits of the establish
ment.
    The receipts from the mines may vary considerably, as may
be easily supposed. \ For instance, if the richest ores only were
wrought and brought to the furnaces, it is evident that in two
or three years an immense quantity of quicksilver might be pro
duced ; but the poorer ores, which require much more trouble
and expense to make them productive, would remain, and se
veral unprofitable years would ensue, and the proper equilibrium
 of the establishment would be lost.
    The mines of Idria were managed by the French government
for the behoof of the order of the Golden Fleece (toison d'or) from
 the 1st of January 1810 to the month of September 1813.
    During these four years (wanting four months) there were
 sublimated in the furnaces 198, 176 quintals and 54 pounds of va-
                                  Y4                   .            rious

 rious ores, which produced 17,076 quintals and 54 pounds of
 quicksilver.    Hence the medium will be 8,616 of quicksilver for
 the quintal; which, at the regulated price of 130 Austrian florins
 per quintal, gives a sum of 2,219,945 florins, or 5,740,463
 francs.
    Of this quantity of metal there was actually delivered into the
 magazines the following quantities of quicksilver or of mercurial
preparations   : viz.
               14,194 quintals   25    pounds quicksilver

    All the expenses of the establishment        amount to 800,000
francs per annum ; and by balancing the receipts with the ex
penditure the average annual profits will be 713,409 francs.
    There are about 700 miners, 300 wood-cutters, and nearly
600 pensioners, including widows and children. The pensions
alone amount to 50,000 francs per annum.
    The payment of the workmen of every description is made
partly in kind and partly in money.       By reflecting for an instant
on this    mode    of paying the working classes, it will be seen
how wise the views were of those who founded the establishment.
This method unites the double advantage of attaching the work
men and keeping at all times the price of labour at a low price,
and always the same.
    The administration which furnishes them with corn, obtains
it at moderate prices in consequence of the great consumption ;
and as it is dealt out to the people employed, at a price which
has not varied since it has formed part of their wages, the work
men have had at no time any pretext for an increase of salary.
    This beneficent administration is extended to the children of
both sexes, and at the same price as to the workmen.        In the case
of the male infants, the distribution takes place until they are
fourteen, and the girls are served until they are twelve; because
at these respective ages both sexes can be admitted to various
occupations connected with the mines.         To those who from age
or infirmity are unable to work, the distribution of corn is coiir

 that the general conclusion of my readers will be — that the esta

 LXIII.     Some Experiments on a solid Compound of Iodine and
     Oxygen, and on its chemical Agencies. By Sir Humfhrt
    Davy, LL.D. F.R.S.*
 In    the two papers containing researches on iodine which the
 Royal Society has done me the honour of publishing in the
 Transactions, I have described a class of bodies consisting of
 iodine, oxygen, and different bases analogous to the hyper-oxy-
 muriates.      In the last of these papers 1 mentioned that I had
not been able to procure any binary combination of iodine and
 oxygen from these compounds, either by the method proposed
by M. Gay-Lussac, namely, the action of sulphuric acid on the
 oxyiode of barium, or by other methods of my own institu
tion ; and that in experiments on the effects of the acids on the
oxyiodes, new combinations only were formed.                 1 have lately
resumed this inquiry; and by pursuing anew and entirely different
plan of-operation, I have at last succeeded in combining oxygen
and iodine.      In the following pages I shall describe the circum
stances which led me to ascertain the existence of this compound,
and I shall detail some experiments on its analysis and its che
mical agencies.
    In the course of my researches, I observed, that when a             so
lution of the compound of iodine, and chlorine was poured into
alkaline solutions, or even into certain muriatic solutions, the
precipitate was an oxyiode ; and this fact seemed to indicate
that iodine had a stronger attraction for oxygen than chlorine ;
iodine, likewise, has an attraction for chlorine : it appeared,
therefore, extremely probable, that euchlorine, or the gaseous
combination of oxygen and chlorine, would be decomposed by
heat, and two compounds formed, one of oxygen and iodine, and
the other of iodine and chlorine, or that a triple compound would
be produced from which chlorine could be easily separated ; and
on submitting the idea to the test of experiment, I found that
I had not been deceived.
    To produce the compound of oxygen and iodine, it is neces
sary merely to bring the euchlorine and iodine together at the
          * From  the Philosophical Transactions  for 1815, part n.
                                                                   ordinary

346               Experiments on a solid Compound
ordinary temperature of the atmosphere.            As soon as the
chlorine comes in contact with the iodine, there is an immediate
action, its colour changes to bright orange, and a liquid is
formed.       When the euchlorine is in sufficient quantity, a white
substance likewise appears. By the application of a gentle heat,
the orange compound of chlorine and iodine may be made to
rise in vapour: and the compound of oxygen and iodine re
mains.
    When this compound is required to be dry, the euchlorine
should be passed through dry muriate of lime (calcane) before
it is admitted to the iodine. The apparatus that I have em
ployed for producing the substance is a curved bent tube, in the
form of an inverted L (q), closed at one end, the closed leg of
the tube being longest-, and which serves as a retort for genera
ting the gas ; a thin long- necked glass receiver for containing
the iodine, and a curved tube of smaller diameter than the first,
and cemented or ground into it for conveying the gas into the
receiver.      The muriate of lime is placed in some dry paper in
the upper part of the large curved tube ; and to produce the
substance from 40 grains of iodine, 100 grains of the hyperoxy-
muriate should be used, and four times the quantity of solution
of muriatic acid of specific gravity about 1*005 ; a very small
spirit lamp should be employed to generate the gas ; and to
prevent explosions, the heat should be applied with great care,
and only to the bottom of the tube.
    The compound of, oxygen and iodine when entirely freed by
heat from the compound of oxygen and chlorine, appears as a
white semi-transparent solid; it has no smell, but a strong
astringent sour taste.      Its specific gravity is considerable, for it
rapidly sinks in sulphuric acid.        When heated strongly, it de
composes, undergoing fusion at the moment, and is entirely
converted into gaseous matter and iodine, leaving no residuum
whatever.
    It requires for its entire decomposition a heat which is rather
below the boiling point of olive oil, and there seems to be little
 or no increase of temperature in the process.
     Its nature is proved both by analysis and synthesis ; for when
 euchlorine acts upon iodine, the volatile substance produced has
 all the characters of the body produced by the immediate action
 of chlorine on iodine ; and when the compound I am describing
 is decomposed in a pneumatic apparatus, the gas formed is found
 to be pure oxygen, and the solid sublimate produced is pure
 iodine.    .  .
     I endeavoured to determine the proportions of the elements
 in the compound, by decomposing it in glass tubes carefully
 weighed, and ascertaining the loss of weight of the tube, anil
                                                                   the

                       of Iodine        and Oxygen.                  347
the volume of oxygen evolved.     I have used very small quantities
of the substance ; but as my balance is delicate, I do not think
there can be any considerable error in the results.     I give those
which I consider as the most accurate.
    In one experiment, three grains of the substance afforded a
quantity of oxygen equal to 517'3 grain measures of water, and
lost in weight '6S. In a second experiment, two grains afforded
348*3 grain measures of oxygen.       In a third experiment, one
grain yielded 191 grain measures of oxygen.
    Many experiments that I have lately made, have convinced
me, that in my first paper I rated the number representing
the proportion in which iodine combines too low ; indeed at the
time, I stated that my results afforded rude approximations,
they demonstrated merely that iodine was represented by. a very
high number.     In an experiment recently made with care, fifty
grains of the iode of potassium decomposed by nitric acid, af-,
forded 32 8 grains of nitre.    According to this result, the numr
her representing the proportion in which iodine combines is
227'3 ; but I do not venture to state this number as exact, as
I  am not secure of the purity of the hydrate of potassa from
which the iode was made.
    The compound of iodine and oxygen is very soluble in water;
it slowly deliquesces in a moist atmosphere, but remains unal
tered when the air is dry ; its solution first reddens, and then
destroys vegetable blues, and reduces other vegetable colours to
a dull yellow.   When its aqueous solution is heated, as the water
rises in vapour, it gradually thickens, gains the consistence of a
syrup, becomes pasty, and at length by a stronger heat yields
the solid substance unaltered; unless a sufficient heat is applied
to decompose a portion of         it,
                                 when    gains

parently from some iodine set free. The pasty substance that
it forms is evidently an hydrate, for    yields moisture during its
                                            it
decomposition.
    Its action upon inflammable bodies       such as might be ex
                                                 is
pected from its composition.        When         heated, mixed with
                                                 it   is
charcoal, sulphur, resin, sugar, or the combustible metals in         a
finely divided state, detonations are produced        and its solution
                                                           ;

it acts both upon gold and platinum, but much more intensely
on the first of these ;nietals.
    When a    solution of
                        it   is poured into solutions of the alkalies
or alkaline earths, or when made to act on their carbonates,
oxyiodes or triple compounds of oxygen, iodine, and the metal
lic bases, are the results. By its action on solution of ammonia,
a  substance  is   produced apparently the same as that which         is
                                                               formed

    348             Experiments on a solid Compound
    formed by the action of the compound of iodine and chlorine,
    saturated with chlorine on the same solution, and which I have
    mentioned in a former paper, and which, consequently, must be
    regarded as an oxyiode of ammonia.
       When an aqueous solution of the compound is poured into a
    solution of the soluble salts of baryta and strontia, a copious
    precipitate of their respective oxyiodes is produced.        The oxy
    iode of barium, as I have mentioned in my last communication
    on iodine, is a compound very slightly soluble in water ; that of
    strontium is rather more soluble ; and those of calcium, mag
    nesium, glucinum, ittrium, aluminum, zirconum, are more so,
    and I believe in the order in which they have been named.
        It forms combinations with all the metallic oxides I have tried
    its agency upon, and precipitates lead and mercury from their
    nitrous solutions.
        The action of the compound upon acids is much more singular
    than that upon alkalies, earths, or metallic oxides.        It appears
    to form combinations with all the fluid or solid acids to which I
    have been able to expose        that
                                  it,        does not decompose.
                                            it                       When
    sulphuric acid  is  dropped into concentrated solution of
                                        a                        it  in hot
    water, a sojid substance   is   precipitated,  which   consists  of the
    acid and the compound     ;   for, on  evaporating  the  solution by a
    gentle heat, nothing rises but water.       On increasing the heat in
    an experiment of this kind, the solid substance formed, fused;
    and on cooling the mixture, rhomboidal crystals formed of a pale
    yellow colour, which were very fusible, and which did not change
    at the heat at which the compound of oxygen and iodine decom
    poses, but sublimed unaltered.       When urged   bya   much stronger
'
    heat,      partially sublimed, and partially decomposed, affording
              it
    oxygen, iodine, and sulphuric acid.
       With hydro-phosphoric acid, the compound presents phaeno
    mena precisely similar, and they form together         asolid, yellow,
    crystalline combination.
        It dissolves in solution of hydro-phosphorous       acid;   but on
    heating the combination, iodine         is
                                             immediately produced bv a.
    decomposition of part of the compound, and the remaining part
    unites to the phosphoric acid formed.
       When hydro-nitric acid     is poured into concentrated solution
                                                 a
    of  it, white crystals form in plates of a rhomboidal figure, and
„   which when dried partially decompose, arid partially sublime at
    a  much lower heat than the sulphuric or phosphoric compounds,
    and afford hydro-nitric acid, oxygen, and iodine.
        It dissolves in solution of oxalic acid; but by     a  very gentle
    heat, the oxygen of the compound acts on the inflammable bases
    of the acids, and iodine and carbonic acid are disengaged in
    great quantities.                                                   Bv

                           of Iodine and Oxygen.                     349
     By liquid muriatic acid the substance is immediately deconw
   pOsed, and the compound of chlorine and iodine is formed.
     When boracic acid was added to a solution of the new com
  pound, it dissolved in it by heat, and did not crystallize on cool
  ing.     By evaporation a solid white substance was procured,
  not so easily decomposed by heat as the compound itself.
     The taste of all these acid compounds is very sour, though in
  different degrees of intensitv: they redden vegetable blues, and
  they dissolve gold and platinum.         When they are made to act
  on the alkalies or earths, or on saline solutions which they are
  capable of decomposing, common neutral salts and oxyiodes are
  formed at the same time.
     The facts of the combination of the new compound with acids,
  serve to explain the phaenomena        of the action of these sub
  stances on the oxyiodes, which I have described in my last paper
 on iodine, and they confirm the opinions there stated on the na
  ture of this action.     The substance procured by M. Gay Lussac,
 by   the  action  of sulphuric acid on the solution of the oxyiode of
 barium,     and  which  he has supposed to be a pure combination of
 oxygen and iodine mixed with a little sulphuric acid, has evi
 dently for its base the combination just now described of sul
 phuric acid and the new compound, and, as I have shown, it
 likewise contains baryta.        However minute the quantity of sul
 phuric    acid  made  to act  on oxyiode of barium, a part of it is al
 ways employed to form the compound acid ; and the residual
 fluid contains both the compound acid, and a certain quantity
 of the original salt.
     That this compound acid is a true chemical combination, is
 evident from the observations already detailed, and from its cry
 stalline form.       There is every reason to believe that the pro
 portions of its elements are definite.       In one experiment I found,
 that a small quantity of the new compound in being converted
 into the rhomboidal crystals, gained rather less than half its ori
 ginal weight from the addition of the acid, i. e. two grains be
 came     2*8 grains.
     In  experiments in which the products of the decomposition
of the compounds from phosphoric and sulphuric acids were
collected, the acids disengaged were found in their state of hy
drates, from which it is probable that the crystalline compounds
are hydrates, and that the common acids carry their definite
proportion of water into the combination.            It is not indeed un
likely that the presence of water       is  connected   with the phaeno
menon of combination, and there is an instance of this kind
which I long ago pointed out. Sulphurous acid gas, and nitrous
acid gas, appear to have no action on each other, unless water
                                                                      . be

350                  Experiments on a solid Compound
be present ; but with the vapour of water they form a solid cry
stalline hydrate.
    Reasoning from analogy, it is probable that a compound of
oxygen may be formed, containing less oxygen tl»an the new
compound.      I have made many experiments with the hope of
discovering a body of this kind ; but without any decided suc
cess.    When the solution of the new compound is made to act
on the double compound of iodine and the alkaline metals,
iodine is produced which during its sublimation          yields no
gaseous product.     Iodine heated in a solution of the new com
pound slightly colours            it,
                            but this appears to be merely in con
sequence of its combining with the water       and the iodine rises
                                                               ;
in vapour with the water without decomposing the compound.
 In some experiments on the action of euchlorine on iodine,                     in
which the iodine was in great excess, the solid substance formed
had   a chocolate tint but this may possibly have depended upon
                              ;
a small quantity of free iodine, and when dissolved in water,                    it
 afforded     the evaporation of the water, the white compound
               by
only.
 I   detailed in my last paper on iodine, some unsuccessful at
tempts to procure       compound of oxygen and iodine from the
                              a
chlorionic acid, the substance produced                    by

bination of iodine and chlorine in water, on the idea that water
was decomposed in this experiment.             have made some further

  oxyiodes, I- venture to propose a name in conformity, that of
  oxyiodine for the new solid compound, and oxyiodic acid, for
  the acid compound it forms with water.          M. Gay Lussac, as I
  am informed, has proposed in a paper which I have not yet been
  so fortunate as to procure, but which is said to contain many
  new and important facts, the name of iodic acid for the com
  pound of oxygen and iodine, the existence of which he con
  ceived he had proved by his experiment on the action of sul
  phuric acid on the oxyiode of barium, and the terms iodats for
  the substances consisting of oxygen, iodine, and bases.          I am
  willing to pay every compliment to the sagacity of this ingenious
  chemist, in anticipating the knowledge of the nature of a body
  the separate existence of which he had not demonstrated by
  experiment ; but the term iodic acid does not appear to me
  sufficiently definite.    For the hydroionic acid, and the chlorionie
  acid, as well as the oxyiodic acid, may be all called as a class iodic
  acids, or acids from iodine, and the termination in at would
  place the oxyiodes in the common class of neutral salts, from
 which they differ in many respects. When they become binary
 compounds in consequence of their decomposition by heat, though;
 they lose all their oxygen, their neutral and saline character re
 mains unaltered, which is not the case with any other known
 class of bodies, except the hyper-oxymuriates ; and the terms
 iodes and oxyiodes which I proposed in the first paper, in which
 the distinction between these bodies was pointed out, sufficiently
 express the nature of the double and triple compound, and the;
 difference between them.
     I am desirous of marking the acid character of oxyiodine com
bined with water, without applying the name acid to the anhy
drous solid. It is not at all improbable that the action of the
hydrogen in the combined water is connected with the acid pro
perties of the compound ; for this acid may be regarded as a
triple. combination of iodine, hydrogen, and oxygen, an oxyiode
of hydrogen, and it is possible that the hydrogen may act the
same part in giving character, that fpotassium, sodium, or the
metallic bases perform in the oxyiodes ; and as hydrogen com
bined with iodine forms a very strong acid, and as this acid
would remain, supposing all the oxygen to be taken away from
the oxyiodic acid, it is a fair supposition that its elements must
have an influence in producing the acidity of the substance.

      tXlV.   Observations on    Dr. Thomson's Critique         on Mr.Sv.t-
        pings's new Method of Ship-building.               By Alexander
        Stuart, Esq.
                                To   Mr. Tillocli.
     Sir, —  I observe     in Dr. Thomson's Annals for last month,
     among the arialyses of books, an account of Mr. Seppings's me
     thod of constructing ships       As that gentleman has thought fit
     to erect himself into the situation of critic as well as analyst of
     the books described in his journal, it would be but rendering the
     public that justice to which they are entitled, if he would make
     himself acquainted with the sciences concerning which he has
     the assurance to speak, — if indeed he has either the capacity and
     acquirements of a philosopher, or the honesty of an editor.         His
    account of Mr. Seppings's construction is such a mixture of
    ignorance and blundering as would disgrace a common boat-
    builder : but it is of a piece with the confusion of his conceptions
    on the Trigonometrical Survey, on mathematical subjects in ge
    neral, and on geology, a science in which his total and ridiculous
    ignorance is only equalled by his ill-breeding and insolent dog
    matism.     In the review now under notice he talks of "substi
    tuting triangular or oblique beams for the parallel ribs which
    have hitherto constituted a ship's frame."
       To pass over the total want of correspondence between the
   terms here made equivalent, triangular and oblique ; who could
   comprehend from such a description, that Dr. Thomson's             " tri
   angular   or  oblique  beam"    was   a connected frame-work added
   to the ordinary rectangular framing of a ship, and so connected
   with it as to form diagonal ties or supports, similar in their ef
   fects to those which constitute the very existence of common
   carpentry? — a branch of mechanics of which this self-erected
  judge has probably never heard, or he could not have so de
  plorably blundered in the account he has attempted to give of
   this improvement.       But to proceed : He talks of " substituting
  the oblique for the parallel ribs, which adds prodigiously to
  the stiffness as well as the strength."           Really, a ship built of
s oblique triangular
                         beams  seems   very well  fitted for the voyage of
  such a critic to the land of Gotham, since to his other acquire
  ments he probably has not added that of witchcraft — the power
  of keeping himself afloat in a sieve.       If Dr. Thomson's conceit
 and insolence would permit his ignorance to derive any benefit
  from our friendly advice, we would tell him that Mr. Seppings's
 very ingenious improvement consisted in substituting a series of
  diagonal trusses in lieu of those parallel to the framing called
  riders, and that the ship's ceiling was omitted as superfluous ;
                                                                     while

   duel! on, as he could not comprehend them.            He goes on to say
, that the " decks are not loose as in the old system." Now, really,

  the Baltic in a ship, for the purpose of giving oolour to a quarto
  volume which might as well have been written in Grub-street,
  we cannot help either suspecting his capacity for observation,
  or doubting his assertion respecting the voyage, as the Leith
  traders (of which I have built two or three) are not in the
  slovenly practice of carrying their decks about them " loose."
      But I have dwelt longer on his review than it merits, and shall
  conclude by advising him to pursue a Pythagorean system —
  Seven years of silence and seclusion to his chamber, with a diet
  of oatmeal, may perhaps increase his knowledge, and neutralize
  his superacetic disposition.

  LXV.     On a new Species of coloured Fringes produced by the
      Reflection of Light between two Plates of parallel Glass of
     equal Thickness.          By David Brewster, LL.D. F.R.S.
      Edin.   & F.A.S. E*
  D cring      a series of experiments in which I was lately engaged,
  for the purpose of determining the law of the polarization of
  light, by successive reflections from plates of parallel glass, I
  observed that all the images of the luminous body which were
  formed by more than one reflection, were crossed by parallel
  fringes of coloured light, when the two plates had a small in
  clination to each other ; and that these fringes suffered consi
  derable changes, by varying the position of the plate with regard
  to the incident ray.
      These coloured fringes seemed at first to have the same origin
  as those of thick plates, which were discovered by Newton, and
  afterwards examined by the Duke de Chaulnes, Mr. Brougham,
  and Mr. Jordan ; and I considered the second plate of glass as
  performing the part of the quicksilver in Newton's glass mirror,
  or of the metallic speculum in the experiments of the Duke de
   Chaulnes and Mr. Brougham.             A more attentive examination,
  however, convinced me that this was a mistake, and that the
   coloured fringes constituted a new class of phaenomena, having

354              On   a new Species  of coloured Fringes
a different origin from those of thick plates, though explicable?
by the beautiful theory of fits of easy reflection and transmission
by which Newton was enabled to explain all the phaenoruena of
the colours of thick and thin plates.
     In order to observe the phaenomenon to the greatest advan
tage, let the light of a circular image subtending an angle of
 1° or 2° be incident perpendicularly, or nearly so, upon two?
 plates of parallel glass plaeed at the distance of one-tenth of
 an inch, and let one of the plates be gently inclined to the other,
 till one or more of the reflected images be distinctl)' separated
 from the bright image formed by transmitted light, and received
 upon the eye placed behind the plates-.           Under these circum
 stances the reflected image will be crossed with about fifteen or
 sixteen beautiful parallel fringes : the three central fringes consist
 of blackish and whitish stripes, and the exterior ones of brilliant
 stripes of red and green light ; and the central fringes have the-
 same appearance in relation to the external fringes, as the in
 ternal have to the external rings, formed either by thin plates,
 or by the action of topaz upon polarized light. If the two plates-
 of glass are turned round in a plane at right angles to the inci
 dent ray, the reflected images will move round the bright image,.
 and the parallel fringes will always preserve a direction at right
 angles to a line joining the centres of the bright and reflected
 images.      Hence it follows, that the direction of the fringes is
 always parallel to the common section of the four reflecting
 surfaces, which exercise an astion upon the incident light.
     The position of the plates remaining as before, let the incli
 nation of the plates^ or, what is the same thing, the distance of
 the bright and the reflected image, be varied by a gentle motion-
 of one of the plates, the coloured fringes wilt be found to in
 crease in breadth as the inclination of the plates is diminished,,
 and to diminish as the inclination of the plates is increased.
     In order to determine the law according to which the mag
 nitude of the fringes varies, I employed two plates of parallel glass
 -p^idths of an inch thick, and obtained the following measures-
 for the fringes which crossed the image that had suffered two-
 reflections between the plates.        The pencil of light was incident
 nearly   in  a vertical  direction upon the first plate.

                          the plates,       could not with any degree of

                                       is
 that the plane of incidence             at right angles to the common

 images.     But     the plane of incidence

 section     the plates, the reflected images increase in brightness
            of
with the obliquity of incidence, and the coloured fringes become
more vivid.      When the angle of incidence increases from 0° to
90°, the images that have suffered the greatest number of re

of the greatest service ih giving distinctness to all the phaeno
mena,    I  observed fringes across the first image, far surpassing
in precision of outline, and in richness of colouring, every ana
logous phaenomenon which had seen.     I          When these fringes were
concealed,     Ialso observed other fringes on the image immediately
behind them, and formed                third reflection, from the interior
                                        by   a

                            I
the fringes were extremely bright, and very faint stripes were
seen upon the one immediately behind it.
    On examining these phaenomena               little more attentively,

with the distance of the eye from the plates, while those on the
second and fourth image diminished with that distance.

    When the fringes on the second image were inclined to the1
right, those on the first image were inclined to the left; so that,
both in point of position and magnitude, the two sets of fringes
follow a different law.
    The preceding measures of the magnitude of the fringes at
different obliquities, were not taken with that accuracy which is
necessary for determining the law of their variation.                   I have
made numerous experiments for this purpose ; but when the
angle of incidence is considerable, there is always such a degree
ot distortion in the fringes, and such a perceptible variation in
 their magnitude, from the slightest change in the position of the
 eye, that I found it quite impracticable             to take measures in
which any confidence could be placed.               This difficulty no doubt
 arises from the imperfect flatness of the surfaces of the plates
 of glass ; and I fear that even our best artists are not capable of
producing better plates than those which I used in the preceding
experiments.      The following measures may be considered as to
lerably correct.

    If the two parallel plates are placed at any distance whatever,
 and the preceding experiments repeated, the fringes will be
 found to suffer no change either in their magnitude or direc
 tion.
    1 now took three plates of parallel           glass, that gave the co
 loured fringes when any two of them were put into the proper
 position.    When the third plate was placed either before the
 other two, or between them, or behind them, it did not in the
 least degree affect the fringes which they produced.                When it
 vvas placed, however, in such a position            as to form a new re
 flected image, this image was also crossed by the coloured
fringes.
    Vv'he the third piece of parallel glass was cemented with
 Canada balsam upon the face of the Jirst plate, or upon the back
 of the second plate, the fringes disappeared.             When the inter
 val between the two plates was filled with water, or witli Ca
 nada balsam, the fringes were very faint, though distinctly per
 ceptible.     Hence it follows, that the production
                                                               of the fringes

        produced  ly two Plates    of Glass of equal Thickness.     357
 depends upon the action of all the four surfaces of the two
plates of parallel glass.
    All the preceding experiments were made with plates which
 were cut out of the same piece of glass, and had therefore the
 same thickness.       I now tried plates of different thicknesses,
both when ground parallel, and when cut from common plate
 glass ; but I could never render the coloured fringes visible, un
 less when the glass was parallel, and exactly of the same thick
ness in both plates.      I also tried plates of topaz, of equal thick
nesses, and plates of sulphate of lime ; but though I used pieces
 of various thicknesses, I have never succeeded in making them
 exhibit the coloured fringes, owing, perhaps, to the imperfect
 flatness of their surfaces.
  - In order to ascertain if the
                                    magnitude of the fringes depended
 on the thickness of the glass plates, I procured a piece of parallel
 crown glass V^ydths of an inch thick, and compared the fringes
which it produced, at an inclination of 2J 20', and at a vertical
 incidence, with those produced by another piece of glass -'^'-j-dths
 of an inch thick. In the first case, the circular image was
 crossed by five fringes, and in the second case with seven
fringes: but          121       168      r _       ,

     In. another experiment, I found, from a mean of five measure

 the plates was 1° 58'.      Now the other pair of plates gave fringes
 13' 3" broad, at an inclination of 2" 20", which gives 15' 29"
for their breadth at an angle of 1° 58', and

Hence the magnitudes of the fringes are inversely as the thick
nesses of the plates which produce them, at a given inclination ;
and in general the magnitudes of the fringes are in the com-^
pound inverse ratio of the thickness of the plates, and of their
 angle of inclination.
     Hitherto we have supposed the glass plates to be placed be
tween the eye and the luminous object, so that only the 2d, 4th,
and 6th reflected images were seen.            When the eye is placed
between the plates and the luminous object, so as to perceive
the 1st, 3d, and 5th reflected images, the coloured fringes are
also    seen, having the same characters as those already noticed.
     Tiie phaenomena which have been described are equally pro
duced when the fringes are formed by polarized light, and they
do not suffer the least change when examined by doubly re
fracting or doubly polarizing crystals.

    When the eye is placed at a considerable distance, either be
fore or behind the glass plates, all the fringes have a very dis
torted appearance, arising probably from the imperfect figure of
the reflecting surfaces.

        produced   ly two Plates    of Glass of equal Thickness.    359
  RS does m>t pass through the first plate AB. In this case, the
fringes are produced in the same manner as if the ray had passed
  through AB.
     In fig. 3, the rays reflected from the plate AD do not pass
 'through the second plate CD.          In this case, the fringes are
 produced as formerly.
     In fig. 4. the reflection from the external surface mn of the
 plate AB is destroyed by a layer of indurated Canada balsam.
  In this case no fringes are produced.
     In fig. 5. the refraction and reflection at the interior surface
 op of the plate AB are destroyed by a layer of Canada balsam.
 In this case no fringes are produced.
     In fig. 6. the refraction of the interior surface of the plate CD
 is destroyed by a layer of Canada balsam, and in this case no
fringes are produced.
     In fig. 7. the reflection from the external surfaces mn, op, of
the two plates is destroyed, and no fringes are produced.
     In all these cases, the fringes are obviously produced by a re
 fraction and a reflection in each of the two plates, and the in
 terfering fringes are produced by the secondary reflections within
 the glass plates.
     The fringes, however, which appear upon the first or bright
images, are produced in a different manner from those formed
i>y the light that has been reflected from the plate CD ; for the
light of which they are composed has suffered two or more re
flections within the plate AB, as shown in fig. 8. and two re
fractions by the plate CD.        These refractions are absolutely ne
cessary to the production of the fringes ; for they disappear
when the light reaches the eve, without passing through the se
cond plate. Any variation in the distance of the plates, when
their inclination and thickness remain the same, ought obviously
to produce no change in the appearance of the fringes, as the
fits will return hi the same manner as before.
     In order to compare the preceding phaenomena with the New
tonian Theory of Fits, I propose to resume the investigation
with plates of parallel glass, that differ very considerably in
thickness, and that have their surfaces ground as flat and po
 lished as highly as possible ; and I have no doubt but that all
the results may be calculated by means of that beautiful theory.
    The fundamental experiment by which I ascertained the pro
duction of coloured fringes by two plates of glass of equal thick
 ness, has been repeated and verified by my friend M. Biot of the
 Institute of France, and was exhibited at a public meeting of
that distinguished body.

LXVI,      Observations and Experiments on the new Species of
    coloured Fringes discovered by Dr. Brewster, in the Light
    reflected between two Plates of parallel Glass of equalThich-
    ness.     By M. Biot, Member of the National Institute, &c.
The      discovery of a new species of coloured fringes by M. Brewster
being extremely remarkable, I was anxious to verify it by ex?
periment.        For this purpose, I first made use of two plates of
glass cut from the sides of a plane mirror with parallel surfaces
which had been ground and polished by M. Cauchoix.                         Each
of these plates had a thickness of about three millimetres (a lit
tle more than 1 -8th of an inch).             I then placed them one upon
another, keeping        them   separate,    at   their extremities, by small
pieces of card of the same thickness, which I could multiply at
pleasure when I wished to increase the distance or the inclina
tion of the plates.        In this way I obtained the coloured fringes
which M. Brewster has announced.                  I obtained them even when
the distance of the plates was at least two millimetres (nearly
1 - 1 3th of an English' inch):         but it ought to be remarked, that
the experiment is very delicate when the thickness of the glasses
is great, and their distance considerable ; for it is then very easy
to go beyond the limits of inclination within which the phaeno
menon is produced. The fringes were more easily obtained with
thin plates of glass about half a millimetre in thickness (l-50th
of an inch).       It then appeared to me, that at a given distance
the phaenomenon began to be produced by these plates when the
incident ray formed a much more. considerable angle with their
surface.      It appeared also, that in proportion to the thinness
of the plates the parallelism of their surfaces was no longer a
condition rigorously necessary ; for those which I used had not
been wrought for this purpose, and were a little prismatic.                     It
is, besides, easy to convince oneself that the light which produces
the fringes has been reflected several times from one plate to
the other; which explains why the fringes cease to be produced
when one of the exterior surfaces is wetted, as M. Brewster has
remarked.
     These fine experiments have obviously a great connexion
with those which Newton has described at the end of his Optics,
relatively to the coloured rings formed with thick plates of glass
whose two surfaces were spherical and nearly concentric.                       In
the experiments of Newton the incident ray falls at first perpen
dicularly upon the plate, and traverses it once.                   A great part

length of their fits changes both from the different extent of
their paths, and from the obliquity of their directions to the re
flecting surfaces.      Hence       follows that, in returning to the first
                                   it
surface of the mirror,         some      of these particles are in fits of
transmission, and others in fits of reflection. Knowing therefore
the length of their primitive paths, and also that which they.
describe in their return, and the ratio in which the fits of the
particles are enveloped             by
                                     obliquity,        easy to calculate in
                                                        it   is
what points each colour ought to emerge, and in what points
 the other colours ought to be reflected anew.            By following the
light emerging into the air according to the ordinary law of
refraction, one can calculate the diameter of the rings which ought
 to be formed upon       awhite surface at any distance from the mir
 ror. This     is  what Newton has done, for piates which had a
thickness of nearly      aquarter of an inch and tiie lesults were ex
                                                        ;
 actly conformable to the calculations even when the particles in
 first traversing the plate had suffered more than 34386' fits.
     In the experiments of M. Brewster, however, the equal thick
 ness of the two plates and the small inclination of their surfaces
 appear to me to act the part of the equal curvature of the two
 reflecting surfaces     inNewton's experiments, the inclination of
 the plates having      the  same influence as the sphericity in chan
 ging the length of their paths.              It
                                             therefore appears to me pro

                                                                       by
 mulae, and I    propose in     ashort time to verify this supposition.

  the manner in which the coloured rings are produced.

  362                Dr. Gilly in Reply       to Mr.  Farey
  in my last paper could not fail to excite the irritability of so
  pugnacious a polemic as Mr. Farey, and in that case I resolved to
  forbear from any reply; and, to use a childish phrase, to allow
  him the last blow.      But upon reading this reply, I find it so full
  of misrepresentation, and to contain so many perversions of my
  meaning, that 1 cannot forbear noticing them.
      First, then, I have not made any use in my last paper of Pro
  fessor Jameson's name, in order to appropriate to myself the dis
  covery of the unconformable position of the red ground, as Mr.
  F. has falsely asserted top of p. 279. — My words are, " But any
  thing 1 can say will be of far less consequence than the opinion
  of Professor Jameson, who allows me to state, that as far as he
  can judge from the description I have given, and the specimens
   1 have shown him, he considers the red sandstone and mountain
  limestone as members of the first flcetz formation."
       I do not unhandsomely charge Mr. Farey with wishing to in
   troduce confusion as to the geology of England ; for I say no
  thing more than is warrantable from the flagrant geological
   errors which Mr. F. has committed.            One of the most prepos
   terous is that of referring the sienite of Leicestershire to that
   omnigenous formation, the red ground, — contrary, I venture to
   *ay, to the opinion of every sensible geologist in Britain ; and
   contrary to the facts so beautifully displayed by the stratification
   on the western side of the Malvern range.           This range, I need
   not repeat, .consists in great measure of a sienite, which even
    Mr. Farey, as he wishes to imbed it in the red ground, cannot
   but allow to have been formed at the same time with the sienite
   of Leicestershire.     The fact to which I allude I have men-
.  tioned p. 186 and 1S8 of my paper, but I beg leave once more
   to press them upon Mr. Farey's notice.           Upon the west side of
   the range there rests a formation of limestone, which Dr. Pri-
   chard in the Annals of Philosophy assures us is seen dipping
   under the red sandstone of Herefordshire. This red sandstone,
    as I have myself ascertained in company with Dr. Prichard, lies
   below the mountain limestone ; so that we have these rocks
    formed, besides a world of coal beds and coal measures, before the
    red ground, which is supposed to be a twin production with the
   sienite, was deposited.     AH these facts, however, will, I dare say,
   be of little avail in altering Mr. Farey's opinion ; and I unfor
    tunate
                     " Non profecturis littora bobus aro."
        Another of these extravagancies, by which Mr. Farey outrages
    every thing like system, is to be found at p. 280 of his Report,
    where he gives it as his opinion, without the shadow of a proof
    in support of that opinion, " that the 4tk limestone of Derby
    shire is the lowest which is any where seen in England^ not ex
                                                                   cepting

               on the Stratification   of Great Britain.             363
Cepting the rocks of Devonshire and Cornwall, which probably
(says he) will appear to rank with the red marl in the British'
series; and so, perhaps, will those of the great part of Wales."
     This is Mr.Farey's English Geology: and it is quite of a piece
with his English Mineralogy ; for, upon finding some rock rest
ing upon the sienite of Leicestershire, he with the utmost sim
                                 "
plicity tells us that he had rather call it coarse slate, than risk
 any of the German names greenstone, hornstone, schistus, trap
formation," — substances as different from one another, and from
coarse slate, which I suppose should be read clay slate, as can
 well be imagined, and which it is hard to conceive how one who
pretends to be a mineralogist, and who even styles himself a
 mineral surveyor, should not know how to distinguish.             After
 having thus strangely perverted the order of succession as de
 termined by the united labours of the ablest men in every coun
 try, will it be believed that Mr. Farey should think himself of
 sufficient authority to venture to assure us, that it is a vain at
 tempt to reconcile the facts of British stratification to the Wer-
 nerian system ?        This however is the ipse dixit of our English
 Werner, and it becomes us to bow in humble submission to this
 oracle of geological knowledge.
      I have not anywhere said that Mr. Jameson considers the
  limestone of Derbyshire to be flcetz, and nothing but a deter
  mination to misrepresent my meaning could have induced Mr.
  Farey so far to misquote me: — for, after mentioning Professor
  Jameson's opinion that the mountain limestone, and the old red
                                            is it,
  sandstone usually associated with           belong to the first fluetz
  formation; I      immediately add,   u
                                       it       point yet to be ascer
                                                 a
  tained, whether the limestone associated with the coal-field of
  Derbyshire   is  to be considered as belonging to the flcetz or trans
   ition series" — thereby implying that Mr. Jameson's opinion does
  not extend to the limestone of Derbyshire, which         is altogether
  different in its geological relations from the limestone associated
  with the coal-fields in other parts of England.
       But of all the misrepresentations which Mr. F. has made, the
   most vexatious   is  that where he says that    seem to have taken
                                                     1
 it   for granted that the old red sandstone occurs universally be
   tween the Derbyshire-peak        limestone and the coarse slate.      I
   have   nowhere    mentioned   during the course of my paper either
   of these rocks, and hardly know what they mean. But               Mr.
                                                                    if
   F. means    by  the Derbyshire-peak limestone the 4th limestone       ;
I     have been so far from having taken       for granted that the red
                                               it
    sandstoneis   found under this rock, that in a separate paragraph
I     have mentioned the absence of the red sandstone as one of              -
    the circumstances which distinguish the Derbyshire limestone
 from the mountain limestone       in other parts of England.         This
                                                                paragraph,

paragraph, p. 185, Mr. F. has read and quoted from it : and al
though I wrote it for the express purpose of stating that the
stratification of Derbyshire forms a striking exception to every
thing I had been saying respecting the mountain limestone in
other parts of England; yet Mr. Farey has several times in the
most unhandsome manner applied to the limestone of Derby
shire, tuhat     I had said of the mountain limestone so commonly
associated with the red sandstone.            But the strangest thing of
all is, that after Mr. F. had understood me in the way above
mentioned, he should cite the passage where I had asserted the
absence of the red sandstone, and upbraid me for having spoken-
in too unqualified a manner on the subject, as the under strata of
the 4th limestone are still unknown, so that the red sandstone
may still be found under the limestone.
   After having quoted authorities to show that a red sandstone
occurs under the mountain limestone in Somersetshire, Glou
cestershire,       Herefordshire,   Monmouthshire, Brecknockshire,
Shropshire, in the north of England, and in Anglesea (as Mr.
Farey now mentions), are not these facts sufficient to show that
it is not merely an accidental association, but that it will be
found still more general, particularly if it be true that the red
sandstone commonly occupies the low part of the country?
   I have not charged Mr. Farey (towards the bottom of p. 1 87)
with the inaccuracy and confusion of not knowing the relative
age and situation of the red marl to be more recent or above
the coal-measures, as he has most falsely asserted.           The latter
part of the sentence,
                            " that not only members of the floetz but
even of the transition series have been referred to this forma
tion," is plainly the inaccuracy with. which in part only I have
charged     Mr. Farey.
    I have   little doubt that this letter will be followed by another
reply from Mr. Farey: but as I have sufficiently attained my pur
pose by correcting the mis-statements which Mr. Farey has made,
and as I can employ my time much more to my inclination than
by carrying on a controversy of this nature, I beg leave to say
that I shall on no account take any further part in it.
                   I am, sir,

     the sulphuretted chyazic yields; and to that of their Salts;
     together with the Application of the Atomic Theory to the
     Analyses of those Bodies.        By Robert Porrett, jun. Esq.
      Communicated    by   W. H. Woi.laston, M.D. Sec. R.S.*
The       Royal Society did me the honour of printing in the         volume
of their Transactions for last year, a paper of mine on             the na
ture of the salts termed triple prussiates, and on acids             formed
by the union of certain bodies with the elements of the              prussic
 acid.
      In that paper I endeavoured to prove that the elements of
 the prussic acid would combine with a certain .proportion of
 black oxide of iron, and form a peculiar and hitherto unknown
 acid, for which I proposed the name of the ferruretted chyazic
 acid. I showed that this was the real acid portion of the salts which
 had received the erroneous appellation of triple prussiates, and
 that the property of combining with the prussic acid, so as to
 change its nature, and increase its acid properties, was not con
 fined to the black oxide of iron, but was possessed probably by
 many other bodies, but certainly by sulphur, which formed with
 it another acid, for which 1 proposed the name of the sulphu
 retted chyazic acid.       The paper also contained some analytical
  researches into the proportions in which the elements of these
  new acids are combined in them, and also into the proportions
  in which they unite with different saline bases.
       My object in this paper is to add to the analyses contained in
  the former, two analyses which I have since made; and then to
  apply to the whole the admirable theory of Dalton, by which the
  proportions in which bodies can combine are conceived to be
  governed by the relative weights of their chemical atoms, and
  also Berzelius's addition to this theory, by which the combina
   tions of oxides with one another are conceived to take place
 -in such a manner, that the oxygen contained in one of these
   bodies is either equal to or is a multiple by a whole number of
   the oxygen contained in the others.
       I begin with describing the two analyses to which I have just
. alluded.
                   Analysis of Prussiate of Mercury.
       A. Fifty grains of this salt finely pulverized were kept at the
   temperature of 212° for six hours, at the end of which time
   they weighed exactly the same as before.

    B. Forty grains of this salt were dissolved in water and
composed by hydro-sulphuret of potash: the products of this
decomposition were prussiate of potash and black sulphuret of
mercury; the quantity of the former could not be ascertained
with accuracy, owing to the escape of much of the prussic acid,
but that of the sulphuret amounted to 37'2 grains.
    C. Disappointed in my attempt to estimate the quantity of
prussic acid by the last experiment, owing to its very volatile
nature, I' availed myself of the property I had discovered in the
hydroguretted sulphurets, of converting the prussic acid at the
 moment they detach it from prussiate of mercury, into sulphu
 retted chyazic acid ; which being much less volatile, and having
 a stronger attraction   for alkaline bases than the prussic, could
not escape from the liquid, and would give me the quantity of
 prussic acid it represented, by deducting from its weight jhat
 of the sulphur which I knew to exist in it. I therefore dissolved
ten grains of prussiate of mercury in hot water, and poured hy
droguretted sulphuret of soda into the solution until it no longer
 occasioned a black precipitate.     This black precipitate when
dry weighed 9*3 grains : to the liquid from which it was sepa
rated I added a few drops of diluted sulphuric acid : these
caused a separation of a minute quantity of sulphur, which was
got rid of by subsidence, after which I poured into it an aqueous
solution of the two sulphates of copper, and of black oxide of iron,
in which the former salt was to the latter by weight as 2 is to 3,
until no further effect was produced.       By these means I threw
down the whole of the sulphuretted chyazic acid contained in
the liquid, and collected it combined with protoxide of copper
in the form of an insoluble white salt, which weighed 9'7 grains.
    But as 100 grains of this salt contain 40'62 grains of sul
phuretted chyazic acid, composed of 26,39 sulphur and 14-23
prussic acid, according to my analysis, Phil. Trans, for 1814,
page 549, Exp. C. (corrected by calculations in the table facing
page 370 of the present paper), therefore the before-mentioned
9'7 grains represent 1'38 of prussic acid, which according to
this experiment is the quantity existing in 10 grains of prussiate
of mercury.
    D.  I had next to ascertain how much red oxide of mereurv
Was represented by the 37'2 grains of black sulphuret obtained
in Experiment B, and by the 9 3 grains of the same substance
obtained in Experiment C.       In order to effect this, I made the
following experiment:      25 grains of corrosive sublimate were
dissolved in water, and decomposed by hydro-sulphuret of pot
ash; the black'sulphuret thus formed weighed 21 '5 grains, which
therefore represents 19-94 grains of red oxide of mercury, that
                                                              being

       the Constitution   of the Prussic and other Acids, &c.       367
 being the quantity     contained    in 25 grains   of corrosive subli
 mate.

                       Analysis of Prussic Acid.
    Being Very   desirous   of accomplishing the analysis of this acid
 If possible, I considered very attentively the nature of the diffi
 culties to be surmounted in order to effect it.         The principal
 ones appeared to me to be the following.
     1st. 'That of always ascertaining with precision the quantity
 which is the subject of analysis.
    2d. That of effecting its combustion with oxygen in such a
 manner, that while, on the one hand, the whole of its carbon
 and hydrogen should be oxygenated; so, on the other, that none
 of its azote should undergo this process.
    3d. That of determining with great accuracy the quantity of
 oxygen which combines with the elements of the prussic acid!
 during its combustion, so as, after allowing for what has been
 expended in the formation of carbonic acid, to be able to infer
with confidence, from the disappearance of the rest, the quantity
 of hydrogen which was contained in the acid.
    The property which the prussic acid possesses of assuming the
liquid form at a low temperature, and that of a gas or vapour
at common temperatures, the volume of which is materially in
fluenced by mixture with other gases, and by slight alteration*
of temperature and pressure, did not appear to me to be favour
able to the employment of it in an uncombined form for the
purpose of its analysis.
    1 therefore determined upon employing        it in the state of con
densation    in which    it exists in  prussiate of   mercury, and this-
determination made me undertake the analysis I have just de
scribed of that salt ; of the correctness of which having satis
fied myself, I conceived that I had overcome the first difficulty.
    The second and third difficulties I thought would be best sur
mounted by employing, for the combustion of the prussic acid,
the same oxide with which it is united in the prussiate of mer-
eury, namely, the red oxide of that metal ; increasing the quan
tity of it by multiples of that which the salt contains, until I found
that the whole of the prussic acid was decomposed.
                                                                  1 made

368        Further analytical Experiments relative to
    I made a number of experiments upon this plan, the results
of which proved to me that the quantities of carbonic acid and
of azote gases produced, did nst arrive at the maximum until
five times the quantity of red oxide of mercurv contained in the
prussiate had been added to           making together six of that
                                       it,
oxide to one of prussic acid and that, whenever a less quantity
                                   ;
of the oxide than this had been employed, there always existed
in the gaseous products     portion of undecomposed prussic acid.
I  further observed, that   in a
                             all cases the volume of azote gas ob
tained was exactlv equal to that of the prussic acid decomposed,
that the volume of carbonic acid gas produced was invariably
twice that of the azote gas liberated in the same experiment, and
that the carbonic acid produced accounted for only' one-third of
the oxygen consumed.      The observance of these laws by which
the decomposition was regulated, enabled me       constructing the
                                                            in
following table (facing page 370,) to correct the minute and
unavoidable inaccuracies of experiment, by the superior accuracy
to be acquired    by  applying to the results so obtained, the cor
rections necessary to make them correspond with the above-
mentioned laws.        It enabled me also to represent in the column
denoting the measures of prussic acid gas, equal quantities               by
equal bulks; which, for the reasons before stated, experiment
does not exactly show, and thus to render evident the true pro
gress of its decomposition.
    Itmay be proper, before proceding further, to describe my
mode of operating in conducting the experiments from which
the table was compiled.         This .mode       similar in principle to
                                                  is
that   invented   by  Gay   Lussac    and Thenard     in their Analvsis of
Animal and Vegetable Substances, and improved by Berzeljus.
I am greatly indebted to these two French chemists for the
valuable information respecting this kind of analvsis, which              I
have obtained from their Rcckerchcs Physim-Cliymiqiies,                and
to Dr. Berzelius for that which         I have received from his paper
on the definite proportions in which the elements of organic
nature are combined, published in Dr. Thomson's Annals of
Philosophy for December last.           It    to this information that
                                             is                           I
principally   attribute  the  success   which  has attended the experi
ments    of a similar   nature  which  I  have  made.
   The method pursued         by  me, however, differs in several re
spects from that of either of the chemists just mentioned.
   1st. In the apparatus employed, which               much more simple
                                                       is
in my process.
   2dly. In the nature of the oxygenised body employed to effect
the combustion.
   3dlv. In the method to which          I   had recourse for propor
tioning the oxygenised to the combustible body,                  by
                                                              making the
                                                                      former

        the Constitution       of the Prussic    and other Acids,   &c.   369
former a multiple of that which enters into chemical union with
the latter.           i
   4thly. In decomposing a much less quantity of the combusti
ble body at a time, than either of the above chemists.
   In the present case, each of these alterations appeared to me
to possess very decided advantages over the other methods. How
far they may be applicable to other cases, I do not pretend to
determine.
   Having thus generally stated in what my process differed from
former ones, I proceed to rather a more particular description
of it.
  I prepare the peroxide of mercury which I employ, by decom
posing with pure soda, a solution of corrosive sublimate. Having
weighed out the proportions of prussiate of mercury, and of the
peroxide which I intend to decompose, I triturate them to
gether in a small polished mortar of porphyry or agate for se
veral minutes, then collect into the centre of the mortar what
adheres to its sides, and repeat this alternate trituration and
                                                                  '
collection at least six times.                                      .
   I then take a tube of glass 4| inches long, about the size of a
common writing quill and tolerably stout, I close one end of               it,
and bend the other round, so that nearly an inch of that end
forms    aright angle with the rest.       call this the retort tube.
                                                 I
I  make   asecond tube similar to the first, except that, instead of
being closed at one end,             open at both.
                                       it   is            call this the
                                                               I
adapting   tube.
   The retort tube     then charged with the mixed materials, by
                          is                                                 .

    A graduated glass tube, capable of containing about 2| cubic
inches, was next filled with mercury, and placed in the mer
curial pneumatic trough, not in the usual perpendicular posi
tion, but with its upper end raised, but very little, from the
horizontal situation, being about an inch above the surface ©f
the mercury, while its lower or open end just dipped below that
surface.   In this position, the long leg of the adapting tube was
passed up into      it,
                     which being open at both ends became filled
with mercury the short end of this tube was then connected

zontal one towards the table.       The decomposition was then
commenced, by applying the flame of a spirit-lamp to the empty
part of the tube, and bringing it down gradually, so as to ex
plode in succession the three strata of the mixture.        The ar
rangement of the apparatus at the commencement of the pro

   When the retort tube was cold, it was separated, under the
surface of the mercury, from the adapting tube, in such a man
ner, that any gas remaining in the latterjnight pass up into the
graduated tube : the volume of gas collected was then ascer
tained, making the necessary corrections for temperature, pres
sure, and the capacity of the retort tube ; after which a solution
of pure potash was passed up into it, and the diminution of
volume which it occasioned was noticed : from the gas which
remained, a deduction was made, for the quantity of atmospheric
air in the upper part of the retort tube before the combustion,
and which seldom exceeded -^th of a oubic inch : the residual
gas was considered as azote, and found to be so by all the tests to
which I subjected it. The small quantity of solution of potash
                                                                    I if,

     Iwas very well aware of the probability of my placing some
of   my analyses in a very unfavourable light, by contrasting the
results obtained by the application of a theory capable of giving
the composition of bodies with absolute certainty, witfh those
results which        I
                    have obtained by practical experiments on a
class of bodies hitherto little examined or understood, and the
analyses of which were very difficult: but I Would not allow this
consideration to have any influence in deterring me from making
such a contrast; for, as I had not the vanity to give these analyses
as perfect, so I feel no mortification in now proving      that they
were: not so ; and being confident that L had not spared either
time or trouble in making them, I expose their imperfections
without hesitation, confiding in the candid judgement of those
who,- having undertaken similar investigations, are aware of the
numerous difficulties and sources of error attendant upon them'.
   I have arranged and collected these comparisons into the
form of a Table, which            I
                             beg heave now to introduce.
   I infer from  the  Table, that the acids and salts included in       it,
are so composed as to harmdnize perfectly with the doctrines of
Dalton and Berzelius, and to be very compatible with the opi
nion respecting the compound nature of azote.
 I   shall be happy      this attempt to elucidate the nature and
                             if
composition   of  these bodies  adds in any degree to the daily and
rapid progress now making in chemical science.

LXIX. Dreadful              Accident occasioned   ly   the Explosion   of   a
     Boiler at Mr. Constant's Sugar-House in Well- Street               on
     the 13th    Novemler.
                of
It   has lately been ascertained that when the boiling of sugar,
in the process of refining,      carried on without any fire being
                                      is
allowed to come directly in contact with the pan,         waste of
                                                               a
sugar    isprevented, and    better article obtained.
                                  a                    On the pro
cess of refining we do not mean to offer any remarks, but merely
to speak of the accident which has occurred in consequence
of steam being employed, in an injudicious manner, to boil the
sugar' pans in place of fire as hitherto.     The arrangement was
simply this: — laTge close boiler was constructed for the pur
                 A
pose of generating steam, to be conveyed through tubes, under
the sugar pans, to bring them to the required temperature for
boiling the syrup.    These pans, made of copper, were each put
into an exterior pan made of cast iron, and closely joined at their
brim to prevent the escape of steam.       Only one pan we believe

           of a Boiler at a  'Sugar- Hmse in . Well-iStreet.
 had heen got ready to be worked in this wanner; and on the
  15th of November a teial was made of the boiler.
     Theifire was lighted. between three and four, o'clock in the
 morning. At .nine o'clock Mr., Hague the -sugineer canie to
 the premises, and it was.prpposed to provethebQiler.by.applying
 a large fire.    Mr. Constant the proprietor .objected, to the large
.fire; but through the obstinacy. of some of the engineer's men,
 as is believed, the fire wa$ urged unnecessarily, and even .the
 safety* valve,. provided for the escape of steam when the internal
 pressure should reach a certain. point, was overloaded to prevent
 the steam from escaping.       The consequence which might have
 been anticipated ;followed.      About half .past ten o'clock the
 boiler exploded, and with such a force as to bring down the
 whole building, burying a number .of.people in the ruins.        Trhe
 house was about 70 feet high, and of proportional depth and
 width. The effect of such an explosion may be more easily con
ceived than described.       Most miraculously, several of. the people
 who were buried in the ruins escaped without personal injury,
 the lower part of one of the walls .keeping up one end of the
joists of a part of the lower floor, which was thus thrown .over
them as & shed. In the course of the day ten other. people were
 dug out of the ruins, seven of them less or more burnt, lacerated
or bruised,. who ,were sent to the hospital, and three of them
-dead.    Among the latter was Mr. Spear jun. aged 15, son of
 Mr.-H. A. Spear of Broad-street, who was there at the time on
business, his, father having sent in a great quantity of sugar to
be manufactured .
    The.effects of this accident did not however end here.       After
the. ruins were partly removed, air getting to the wood which
had come in contact with the scattered .fire of the furnace^ the
whole, at ujght, burst out in a violent flame, whigh communi
cated to two .contiguous sugar-houses, also belonging to Mr.
Constant, which were entirely consumed.
    Great blame attaches somewhere ; and the accident is the less
excusable, as this is not the first arising from ignorance or inat
tention in the application of steam of high temperature to dif
ferent purposes.       Only a few months ago a loco-motive engine
was exploded in the country, and several people lost their lives,
from the folly of a man (calling himself an engineer, a name
now given to every person who is employed to throw coals under
a boiler,) locking down the safety valve, that his machine might
go off in style 1 And latterly, a salt-pan heated by steam was
blown up by a similar imprudence.          Such madness cannot .be
sufficiently reprobated.       Nothing is more manageable than
steam, in the hands of men of common prudence ; but nothing
more dangerous when fools and pretenders are suffered to play

with  it. The very idea of proving the boiler with steam sa
voured of insanity; for, if too weak, it could do nothing but
explode.   What would be said of the man who should seek to
ascertain the lowest heat at which gun-powder would explode,
by thrusting in succession into a barrel of that article, bars of
iron heated to different degrees of temperature ?
   When a large boiler is to be employed to generate steam of high
temperature, it should be proved, not with water and a fire applied
to   it,
      but with cold water forced in     a pump or syringe till the

most accurate way to ascertain the pressure                tube

ficient length connected with the boiler, and containing mercury.
 Should     aboiler subjected to this test prove too weak,          only it
rends at the weak part — no explosion takes place, and no one
can receive any personal injury.
    We went to the ruins on the 20th of November, and ascertained
several facts, indicating in our opinion either great ignorance or
great carelessness on the part of those who had the care of con
structing the boiler and pans. In the first place, as to the form of
the boiler itself, — was somewhat globular, with

the explosion took place.    Mr. Constant saw the gauge      few minutes her

     We need not stop to say much on the construction of the
sugar pans and the steam-case under them: suffice it to say, that
 on inquiry (for these had not been cleared from the ruins when
 we were on the spot*) we learnt that these also were eight feet
 in diameter — and, if we understood rightly, the bottom of
.each pan was nearly a plane, or had scarcely any discernible
rotundity. — Pans that are to be heated by strong steam should
 be narrow, to gain strength ; and the surface wanted for evapo
ration should be obtained by giving them sufficient length.
    Such accidents are much to be lamented, not only on account
of the individual and family sufferings which they occasion,
 but also for the impediments they serve to throw in the way of
 improvements in the manufactures of the country: for, though
it is certainly true that steam, as we have observed, is perfectly
manageable and safe in proper hands, yet wiien people witness
such calamities, and that under the management of people sup
posed to be competent, nothing can be more natural than that,
instead of encouraging, they should be led to oppose improve
 ments which threaten such dreadful consequences.

important discoveries by which the science has been enriched
during the few years that have elapsed since the publication o£
their former volumes."

       As a specimen of the style of the work, and the happy man
     ner in which the new facts are brought together and classed, so
     as to lay before the reader, in a condensed yet perspicuous detail,
       their application by their respective authors, and others who have
      illustrated them, we select a part of the article "Affinity."
          After noticing Berthollet's now exploded opinion, that it is
      the tendency of Chemical Affinity to combine bodies in all pro
      portions ; and also the opinion of Richter, Proust, and other
      eminent chemists, supported by a daily increasing body of ex
      periments, that substances unite in proportions which are ren
      dered definite by the sole operation of their mutual affinity, they
      notice Mr. Dalton's most important rule on this subject, that
      " where two bodies combine in different proportions, if the quan-
,     tlty of one of them be assumed as a fixed number, the propor
      tions of the other body that unite to it are in the simplest possible
      ratio to each other, being produced by multiplying the lowest
     proportion by a simple integral number, as 2, 3, 4, &c." — and
     then give the following illustration and application of the doc
      trine and the rule : —
          " Thus, for example, if a metal can combine chemically with
     different proportions of oxygen, if 100 of the metal take 9 of
     oxygen for the lowest degree of oxygenation, all the other de
     grees will be in the proportion of 100 of metal to twice 9 (18)
     of oxygen; or 100 of metal to three times 9 (27) of oxygen; or
      100 of metal to four times 9 (36) of oxygen, &c. &c. A reason
    'for this simplicity in the ratio of binary compounds may be
     found in the general principle assumed by Mr. Dalton, which                                 is,
     that  in   all cases the simple elements of bodies are disposed to
     unitcatom to atom singly, or           either
                                            if         in excess
                                                      is             exceedsit                   by
     a ratio to be expressed          some simple multiple of the number
                                     by
     of its atoms.
       "    Hence, from the relative weights of the constituent parts of
     a compound, Mr. Dalton infers the relative weights of the ulti
     mate particle or atom of each of these parts and, this being
                                                                ;

therefore, that there should be no other proportions of combina
tion between these two elements, unless indeed it be one that is
expressed by an even sub-division of one of these proportions, as
for example, 5 A to 7, 10£, 14, &c. of B; in which case the
 IO5 being resolvable into three portions of 3£ each, the number
expressing the relative weight of an atom of B must be reduced
to3| instead of 7, and consequently the several proportions of

that of B as 7,) let them each be examined in their separate
compounds with a third body C.          Then, suppose that in the
simplest binary compound of A and C, analysis discovers 3 parts
by weight of C, to 5 of A, it is assumed, that, as 5 is taken as
the numerical expression of an atom of A, the number express
ing an atom of C must be 3 ; and consequently, if this mode of
estimation be just, it will also be found by experiment that in the
simplest combination of C with B, 7 parts of B will unite ex
actly with 3 parts of C. This supposes indeed that this simple
combination of one atom of each body is known by experiment;
but even if this should not be the case, the general principle will
not be contravened,       instead of single portion of being found,

                                    by
however the numbers assumed are not perfectly accurate though
sufficient for the present purpose).     The substance of which as
far as we yet know the smallest relative weight enters into che

rison for the relative weight of the atom of all other bodies. The
only compound of hydrogen and oxygen that we know              water,      is
in. which the oxygen       to the hydrogen as

sumed that an atom of sulphuretted hydrogen contains an atom
of sulphur united to an atom of hydrogen, the relative weight of
an atom of sulphur must be 13.        To prove that this number 13

   phur one, or two, or three atoms of oxygen.
      " Now, according to Mr. Dalton, Sulphureous acid actually
   contains 13 parts by weight of sulphur to 14 of oxygen, and
   therefore its atom consists of one atom of sulphur to two atoms
   of oxygen ; and Sulphuric acid consists of 13 parts by weight of
   sulphur to '21 of oxvgen, or one atom of the former to three
   atoms of the latter.
      " This hypothesis therefore is perfectly consistent ia the above
  examples.
      " The comparative weight of each atom being thus ascertain
   ed, the relative diameter of the atom is found by comparing its
   relative weight with the specific gravity of the substance of which
   the atom is an integrant particle.    But as this part of Mr. Dal
   ton 's system is not essential to our present purpose, we shall not
   pursue it.
      " Not only do elementary atoms unite in definite proportions,
   but also compound particles unite in the same manner.          Thus
   both sulphuric acid and potash are compound particles, being
  each oxyds, the one of sulphur and the other of potassium. But
  as potash combines with two different proportions of sulphuric
   acid, one being just double the quantity of the other, the com
  pound, sulphat of potash, may with propriety be considered as
  composed of an atom of potash with an atom of sulphuric acid,
  and the compound, svper-sulphut of potash, may be considered
  as consisting of one atom of potash to two atoms of sulphuric
  acid.
      " Mr. Dalton gives the term Binary atom to any compound
  of two elements in which one atom of each is combined, and
  hence there can be but one species of binary compound of any
  two elements.
*     " A Ternary Atom is composed of two atoms of one of the
  elements with one atom of the other, and hence there may be
  two species of ternary atoms of the same element, according as
  one or other is in the greater proportion.      Thus an atom of ni
  trous oxyd is a ternary compound of two atoms of azote and one
  atom of oxygen ; and on the other hand, nitrous acid is also a
  ternary compound of the same elements, but consisting of one
  atom of azote with two atoms of oxygen.
      "  A Quaternary Atom is composed of three atoms of one
  element with one atom of the other, and hence also there may
  be two species of quaternary atoms as either element predomi
  nates ; and so on of the other numbers.
      "  We shall now proceed to mention a number of facts that
  illustrate in a striking manner the chemical union of substances
  in definite proportions.
                                                                   « If

     " If one   measure of pure oxygen and two measures of hydro
  gen be mixed in a jar over mercury, and ignited -by the electric
  spark, both the gasses will disappear, and water will be produced.
  If two measures of each gas be used, water will be produced as
 before, but one measure of oxygen will remain. Hydrogen there
 fore unites with water in one exact proportion, and in ho other.
     " If a piece of well burnt charcoal be confined in oxygen gas,
  and inflamed by a burning glass, the volume of gas is not al
  tered when again cooled, but the whole is converted into car
 bonic acid gas. If more oxygen be present than is necessary for
  the consumption of the charcoal, the products will be carbonic
  acid gas and an excess of oxygen ; if there is less oxygen than
 will consume the charcoal, carbonic acid alone will be produced,
  and part of the charcoal will remain unconsumed.
     " The combination of two elements in several definite (propor
  tions is very happily shown by the various compounds of oxygen
  and azote. These are nitrous oxyd, nitrous gas, and nitrous acid
 gas.
       If two   measures of Nitrous Oxyd and two measures of hy
  drogen   are   ignited by the electric spark, the product is water,
 and two measures of azote remain.            Now, as water is produced

 azote with one of oxygen condensed into the space of one mea

     " If charcoal is ignited in two measures of Nitrous gas, the
 products are one measure of carbonic acid gas and one measure
 of azote. Hence, as carbonic acid gas always occupies the same
 volume as the oxygen of which it is formed, nitrous gas consists
 of equal volumes of oxygen and of azote not condensed! by their
 union.
    '"If  two measures of nitrous gas be mixed over water with one
 measure of oxygen gas, both of them 'totally disappear, and a
 solution of Nitrous acid gas in water is the result.

 of some super-acid andsub-aeid salts*, which may bei here men-

and afterwards let the gas be expelled from it in the same appa

that obtained from the two grains of crystallized salt in the
former experiment.
     " The same results are obtained from the super-carbonat and
the sub-carbonat of soda.
     " Super-sulphat of potash, in like manner, contains twice the
quantity of acid as the neutral sulphat.         Let twenty grains of
carbonat of potash      be  mixed  with   about   twenty-five grains of
sulphuric acid in a covered platina crucible, or in a glass tube,
and this mixture gradually heated till it ceases to boil, and be
comes slightly red-hot.       This will produce the super-sulphat of
potash, which will be very nearly neutralized by an addition of
20 grains of the same carbonat of potash.
     " The common super-oxalat of potash is shown by Dr. Thom
son to consist of potash united to twice the quantity of oxalic
acid necessary to saturate- it.    If two equal portions of this su
per-oxalat    be taken,  and one  portion  calcined, so as to destroy
the acid, the alkali that remains will be just sufficient to saturate
the other portion.
     " When nitric or muriatic acid is added to the common super-
oxalat of potash, the latter salt is only partially decomposed, and
crystals form in the mixture, which are found on examination to
be a Quadroxalat of Potash, or potash with four times as much
acid as will saturate it.
     " The formation of these various salts with a definite excess
of acid, which is expressed by a simple multiple of the least de
finite quantity, is particularly important, as it affords an answer
to the powerful objection urged by M. Berthollet against the
common opinion of chemical affinity.            This eminent chemist
shows that a considerable excess of a weaker acid will decom
pose a compound of a base and a stronger acid ; for example,
that a large quantity of nitric acid added to sulphat of potash
will occasion some crystals of nitre to form, though the nitric
acid has a weaker affinity to potash than the sulphuric. But
though there is an undoubted decomposition of some portion of
the sulphat of potash in this case,     it.
                                         is ishighly probable that for
every particle of nitre formed there         an equivalent quantity of
a super-sulphat of potash produced, in equally definite propor
tions with the neutral sulphat, and in which, probably, the aeid
is   in the ratio ofa   simple multiple of that which exists in the
neutral salt.                                                 .  '

        Among the philosophers who within these last few years
have laboured with the greatest zeal and success in discovering
the laws of chemical affinity,  a  distinguished place   is  due to Pro
                                                                   fessor

fessor Berzelius*, whose experiments we shall now briefly notice.
He states that he was led to this train of inquiry from the two
following most important theorems laid down by the learned
Richter    :
   "1.   When two bodies, A and B, have each an affinity for two
others, C and D, the C which saturates a given quantity of A
is to the D which saturates the same quantity of A, in the same
proportion as the C saturating any given quantity of B is to
the D saturating the same quantity of B. Hence the saturating
proportions of A C, A D, and B C being known, those of B D
maybe found by simple calculation.             For example, let A, B, C,
and D be respectively sulphuric acid, muriatic acid, barytes, and
potash, and let 100 parts of sulphuric acid be saturated by 190
of barytes. and by 116 of potash, and let 100 of muriatic acid
be saturated by 281 of barytes, then the quantity of potash sa
turating 100 of muriatic acid will be 173;
                 Bar.       Pot.          Bar.      Pot.
             for 190    :    116    ::    281    :   173 nearly.
This law of chemical combination            is indeed a direct inference
from the fact, that, when two neutral salts are mixed together,
and decompose each other, the mixture remains neutral. Thus,
supposing 381 parts of muriat of barytes be exactly decomposed
by 322 parts of sulphat of potash, and the mixture remain neu
tral, the respective proportions of the new compounds formed
will be 273 of muriat of potash, and 430 of sulphat of barytes,
as by the following scheme :

    " The respective proportions       of potash and barytes that saturate
any   acid   are always   as  173 : 2S1,   and in the decomposition here
assumed the muriatic acid that saturates these bases is 100 parts.
Therefore the sulphuric acid must be 149 parts, as calculated
both from the elements of sulphat of potash and sulphat of ba
rytes.     In the former case 116 of potash saturate 100 parts of
sulphuric acid, and 116 : 100 : : 173 : 149.              In the latter case

     Another equally important law laid down by Richter      that                 is,
 when the metal of         neutral metallic solution              is
                                                         precipitated                    by
                         is a
 another metal,     it     the metallic base alone which        changed,    is
 the oxygen and the acid remaining united with the last added
 metal.     Hence   itfollows that all the different metallic oxyds
 which saturate     definite portion of acid contain the same quan
                    a
 tity of oxygen.    Or in other words         may be expressed, that
                                              it                                          a
 given quantity of any acid combines to saturation with only           de          a
 finite proportion of oxygen united to so much of any base as con
 tains this portion of oxygen.       Thus for example,       100 parts of
                                                                       if
 sulphuric acid saturate 20 parts of oxygen and the base united
 with      the proportion of every oxyd that combines with 100 of
         it,
 sulphuric acid, and the composition of every neutral sulphat                            is
 known as soon as the oxyd itself        isanalyzed.    And, conversely,
 the composition of any unknown oxyd may be discovered               find         by
 ing the quantity of this oxyd which neutralizes         given weight of
                                                                  a
 any acid whose saturating quantity of oxygen in any other oxyd
is   previously known.       Thus, for example,        100 parts of sul
                                                             if
 phuric acid saturate any oxyd that contains 20 of oxygen,            may         it
 be inferred that 116 parts of potash are composed of 20 of oxy
 gen and 96 of potassium, since this quantity of potash saturates
 100 of sulphuric acid. The like quantity of oxygen             therefore   is
contained in 78 of soda, in 190 of barytes, &c. &c. each of
which saturate 100 of sulphuric acid.
    " The late discovery of the compound nature of the alkalies
and earths, therefore, gives an additional importance to this law
 of chemical affinity.
     " Another law of chemical combination, which              laid downis
by Berzelius,    and   illustrated  by numerous    examples,      the fol    is
lowing: viz.    In any compound       of two oxydated substances, that
substance which          attracted to the positive pole of the electric
                        is
circuit (the acid, for example,) contains as much oxygen as                              is
produced        multiplying the oxygen of the substance attracted
               by
to the negative pole (such as alkali, earth, metallic oxyd,) by
some of the integral numbers             2,   3,    &c. For example,
                                                   4,   5,
as 100 parts of sulphuric acid saturate          as  much of any oxyd.
as contains about 20 parts of oxygen, the quantity of oxygen
in 100 parts of the acid itself must be equal to twice 20, or
three times 20, &c. In this example             will be shown presently

  that sulphuric aoid contains almost exactly three times 20, or
  60 per cent, of oxygen. Most of the other acids, however, con
  tain only twice the oxygen of their saturating base : the carbonic
  and sulphureous acids are of this kind.
      " In all the compounds in which water forms an element
  (which are all the crystallized salts and liquid acids) this sub
 stance also seems to be subjected to some similar law of definite
 proportion, as will be soon explained.
     "We shall now give a short abstract of a few of the impor
  tant series of Prof. Berzelius' experiments, to show to what de
 cree they illustrate and confirm the above laws of chemical com
 bination, together with some others which will be stated in their
 place.
     " The    composition of sulphuric acid which has so often been
 attempted was ascertained in several methods ; and first through
 thfr medium of the oxyd and sulphuret of lead.
     " Lead and Oxygen. Lead has three degrees of oxygenation,
 viz. the yellow, the red, and the brown.
     ee
        For the yellow oxyd, some pure lead (reduced from the ni-
 trat of lead) was dissolved in nitric acid evaporated and ignited;
 a hundred parts of metal thus gained 7^8 of oxygen.
     "  The red oxyd, or purified minium, contains to 100 of metal
                             1
 11.07 oxygen.
     " The brown oxyd formed by digesting minium in nitric acid,
 contains to 100 of metal 15.6 of oxygen.
    "   Therefore these portions of oxygen, viz. 7-8; 11.07; and
 1-5.6, are respectively in the proportions of 1, 1*§, and 2.
    " The yellow oxyd is the only one which enters into the salts
 of lead.
    " Lead and Sulphur. 100 parts of lead mixed with as much
pure sulphur, and heated in a close vessel, as long as any sulphur
was sublimed, produced 115.6 of the sulphuret; so that 100
parts of lead, when thus united with sulphur, absorb 15.6, which
is exactly twice the weight of oxygen united with the same quan
tity of lead in the yellow oxyd.          On this coincidence a law of
combination is deduced, which will be presently mentioned.
    " This sulphuret of lead is therefore thus composed :
                      Lead.         100         86.51

    " A hundred     parts of the sulphuret of lead last described were
digested    in nitro-muriatic   acid till the whole was converted Lnto
sulphat of lead, the sulphur and lead both acquiring oxygen from
the nttro-muriatic acid. No product whatever was yielded from
                                                                   the

             things are to be particularly noticed here :
    " One   of them   is : that the sulphur of the sulphuret of lead
was exactly sufficient, when converted to sulphuric acid, to sa
turate the lead of the same sulphuret when converted to the suh-
oxyd of lead.
    " The other thing to be noticed is : that the quantity of the
sulphur in the sulphuret was almost exactly double the quantity
of oxvgeu taken up by the lead of the sulphuret, being as 13.49
to 6.748.
    "  From the former of these facts the author infers as a ge
 neral rule, that a metal combines with sulphur in such a propor
tion, that when the sulphur is converted to sulphuric acid, and
 the metal to an oxyd, the sole product will be a neutral sul-
 phated oxyd of the same metal.
    " From the latter of these two facts the author infers, that in
 every neutral sulphat the oxygen of the base equals half the
weight of the sulphur of the acid with which it is saturated.
    " The composition of sulphuric acid is inferred from the above
oxydation of sulphuret of lead, to be in the proportion of 13.49
of sulphur to 19.752 of oxygen, the whole addition of oxygen
 to the sulphuret being 26.5, and 6.748 of this being estimated
 as the portion belonging to the oxyd of lead.
    " Sulphuric acid therefore consists of
                  Sulphur  ...  .40.58 — 100.000
                  Oxygen   ....  59.42  — 146.426

 tioned, 100 parts of sulphuric acid therefore will saturate so
 much of any oxydated base as contains 40g5 8 = 20'29 of oxy
  gen.
    " As an    exact determination of the elements of sulphuric acid
 is of great importance in analysis, the author proceeds to com
  pare the above-mentioned result with those produced* by other
  modes of operating.

of this acid by acidifying a given quantity of sulphur, and then
 combining it with the barytes of a known quantity of som.e so
luble barytic salt.     The analysis of sulphat of barytes depends
also on that of carbonat of barytes, out of which all the barytic
salts are prepared.      By multiplied experiments the author fixes

from 11 8*6 to 119 parts of sulphat of barytes, which will give

    "  Bucholz acidified 100 parts of fused sulphur with nitro-
 muriatic acid, and by combining with barytes the sulphuric acid
 thus produced obtained 724 parts of sulphat of barytes?         If this
 sulphat  is  estimated  according  to  Berzelius's result above given,
 its acid part will be 246*16, whence 100 parts of sulphur will
 have combined with 146\16 of oxygen, and this estimation of
 sulphuric acid will be found to correspond almost exactly with
 that already given as found by the acidification of sulphuret of
lead.
    " Sulphureous    Acid. The production of this acid by the di
rect combustion of sulphur being attended with nearly insupe
rable difficulties, Pr. Berzelius attempted its analysis by means of
the sulphite of ammonia.        This salt was decomposed by muriat
of barytes, and the resulting sulphite of barytes was changed to
the sulphat of barytes, by means of nitric acid, none of the sul
phureous acid being expelled in the process.        By these and other
experiments the author determines the elements of sulphureous
 acid to be            Sulphur 50-57 — 100-00
                       Oxygen    49-43 — 97'83

    " The    oxygen in the sulphureous acid is therefore to that in
the sulphuric acid very nearly as 1 : 1 { ; as 100 parts of sulphur
unite with 97'83 of oxvgen in the sulpbureous, and with 146*426
in the sulphuric, and 79 83 X 11 = 146-785.

equals half the weight of the sulphur in the acid.

gen   of the acid equals that of the base multiplied by some inte
gral number.      To this mav be added the other law of all che
mical combination (which is entirely adopted by the author)
namely,

the quantity of one of them be assumed as a fixed number, the
proportions of the other body are in the simplest ratio to each
other, being produced by multiplying the lowest proportion by
some integral number."

                         ROYAL SOCIETY.
   Nov. 9.   T  his Society again assembled after the long vaca
tion; the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. President, in the
eh air.
    A very important paper by Sir Humphry Davy was read, On
the Nature of the Fire-damp in Coal-mines, and the Means of
preventing its Explosion.
    In this paper Sir H. Davy describes a very simple lantern,
which he calls the Safe Lantern, for preserving the lives of colliers
in mines liable to explosions from the fire-damp.
    By various chemical experiments Sir H. Davy ascertained that
the fire-damp is the least combustible, and least expansive in
combustion, of all the inflammable gases ; ar.d that explosive
mixtures of fire-damp have their explosive power destroyed by
small admixtures of azote and carbonic acid : and likewise that
explosions from the fire-damp are incapable of passing through
small glass or metallic tubes.
   On these principles his lantern is founded, which is an air-tight
Apparatus having small air tubes below, through which an ex
plosion cannot pass ; and a chimney above, in which the admix
ture of azote and carbonic acid always prevents the possibility
of explosion.
   The candle or wick in burning forms the quantity of azote and
 earboujc acid necessary to lower explosive mixtures, should they
                                B b 2                           exist

    exist in the atmosphere, below the explosive point : and when
    the atmosphere becomes dangerous the flame enlarges, and is
    then extinguished, and the miners are warned that it is proper to
    leave this part of the mine till it is properly ventilated.
       With a common candle, when the air becomes explosive, life
    is extinguished; with the Safe Lantern, the only inconvenience
    is a temporary loss of light.
        It appears that Sir Humphry found the utmost facility in
    pursuing his researches, when travelling in the coal-mining di
    stricts, and that all persons seemed equally eager and confident
    that he should discover some means of alleviating, if not entirely
    preventing, the dreadful calamities which so often occur in coal
    mines.      This fact is perfectly sufficient to refute the silly ca
     lumnies which have been so liberally heaped on the heads and
     hearts of a number of the most respectable and humane charac
     ters in the kingdom.      It requires neither talents nor knowledge
     to charge any    man  or class  of men with inhumanity; but it is
     an act which no truly humane or benevolent man can do with
     out the plainest, most unequivocal and often repeated evidence.
     It is now, indeed, sufficiently evident that they must be very bad
     observers of natural phsenomena, who could so grossly confound
     the rational dictates of prudence arising from long experience
     and baffled philanthropy, with apathy and vulgar inhumanity !
     We cannot be surprised that such persons have not discovered
     an adequate mode of modulating or extinguishing the fire-damp
     of coal-mines; neither can we be at a loss to account for their
     accusations.     Let us hope, however, that as this last discovery
     of Sir Humphry must be eminently serviceable to humanity, it
     may also contribute to teach sciolists, in future, the necessity of
      observing and thinking before writing and accusing.
         Nov. 16. A Supplement to Sir Humphry Davy's paper was
      read.   It contained some additional evidence of the perfect
      adequacy of his
                         " Safe Lantern" to preserve the miners from
      the dangers of explosion.
         Sir H. began his researches on the fire-damp in a manner
      very different from that of preceding chemists : his first inquiry
      was, to ascertain what is the peculiar composition of this gas ?
-     what are- its explosive powers? and in what combinations it
      is most dangerous to miners, or with what admixtures it is
      rendered inert?     He found that it is tolerably pure carburetted
      hydrogen gas ; that it contains neither olefiant nor sulphuretted
      hydrogen gas, like the common product of coals by distillation.
      He then proceeded to ascertain its combustible powers : burning
      charcoal does not inflame it,   if there be no blaze, and iron must
      be at a white heat to fire it.    One part oxygen to one of fire
      damp produced   a    mixture slightly combustible;     but the most
                                                              combustible

 combustible    mixture oonsisted of six or seven parts oxygen to
  one of fire-damp. With mixtures of atmospheric air it is also
  combustible ; and i» appears that even one part fire-damp to
  30 parts of the atmosphere increased the flame of a candle, and
  gave it a blueish tinge; but that with one part fire-damp to 15
  parts atmospheric air it is perfectly harmless.    It required two
 parts oxygen   to one   of fire-damp to produce one part of car
 bonic acid.     Lastly, one part of azote or of carbonic acid ren
 ders it wholly incombustible; and as the chimney of Sir Hum
 phry's "Safe Lantern" must necessarily be always supplied with
 this gaseous matter, it is scarcely possible to conceive any thing
 more effectual, or more likely to answer all the expectations of
 the most sanguine philanthropist.      It seems, reasoning theore
 tically, to combine in an unprecedented degree all the requisites
 of simplicity, portability, oeconomy and elficacy, which are ne
 cessary to the common purpose of manual labour.         We cannot
 therefore doubt that it may be the means of preserving many
 useful lives, and that it will prove to the coal-miners a " per
 fectly safe lantern."
    The reading of a paper by F. Daniel, Esq. F.R.S. was begun,
and continued on
    Nov. 23.    It was An experimental Inquiry into the Process of
Crystallization, and the Effects of Solution on the Structure of
Crystals. The author's object was to verify, if possible, the hy
pothesis of the sphericity of molecules.       He began by making
solutions of alum, nitrates of copper and of potash, &c.       These
solutions took two or three weeks to yield regular crystals ;
they began by depositing a sediment which gradually assumed oc-
tohedral, rhomboidal, &c, forms.       Experiments of this nature
he varied with great industry and ingenuity, and detailed mi
nutely the results.     His next object was to observe the changes
which took place in crystals during solution.      He weighed cer
tain crystals, immersed them in a given portion of water, left them
to remain in the fluid so many hours, then withdrew them, wiped
them dry with blotting paper, ascertained what weight they had
lost, and what were the modifications produced on their crystal
line structure : he again immersed them in water for a limited
time, and repeated his observations. This process he continued
some days, always carefully noting the changes evinced on the
exterior form of the crystals, the modulations or changes of their
angles, the operations of the solvent on their faces, sides or sum
mits, the parts which disappeared entirely or became truncated,
&c.     These results were illustrated by figures, without which it
would not have been possible to render them intelligible. A
considerable diversity occurred in the changes which the different
 crystals experienced; but all were more or less truncated, at
                                   B b3                         least

 least one side or other.      Mr. D. then entered into a somewhat
 elaborate inquiry into the differences which should have appeared
 had the primitive molecules of crystals been cubes and not
 spheres; and some of his facts he admitted were favourable to
 the former hypothesis, but more to the latter.       In observing that
 the crystalline masses formed at the bottom of the vessels by
 spontaneous evaporation often presented very different geometric
 figures, and totally dissimilar to the forms usually ascribed to
  such salts by mineralogists, he was induced to consider the effects
  of mechanical agency in t he product of such anomalies. Notwith
  standing these and some other discrepancies, he is however in
  clined to consider Dr. Wollaston's theory of molecular sphericity
  as perfectly satisfactory,    and the best adapted to explain the
  phaenomena of nature.        Mr.   D. considers it an additional proof
  of the infinite wisdom of the great Author of nature, that the
^-molecules of our globe should have the same form as those al
  most incomprehensibly great orbs which appear in the heavens.

  Da. J    . R. Coxe    has made some experiments       on the crystalli -
  zation of salts, which in some respects contradict the generally-
  received opinions respecting that process.         He found, contrary
  to the notion of air being necessary to the consolidation of cry
  stals, that solutions of nitrate of potash, muriate of ammonia,
  and Glauber's salt, put into a phial at the boiling temperature^
                                                                           '
   and either corked or closely covered with a piece of bladder, fre-
  quently deposited regular crystals as the mass cooled without
  any exposure to the atmospheric pressure.         On the other hand,
  saturated solutions of these salts remained uncorked and exposed
  to the atmospheric pressure during three days without any con
  solidation. These experiments have been varied and repeated
  in different sized vessels, and always with the same anomalous re
   sults. Nor did any material difference appear when the water was
  fully saturated, or only charged with the salts. Solutions of these
   salts even on shaking sometimes did not immediately crystallize,
   while at others they yielded crystals without any apparent cause.
   Sometimes he had regular transparent crystals two inches long ;
   in other instances, only irregular masses at the bottom of the
   vessel. All the rapidly-formed crystals, as might be expected,
   were spongy, soft, striated, and had a satin-like aspect ; and
  the hasty crystallization always began at the surface.       While in
   some cases regular crystals were formed at the bottom of both

corked and uncorked phials, afterwards a solid crust has formed
in the upper part of the phials, without any obvious cause. Dr. C.
considers it the most singular and inexplicable fact, that whert
regular, firm, transparent crystals are deposited (under all the
above circumstances), as soon as the remaining saturated solution
above them consolidates, the first formed crystals almost instantly
lose their transparency, and become of a porcelain white colour.
He ascribes this change to the abstraction of water of crystalli
zation, as he found that the whitish mass, when dissolved in wa
ter and again crystallized, afforded a quantity of transparent
crystals heavier than the original white ones.     In this and in all
the other experiments Dr. Coxe has taken no notice of the ac
tion of light, nor does he appear to be aware that light has a
potent influence on crystallization.       Dr. Brewster's ingenious
and successful experiments ou the effects of saline solutions on
rays of light, prove the necessity of attending to their influence
in all experiments of this kind. Dr. C. has tried similar experi
ments with solutions of alum, sulphates of magnesia, iron, cop
per, and zinc, muriate of lime and subcarbonate of soda, with
out any very notable dissimilarity.      But so uncertain and irre
gular were the results, that in no case could he anticipate them.
 He thinks, indeed, that his experiments fully disprove the theory
of latent heat, which has itself become latent long ago, as water
saturated at 212" remained fluid and transparent even at the
freezing point, although the theory ascribes its solvent power to
the temperature.
    A QUESTION RESPECTING THE COMPARATIVE            STRENGTH Ot
                             OAK AND FIR.
                            To Mr. Tilloch.
    Sm,— In most of the authors who have written on the strength
of materials, we meet with the following assertion, viz. " Oak
will suspend much more than fir, but fir will support twice as
 much as oak."       As it is of some importance to the practical
 mechanic     to know   how far   this statement  may be depended
upon, I would thank any of your correspondents to inform me,
 if the above assertion rests on any better authority than that of
 Muschenbrock's experiments with pieces four feet long and
 7-10ths of an inch square?      For it would be easy to show that
 the repulsive force of oak, or of any other material, could not
 be ascertained by these experiments.
     I have tried several experiments on both kinds of timber, and
 find that oak will both suspend and support more than fir, the
  specimens being equally good of their kinds.

    On the 13th of October last, a family of six persons residing
 in the commune of Samans, in the department of the High
 Garonne, were poisoned        partaking plentifully,
                                      by                  mistake, of  by
 a poisonous species of mushrooms.         They   were   all speedily
 seized with drowsiness, and remained several hours without any
 signs of life.  At day-break they awoke, but in       state of pera
 fect imbecility the pulse was very low, and betokened speedy
                     :
 dissolution.   The surgeon first called wished them to swallow
 pil, but none was to be procured.        An ecclesiastic who was
 called  in, made them  drink copiously of milk.    Long and violent
 vomitings came pn, and the remedy succeeded perfectly; for a few
 hours after the whole family were declared free from danger.

        DEATH OF THE CELEBRATED ORIEtiTIAL TRAVELLER
                              DR. SEETZEN.'
     The readers of The Philosophical Magazine have from time to
 time been made acquainted with the progress of this most inde
 fatigable and truly enlightened traveller.       We lament to state,
 that like our estimable countrymen Major Houghton and Mungo
  Park, the earthly career of Dr. Seetzen has been prematurely
 terminated; and, alas! not without ground for the strongest su
 spicion that he has fallen a victim to the barbarous policy or
 cupidity of an Arab chief.      We select from a Bombay paper of
  May 25, the following elegant tribute to his memory, and suc
 cinct detail of his short but useful public life.
      "Among the few travellers whose thirst of knowledge and in
  trepidity of mind have directed their views towards exploring the
  interior regions of Africa,and whose labours have so uniformly been
  interrupted by a lamented and untimely fate, — Dr. Seetzen, a Ger
 man gentleman of considerable talent, and distinguished qualifica
  tions for the arduous task of discovery, seems to have been lest
  known to the world than most of his predecessors in that path, al
 though his want of notoriety arose rather from a retiring modesty
  of character than from anydericiencyof claim on the gratitude and
 admiration of the friends and patrons of civilization and know
 ledge. — Of the early part of this traveller's history nothing
 further is known to the writer than that he was a native of Saxony,
  had passed through a regular course of studies as Doctor of
  Medicine, and had added to his professional acquirements an in
  timate knowledge of botany, mineralogy, and natural history in
 general,    besides an acquaintance with oriental languages, and
  particularly a proficiency in the Arabic.
      " So rare an union of science and learning;, with a robust con
  stitution, unshaken courage, and enthusiasm in the pursuit of
  knowledge, had recommended him to the notice of the Duke of           .
  Saxe Gotha, by whom he was introduced also to the Emperor
  of Austria, and the learned Orientalists of Vienna, who were then
  engaged in their first labours on Les Mines d' Orient.
      " Under the joint patronage of these distinguished characters,
  he left Europe about the year 1807, on a tour through Syria and
   Palestine, chiefly with a view to improve his qualifications for
   the great work of exploring Africa, by gradually bringing him
  self to suffer the greatest privations, by familiarising his habits
   to those of savage life, and by acquiring a facility in the collo
   quial dialects of Arabic, which would enable him to pass for a
   native of that country.
        During his stay in Syria, he visited Palmyra, Balbec, Lebanon,
* Jerusalem, and the intermediate scenes of sacred or profane his
                                                                  tory;

tory; but his most interesting tour was through the plains of the
Hauran, east of the river Jordan, and the Dead Sea ; a wide and
now desert tract, chiefly peopled by Wandering Bedouin tribes,
though abounding with ruined cities, and traces of formeT opu
lence and cultivation, in canals, bridges, and other public works
of utility.   As it was a district, too, entirely unknown to Euro
peans, his researches as a naturalist were abundantly successful ;
 and the scientific world had much to hope from his discoveries
 even here, particularly in his mineralogical acquisitions, and his
 examination of the shores and waters of the lake Asphaltes, con
cerning which so many pious falsehoods had been circulated, to
gratify the taste of those who still believed the hissing bubbles of
the burning brimstone that swallowed Sodom and Gomorrah to
be visible, and who devoutly inferred that no animal could sus
tain without suffocation the fumes sent up by this sink of pa
triarchal abomination.
    " In Egypt, the labours of Dr. Seetzen were chiefly directed
to researches of science, particularly in correcting the errors of
 Sonnini as a naturalist, and exploring the vast field which that
interesting country offers to the geologist and the agricultural
observer.
     " At Cairo, where he remained some months occupied in the
arrangement of his materials, specimens and observations, he
.was personally known to most of the European inhabitants, who
universally speak of him as a man of extensive general informa
tion, profound scientific knowledge, extraordinary qualities of
disposition, in the union of patience, fortitude enterprise, and
gentleness of manners, and possessed of every qualification likely
to insure success.
    " From Egypt he appears to have sent to Vienna all the valuable
specimens which he had been enabled to collect in the different
departments of science, as well as copious observations on the
sacred and literary antiquities of Palestine, and the manners of
the Bedouin tribes who range the extensive plains of the eastern
deserts: on both of which subjects his inquiring turn of mind,
and invincible emancipation from the shackles of Vulgar preju
dice, enabled him to exercise a clear unbiassed judgement, and
to give the best and most impartial account of them that has
ever been written, since the intelligent remarks of the philoso
phic Volney.
    " Horeb and Sinai, as the venerable mount of early miracle,
from amid the lightning of whose terrific brow the thunders of
the Decalogue were first rolled forth, next attracted Dr. Seetzen's
attention ; but although he was not successful in discovering the

scenes of early wonders shown to travellers by the pious Greeks
of Santa Catherina; yet his travels through that route, and their
continuation through the unfrequented paths of Arabia Petraea,
brought to light a mass of information.
  "  After his tour through the northern part of Arabia, and from
thence into the Hedjaz, Dr. Seetzen reposed a few months at
Mecca, where he mingled with the crowd of pilgrims that an
nually assemble there from every quarter of the eastern world ;
and by the disguise of a long black beard, an Arab dress, an in
timate acquaintance with all the doctrines and ceremonies of Is-
lamism, and a proficient fluency of expression in the various
dialects of the Arabic tongue, he acquired the title of Hadjee
Moosa, after performing a pilgrim's duties ; when he quitted the
Holy City, without a suspicion having once been excited of his
want of veneration for the Caaba and the Prophet.
   " From Mecca, he journeyed through the southern territories
of the Hedjaz with a caravan, and reached Saana, the capital of
the Yemen, through a route before untravelled by any European;
from whence he continued his tour through the most fertile parts
of Arabia Felix, and arrived at length at Mocha, bringing with
him the spoils which his intrepidity alone had gained. him, in bo
tanical, mineialogical, and other specimens of natural history.
Like the collection of the industrious Niebuhr, it had scarcely
entered the gates of Mocha before it was seized by the rapacious
Dola,; under the hope of its containing immense treasures ; but
finding himself miserably disappointed in his estimation of their
value, as if to avenge himself for       it,   by
                                                securing at least their
loss to the proprietor, he caused them all to be conveyed to the
 Imaum of Saana, under     a    pretence of their being intended for
 the exercise of magic and incantation.        They were accordingly
 confiscated, and for ever lost to the proprietor of them, who
 seemed only to be stimulated thereby to greater undertakings in
 the way of arduous research.
   "   During Dr. Seetzen's stay at Mocha, he invariably bore the
 character of  a  Mussulman dervish, under the name of Hadjee
 Moosa nor does
       ;           it   appear that he was known to any of the na
 tives even there, as an European, his disguise being (as was be
  fore observed) complete ;    and his prudence was carried so far,
  that he never vis;.ted any of the factories there, although Captain
  Rudland, who was at that moment the East India Company's
  Agent in the Gulph, gave him repeated invitations, and paid him
  every indirect attention which he could be prevailed on to re
  ceive; his constant residence being in the common caravanserah
   of Mohammedan travellers.— had been the general opinion of
                                 It

 who depended solely on their consuls in Egypt for information,
 that Dr. Seetzen had met his death in Africa, in some wars
 among the Samaulies in Berbera ; but it is confidently asserted
 at Mocha that he did not once cross over even to the opposite
 coast. After some stay there, wasted in ineffectual endeavours to
 obtain a restoration of his seized specimens, he formed the de
 termination of revisiting Saana in person, and of journeying from
 thence to the eastern extremity of Arabia, to cross from Muscat
 into Persia, and return again to Syria, from whence he would at
 length enter on his great undertaking.
    " For this purpose he left Mocha in the month of October 181 1,
 having with him a number of camels laden with baggage, pro
 visions, scientific apparatus, &c.; when three days only after his
 departure information was received of his sudden death near Tais,
 and the consequent dispersion of all his property.         No doubt
 seems to have been entertained,      even by the Arabs themselves
 who were of his party, that he was poisoned by some agents of
 the Dola among them, with the connivance, or perhaps at the
 express orders of the Imaum, to wrench from him the little mite
 he possessed, and to remove him effectually beyond the power
 of remonstrance.
    " Beyond this, nothing further is positively known as to the
 detail of his sufferings ; but the fact of his having died a sudden
 and violent death is unfortunately too well established.         Two
evenings before he quitted Mocha, he passed some few minutes
with Mr. Aitkins, the surgeon of the Company's Establishment
there, and at the same time confided to the care of Mr. Benzoni,
an Italian, in their service also, the whole of his valuable papers
and journals, which he had congratulated himself on securing
from the grasp of rapacious ignorance, to be forwarded by that
gentleman through Egypt to his distinguished patron the Duke
of Saxe Gotha in Europe. It fell, however, to the lot of poor
Benzoni himself to close a chequered existence on that inhospi
table shore : so that the only manner in which he could acquit
himself of his trust, was to transfer the charge of his murdered
friend's memoranda to the chief of the Banians there, who was
then the commercial broker of the East India Company.            From
him these papers were soon afterwards seized by the Dola, and
are now, it is to be feared, irretrievably      lost to the friends of
science and the patrons of discovery, who would doubtless other- .
wise, have found among their details, information of the most
valuable and interesting nature. — Such has been the melancholy
termination of the labours of one of the most enterprising and
promising of modern travellers, who, like Houghton, Park,
Hornemann, and Roiitgen, has fallen a victim to an ardent
thirst for information, and sacrificed not only all that could ren
                                                                   der

   " M. Proust, in a recent letter to M. Delametherie, demon
strates the inexactitude of several other degrees of oxidation
given by Thenard. Once for all, therefore, let it be understood,
that there are only two degrees, that of oxidule and that of oxide;
that the ashes of the metals are combinations, by adherence,
when fire is employed. With respect to mercury, which is liquid,
trituration effects the same ; and with regard to all of them, the
 acids resolve them into an oxidule or oxide, and into a reduced
metal ; and finally, that amalgamation is evident in those two
bodies, oxidule and oxide.    The true oxidule has always the half
 of the oxygen of the oxide, and the other relations are combi
 nations between those two degrees, of which the former then
 performs the functions of oxide, and the latter the functions of
 acid. The oxide may be hvperoxidated, and it is so almost al

partly in oxidules. When we analyse these compounds               means       by
of reduction, we obtain, naturally, particular appearances of
oxygen, which we then take for proper degrees of oxidation                                   ;
then the hydrates a little intense, the hydrato-oxygenates so
common in the oxides of the metals, and the combinations be

                    STEAM ENGINES IN CORNWALL
    By Messrs. Leans' Report of work done in October 18;15, it
 appears that 34 engines consumed 75,009 bushels of coals; that
 these engines collectively lifted 618,902,532 pounds one foot
 high by a bushel of coals each.; being an average duty of
 18,203,016 pounds lifted one foot with every bushel of coals.
During the same month, according to their Report, Woolf's en
gine at Wheal Var consumed 984 bushels of coals, and lifted
41,572,070 pounds one foot high with each bushel ; and his en
gine at Wheal Abraham consumed 1062 bushels, and lifted with
each bushel 51,443,639 pounds of water one foot high.
         The title at the top of the fourth column of the table of
work done by the engines in Cornwall, given in page 1 1 8 of the
present volume, is incorrectly expressed. It should be read thus :
"  Pounds    of water lifted one foot high, by every number              of
bushels of   coals  equal to the number of the engines."

    Mr. Forster has of late been making some observations on the
heads of insane persons in some public madhouses, with a view
to determine how far the particular organization of the head ap
pears to modify the character of the mania.             He has found in
the majority of cases a very striking connexion, particularly with
regard to the melancholic insane, who have been found to have
the parts of the brain which, according to the new system, pro
duce the sentiment of fear, much developed.              It is to be hoped
that repeated observations        of this  kind   may lead to important
discoveries in the history of this interesting, but at present ob
scure, class of disorders.

 LXXIII.     On the Franklinian Theory of the Leyden.Tar . with
    Remarks on Mr. Donovan's Experiments,           By Mr. Thomas
    Howxdy.
                           To  Mr.  Tilloch.
         I
 Sir, — have      sent you for insertion in the next number of your
 Magazine, a demonstration of some principles of the Franklinian
 theory of the Leyden jar ; with an exposition of the fallacious
 experiments   which Mr. Donovan has opposed to them in his
" Reflections   on the Inadequacy of the principal Hypotheses to
 account for the Phaenomena of Electricity."
    The following extract from the       " Reflections" contains an
account of two experiments made by Mr. Donovan, the results
of which he considers as opposing Franklin's doctrine of accu
mulation and deficiency.        " During the process of charging,
both surfaces (of a jar) ought to manifest their characteristic
properties in proportion as the charging increases.      Whether or
not this is the case, will be seen by the following experiments.
The apparatus employed was an insulated jar, from the stem of
which projected a wire at right angles, and from the outside
coating another, two pith-balls being attached to each by means
of gilt thread.     The jar, perfectly dry, is to be placed on the
insulating stand, and a chain is to be connected with the out
 side, so as to form a communication         with the ground.   The
electric machine being in strong action, is made to pour in a
stream of sparks until the jar be fully charged.      The chain be
ing removed, the balls connected with the inner surface will be
repelled by excited sulphur, and those with the outer surface
will be attracted.    If the inside be now positive, —why are the
balls repelled by sulphur ? And if the outer surface be negative, —
why are its balls attracted?      If the jar be weakly charged, the
results are as described by Franklin; and it was no doubt on such
that this philosopher made his observations.           But were the
doctrine of accumulation and deficiency well founded, the re
sults should be the more decided as the jar is more strongly
charged.     Yet when the hypothesis supposes the jar to contain
the greatest quantity of electricity, it is then that it evinces
symptoms of containing      the least." — Phil. Magagine,  vol. xliv.
 p. 347.
    The apparently contradictory results of the above-described
 experiments very much excited my attention on perusing Mr.
Donovan's     " Reflections;" and I strongly suspected that he had
 been deceived by mere appearances.
    In consequence of this suspicion, I determined to investigate
 Yol. 46. No. 212^ Dec. 1815.                C c                  the

402                On the Franklinian Theory
the electrical states of the surfaces of ajar under the conditions
mentioned by him as necessary to obtain the specified results ;
and at the same time, if I found that they occurred, to ascertain
the cause or circumstances which produced them. Accordingly,
besides a jar with its pith-balls and insulating stand, the fol
lowing additional apparatus was selected for the purpose.        A
smooth glass tube, two sticks of sealing-wax, a pair of pitlw
balls suspended from an insulating stand, a gold-leaf electrome
ter, and a small Leyden jar.
   Before I proceed to describe the experiments, it is proper to
give notice, first, that as the investigation occupied the space of
at least five hours (all the experiments having been several times
repeated), whenever it appeared that the charge of the jar was
sensibly diminished, the machine was put in action till the charge
was restored to its original intensity; — secondly, that the pith-
ball and gold-leaf electrometers were placed in such situations
as to be out of the influence of the charged jar ; — thirdly, that
the balls of the former were kept diverging with negative, and
the leaves of the latter with positive electricity ; — and lastly, that
one of the sticks of sealing-wax was reserved for examining the
balls connected with the inside of the jar (except where it is
otherwise mentioned), while the other was exclusively used for
electrifying the pith -ball electrometer, and examining the balls
connected with the outside of the jar.
    Exp. 1. The inner surface of the jar being connected with
the prime conductor, and the outer with the ground, a very
strong charge was communicated to         it,and the connexion with
the ground removed.        A stick of sealing-wax about an inch in
diameter being strongly excited, was brought suddenly towards
 the balls connected with the inner surface, and they were in
stantly attracted   byit ;  but the wax being kept for a moment
at the same distance, the attraction ceased, and the balls re
turned to their original position.
    Exp. 2. The wax being excited again as before, was brought
 slowly towards the pith-balls   :  the attraction between the wax
 and them was perceptible, though    it   was weak and momentary          ;
 but when the wax was brought nearer, repulsion took place be
 tween it  and the balls, which then kept briskly receding from
 the wax.     The wax being now withdrawn, was presented to
each   of the  electrometers in succession; and by these tests the
 wax was found to be in      positive state of electricity.
                             a                                   .    .
                                                                     ..
    Exp. 3. The positive electricity on the wax being taken off',
it  was again excited negatively, and presented to the balls as in
 Experiment   2,   with the same results ensuing.       After the balls
 had been repelled several times     by  the wax, it   was withdrawn
 and brought suddenly towards the balls connected with the
                                                              outside^

                          of the Leyden Jar.                    403
outside, and these were immediately attracted by it.      On with
drawing the wav, its electrical state was ascertained by presenting
it to the electrometers as before, and found to be positive.
    E.rp. 4. The preceding experiment was repented with this
difference only, that after the wax had repelled the balls con
nected with the inner surface, it was brought, instead of once,
two or three times in succession, towards those connected with
the outer; and the attraction between the wax and the balls de
creased every time the wax was presented to them till it dis
appeared ; and then, on bringing the wax somewhat nearer, re
pulsion took place between it and the balls.        While the wax
attracted the balls connected with the outer surface, the electri
cal state of the wax, on examination, always proved to be posi
tive ; and when it repelled them, its state was always found to
be negative.
    Exp. 5. The glass tube was next excited and presented to
the balls communicating with the inner surface, and they were
repelled by the tube ; and continued to be so in whatever man
ner it was presented to them, and at every distance at which it
could influence them.
    Exp. 6. The second stick of sealing-wax being strongly ex
cited, was brought towards the balls connected with the outer
surface of the jar, and they were vigorously repelled by the
wax ; and continued to be so in whatever manner it was pre
sented to them, and at every distance at which it could influence
them.
    E.rp. 7.   The glass tube was excited strongly and brought
rapidly  towards  the same balls, and they were instantly attracted
by it; the tube was withdrawn, and again .brought towards them
as before ; they were again attracted, but not quite so strongly
as in the first instance.
    Exp. S. The tube was well excited again, and brought slowly
towards the balls : at first they were slightly attracted ; but
when it was advanced, they were slightly repelled ; and when it
was brought still nearer, the balls kept briskly receding from the
tube.    The tube being withdrawn, was presented to each of the
electrometers in succession, and its effects on them proved it to
 be in a negative state of electricity.
    Exp. 9. The negative electrical state of the tube being de
stroyed, it was again excited positively, and presented suddenly
 two or three times in succession to the balls connected with the
 outer surface ; the attraction between the tube and balls was
 diminished every time the tube was presented to them, till it dis
 appeared; and then, on bringing the tube something nearer,
 repulsion took place between it and the balls.     The tube, after
           •                       C e  2                  repelling

404                    On the Franklinlan       Theory
  repelling the balls of the outer surface, was presented to those
  of the inner, which were attracted by it. Whenever the balls of
  the outer surface were attracted by the tube, its electrical state
  was positive ; and whenever they were repelled by               it,   its state
  was found to be negative.
     Exp. 10. At the conclusion of the preceding experiments
  the jar which had been the subject of them was discharged, and
  its outside connected with the ground.              I  then took the small
 jar before mentioned, and brought its ball in contact with the
  prime conductor, its outside being held in the hand                 ;  the ma
  chine was put in action, and       a     strong charge was communicated
  to both the jars.        The communication between the ground and
  the jar whose electrical states were under examination being re
  moved, the ball of the small one was presented to the balls
  connected with the inner surface of the former, and they were
 repelled     bythat of the small one in whatever manner          it    was pre
 sented,   and   at   every   distance   at      it
                                             which    could  influence    them.
     Exp. 11. The ball of the small jar                was  next   brought to
 wards the balls connected with the outer surface                 ;   and these
 were attracted in whatever manner              it   was presented, and at
 every distance at which      it     could influence them.
     Exp.   12.      Both   the  jars having been discharged, that whose
 electrical states were        to  be examined was charged again as in
 Experiment 10; but the small one being held                 by   its ball while
 its outside coating was kept in contact with the prime conductor,
 its inner surface acquired     a     charge which was the reverse of that
 acquired     by the   inner   surface   of the other jar, but of equal in
 tensity  with    it.    After   the  jars had been strongly charged, the
 ball of the small one was presented to the balls connected with
 the inner surface of the other     ;       and they were attracted by     it   in
 whatever manner     it     was presented to them, and at every distance
 at which    it could influence them.
     Exp.   13.     The ball of the small jar was next brought towards
the balls connected with the outer surface            ;    and they were re
 pelled  by   itin whatever manner       it     was presented, and at every
distance at which     it    could influence them. — After both the jars
had been discharged, the larger with its pith-balls, and the in
sulating stand were removed from the positive, and placed at the
negative conductor     ;     the inner surface of the jar being connected
with   it,  while the outer communicated with the ground. And
as the same mode of proceeding was followed in making the
subsequent experiments as had been in the foregoing,                  it  will be
necessary    to    state   their   results   only, which  will  be   found per
fectly accordant with those of the former.                                       :
    Exp. 14. The jar being strongly charged, the balls con-                      ;
                                              ,                           nccted

                          of the Ley den Jar.                     405
netted with its inner surface were examined.          Ah excited glass
tube first attracted, and then repelled them        ; when the latter
 effect was produced, the tube was ascertained to be negative.
    Exp. 15. . An excited stick of sealing-wax, and the small jar
charged negatively, each being separately applied, constantly re
pelled them.
    Exp. 16. The small jar charged positively always attracted
them.
    Exp. 17. The balls connected with the outer surface were
next examined.       The excited tube, and the small jar charged
positively, constantly repelled them.
    Exp. 18. The excited wax first attracted, and then repelled
them ; when the latter effect was produced, the wax was found
to   be positive.
    Exp.   19. The small   jar charged negatively, always attracted
them.
    On reviewing the foregoing series of experiments, it was evi
dent that the object for which they had been undertaken was
fully accomplished ; but it seemed requisite to notice and ac
count for the rapid changes which took place in the excited
electrical states of the stick of sealing-wax and the glass tube
when presented to the surfaces of the jar possessing an electrical
state contrary to their own.     For in performing the experiments
care was always taken to prevent their coming into contact with
the pith-balls, or even approaching nearer to them than was
necessary to produce the intended effect.        Those changes were
clearly occasioned by these two circumstances : — first, the great
intensity of the charge upon the surfaces to which the excited
bodies were presented ; and secondly, the small electrical capa
city of those bodies in relation to that of the surfaces to which
they were opposed.      For when the small jar, whose electrical ca
pacity is so greatly superior to that of either of the excited bodies,
was charged, and presented as they had been to the surface
possessing an opposite electrical state ; the electrical state of
the jar underwent no change of kind, the only effect produced
on it being a very small diminution of intensity in the charge.
Those changes therefore did not arise from any peculiar property
of the jar in modifying or changing the electricity communicated
to its opposite surfaces ; for any simply electrified surfaces whose
capacity and charge are much superior to those of the excited
bodies will produce similar effects, as the following experiments
show. — One extremity of a wire which had a brass ball at its
opposite end, was inserted in the hole at the extremity of the
prime conductor, so as to project horizontally from it ; and two
pith-balls were suspended from the end of the wire that was
furthest from the conductor.       The machine was put in action,
                               C c 3                               and

406                    On the Vranklinian Theory
 and kept so while the experiments were performed.      An excited
                                                  excited wax first
.glass tube always repelled the pith-balls ; but
 attracted and   then  repelled   them ; the wax  when it repelled
 them was found to   be positive.    The prime conductor  was now
 connected with the ground, and the experiments performed at
 the negative conductor.     The excited wax always repelled the
 halls, but the excited tube first attracted and then repelled
 them    the tube when it repelled the balls was found to be ne
          ;
gative.   These experiments beautifully illustrate and confirm
those made with the same bodies on the jar ; and at the same
time demonstrate that the causes assigned for the electrical
changes which occurred in those bodies are the true ones.
                                                          —And
ns the investigation is now completed, it will be proper to state
the conclusions or propositions which appear to lie established
by it.
        That the surface of a Leyden jar which communicates
      1st.
with the conductor of an electrical machine in action, acquires
a charge (however intense that charge may be) of the same kind
of electricity as that of the conductor with which it communi
cates.
     This proposition    is proved   by Experiments 1, 5, 10, 12, 14,
 15, and 16.
   2d. That the surface of the same jar which communicates
with the ground acquires at the same time a charge (h wever
intense it may be) of the contrary kind of electricity to that of
the conductor with which the other surface communicates.
   This proposition is proved by Experiments           (i,   7,
                                                          11, 13, 17,
 IS, and 19.
   3d. That an excited electric by being opposed to a surface
highly charged with the contrary electricity and of greater elec
trical capacity, will rapidly lose its excited electrical state, and
acquire a state similar to that of the electrified surface to which
it   is   opposed.
      This proposition   is  proved by Experiments     2,    3,   4,    14,
                                                                       8,   9,
 18, and     two of those made at the conductors of the machine.
              by
    Now the two former of the above propositions may be re
 duced into one, which may be thus expressed That the opposite
                                                   :
 surfaces of     charged jar, however intense its charge may be,
                   a
 are always in opposite states of electricity.        And as these op
 posite states  are  the   immediate   results of those  laws of electrical
 action  which   the   Franklinian    theory   of the  jar  contemplates         ;
 that theory,  so  far  as it  accounts  for these  opposite states,     by is
 the above-cited experiments fully demonstrated.            It   now time
                                                                  is
 to advert to Mr. Donovan's experiments, in order to point out
 the source of his errors, the negligence with which he examined
 the electrical states of the jar on which he operated, and the
                                                                        futility

futility of his objections to Franklin's theory of charged elec
trics. His first two experiments are simply these : He presented
excited sulphur to the pith-balls connected with the inner
surface of his jar, and observed thr.t they were repelled by
the sulphur ; he then presented the same sulphur to the balls
conuected with the outer surface, and observed that they were
attracted by it.     Now Experiments 2 and 3 of my foregoing
series prove that his sulphur, when it repelled the balls of the
inner surface, was in a positive slate of electricity; and conse
quently, when he presented it to the balls of the outer surface,
attraction was the necessary consequence. And Experiment 4
proves that had he presented the sulphur to the latter balls more
 than twice, he must have discovered that the sulphur after at
tracting would have repelled them. Again, Experiments 1 and 2
prove that the balls of the inner surface were attracted by the
sulphur before they were repelled.          Hence it is proved that in
making    his  first two  experiments,     Mr. Donovan observed only
one half of what he ought to have observed ; and, unfortunately
for him, this was the wrong half : — such was his attention in ma
king them ! Moreover he neglected to employ any additional
means to ascertain the electrical state of either the inner or outer
surface of his jar ! He also neglected to examine the electrical
state of his sulphur after it had repelled the balls of the inner
surface, and likewise after it had attracted those of the outer !
And not in the least suspecting the electrical change that the
sulphur had undergone, but resting perfectly satisfied with his
two fallacious observations, he supposed first that the inside of
his jar was in a negative, when in reality it was in a positive
state of electricity ! secondly, that the outside was in a positive
state, when in reality it was in a negative one ! and lastly, that his
sulphur was in a negative when it really was in a positive state!
The results of his two experiments being, as he imagined, so
discordant with Franklin's theory, he proceeds thus : " The
error does not relate merely to the surface occupied by the
accumulation.       Let the jar with its wires, balls, &c. be set on
the stand as'before, but not connected with the ground.              Let
the jar be charged, and while the cylinder is still turning let the
surfaces be examined: it will be found that excited sulphur re
pels the balls of both the inside and outside." — Here again, neg
lecting all other assistance, Mr. Donovan employs his favourite
but ungrateful and treacherous sulphur, and            is,
                                                      in the same man
ner   as before,   deceived  by  it.    He  however   goes on:    "This
 cannot be explained while    it     supposed   that the outside    then
                                    by is
                                                                 is

 in for in this case

                                                a
sulphur, be presented, aq attraction ought to follow," True and   :

attraction did follow; but Mr. Donovan's attention was not suf
 ficiently alive to observe it.
                                     " When the charging," says he,
"   is discontinued,    another militating phaenomenon occurs : the
balls collapse ; and after touching, again separate, but with a
different power, for they are now attracted by excited sulphur."
 The last clause in the preceding sentence shows that Mr. Do
novan presented the same sulphur to the balls of the outside
 after they had collapsed, that he had the moment before presented
to them while they were evolving positive electricity in conse
 quence of the action of the machine : the sulphur therefore
which had become positive in that experiment attracted the
 balls now, because, the action of the machine having ceased,
they were actually in a negative state in consequence of the
 electricity which had been evolved, and had departed from the
outside during the previous experiment.         But Mr. Donovan, still
unconscious of the errors into which he had been seduced by
placing implicit confidence in the mischievous sulphur, thus pro
 ceeds :
     cc
        Here then are strong instances which oppose the Franklinian
hypothesis : it appears that the supposed excess may evince the
symptoms of a state of diminution without any abstraction hav
ing taken place; and the diminution may appear to be an ex
cess without any addition/'         These truly are singular disco
veries, all made by     Mr.  Donovan and his sulphur ! And as he
terminates with these discoveries his inquiry concerning the elec
trical states of a charged jar, so likewise with them shall termi
nate my examination of that inquiry.          And I shall add only that
if,  at first view,
                  it  should seem that      have entered more into the

Donovan's errors, the circumstances under which his Reflections

LXXIV. An        Account of some Experiments with a large Vol
         taic Battery. By J. G. Children, Esq. F.R.S.*
In    1S0.9 I presented to the Society a short account of some ex
periments performed with a Voltaic battery of unusually large
plates, which has been honoured by publication in the Philoso
phical Transactions for that year. Since that period I have
constructed another of still larger dimensions, the effects of which
form the subject of the present communication.              The copper
and zinc plates of this apparatus are connected together, in the
usual order, by leaden straps ; they are six feet long, by two feet
eight inches broad, each plate presenting 32 square feet of sur
face.    All the plates are attached to a strong wooden frame
suspended by ropes and pulleys, which being balanced by coun
terpoises, is easily lowered and elevated, so as to immerse the
plates in the acid, or raise them out of                 it,
                                                     at pleasure.    The
first trials of the power of this instrument were made in July
 1813, in the presence of several philosophical friends; but the
effects then fell very short of my expectations, arising, as after            I
wards found, from       defect in the construction, which has been
                          a
since remedied, and another copper plate added to each mem
ber of the series, so that every cell now contains one zinc and
two copper plates, and each surface of zinc           opposed. to sur
                                                           is                 a
face of copper.      This was done at the suggestion of Dr. Wol-
laston, and has very considerably increased the power of the
battery.     From some comparative experiments, which              made       I
with a small apparatus, the increase in quantity of electricity,
thus effected,     at least one half.
                     is                   The cells of the battery are
21 in number, and their united capacities amount to 945 gal
lons.    To each pole of the battery a leaden pipe, about 3-4th»
of an inch      diameter,
                in              attached
                                   is             by
                                              solder, and the opposite
end of each pipe immersed in a basin of mercury,               separate (a
basin for each pipe,)        means of which the circuit
                              by                             completed,
                                                                   is
and a perfect contact ensured.          The first experiments       shall     I
mention were made on the comparative facility with which
different metals are ignited when placed in the electrical circuit.
For this purpose, in each experiment, two wires of dissimilar
metals were taken, of equal diameter and length              one end of
                                                                   ;
each was in contact with one of the basins of mercury commu
nicating with the poles of the battery, and the other end bent
to an angle, and the wires connected continuously               hooking by
them together.      The    length  of each wire  was  eight inches,  and
the diameter T'Ttn      or'  an  incn-   The  battery   was  moderately
excited    by a charge of one part acid diluted with 40 parts of
water.

     Exp.    \ .   A platina and a gold wire being thus connected, and
introduced into the electrical circuit, the platina was instantly
ignited, the gold remained unaffected.
     Exp. 2. A similar arrangement of gold and silver wires.
The gold was ignited, the silver not.
 -
     Exp. 3. The- same with gold and copper.            No perceptible
difference in the state of ignition ; both metals were heated red.
     Exp. 4. Gold and iron. The iron was ignited ; the gold
unchanged.
     Exp. 5. Platina and iron. The iron ignited instantly at the
point of contact next the pole of the battery.        Then the platina
became ignited through its whole extent.           After this the iron
became more intensely heated than the platina, and the ignition
of the latter decreased.
     Exp. 6. Platina and zinc. The platina was ignited ; the
zinc was not ; but melted at the point of contact.          In a subse
quent experiment, the zinc did not melt ; but the platina ignited
a* before.
     Exp. 7. Zinc and iron. The iron was ignited; the zinc
bore the heat without fusing. ,
     Exp. 8. Lead and platina.          The lead fused at the point of
 contact.                                                         . ...
   '
     Exp. 9. Tin and platina.          The tin fused at the point of
contact.         No ignition of either wire took place in the two last
experiments.
     Exp.     10.   Zinc and silver.   The zinc was ignited before it
melted     :  the silver was not ignited.
     The results in every case were the same to whichever pole
of the battery either wire was presented. I varied these experi
ments by introducing several alternations of different wires con
tinuously connected into the circuit, and obtained in every in
stance analogous results.         Thus
     Exp. 11. Alternations of platina and silver, three times re
peated : all the platina wires were ignited, and none of the silver.
     Exp. 12. One zinc wire between two platina i both the
platina wires were ignited, the zinc not.
     Exp.           One iron between two platina.       Both the latter
first ignited ;     then  the iron, which   soon became most heated,
and fused.
     It is unnecessary to enter into a further detail of these experi
ments ; it will be sufficient to say generally, that when wires of
several different metals were introduced at once into the circuit,
the order of their ignition was precisely that of the former ex
periments.         In one experiment with copper and gold, the copper
was decidedly most heated.
     I feel some difficulty in attempting an explanation of the pre
                                                                 ceding

                       with a large Voltaic Battery.                   411
  ceding phaenomena, and offer the following conjecture with dif
  fidence.     When a perfect communication is established between
  the poles of the battery, the electricity circulates without pro
  ducing anv visible effect ; but if it meet with resistance in its
  passage, it manifests itself bv chemical action, bv the evolution
  of heat, or both. Tims, if a bar of metal be connected with
  one pole of the battery, and its extremity immersed in a basin
  of mercurv connected with the other pole, at the instant the
  surfaces come in contact, heat and light are evolved, which
  cease as soon as the bar, if it be of sufficient size, is fairly
  plunged beneath the surface of the quicksilver.           If the circuit
  he completed bv two pieces of charcoal, the evolution of heat
  and light is permanent, as long as their surfaces remain in con
  tact, because that contact can never be so perfect as to oppose
  no resistance to the electricity; whereas, in the case of the bar
  of metal and the mercury, it soon becomes complete, and the
  current is then uninterrupted.         Resistance, therefore, appeal's
  to occasion the development of heat (whatever be the ultimate
  cause of the phaenomenon); and as this must be inversely as the
  conducting power, when any two of the wires connected con
  tinuously are placed in the circuit, that which is the worst con
  ductor must be most heated ; and thus platina, having the lowest
  conducting power, is ignited before all the rest ; and silver, which
   conducts best, is not heated red when connected with any of
   the other metals.      Should it be objected, that if the electricity
  meet with greater resistance in one body than in the other, equal
   quantities cannot be transmitted in equal times by the two sub-
'
   stances, (a circumstance essential to electrical action,) 1 answer,
  that a body may be propelled through two media of different
   densities, with equal velocity, if the propelling force- be propor
   tionate to the resistances ; and it is a necessary consequeuce that,
   whatever effect the passage of the body be capable of producing
   in the least resisting medium, it will produce it in a still greater
   degree in the most resisting ; and if that effect be heat, the
  greatest portion will be developed in the latter instance.         In the
   case in question, indeed, there is but      one propelling   force:  but
   as it is sufficient to overcome the greater resistance, the analogy
   is unshaken.      That the ignition of the wire is generally first
   perceptible at the point of contact next the pole of the battery
    (to whichever pole it be presented) is in favour of the hypothesis.
   1 once thought      the phaenomena     might be owing to the joint
   effect of difference  of  conducting power, and inequality           the
   capacity of different metals for heat; but the experiments of
    Crawford, Leslie, Dalton, Irvine, and others, militate against
   that idea; for, according to them, the capacities' of iron and
   platina exceed those of all the other metals, whereas, on the
                                                               supposition

412                An Account of some Experiments
supposition alluded to, they ought to be inferior.          From the
foregoing results, the order of the conducting powers       of the me
tals tried is silver, zinc, gold, copper, iron, and platina.       Tin
and lead fuse so immediately at the point of contact, that they
cannot be placed.          Between gold and copper the difference is
trifling ; and   with   regard to platina and iron, their relations to
each other,   in  this circumstance, seem to be affected by elevation
of temperature.        It may be observed, that the order of the above
metals, as conductors of electricity, nearly follows that of their
powers to conduct heat.
    In an experiment in which equal lengths of two platina wires,
of unequal diameter, (the larger being -jV'h, the smaller ^th of
an inch,) were placed together in the circuit parallel to each
other, the thicker wire was ignited, because it conveyed more
electricity without proportional increase of cooling surface. When
connected continuously,         the order of ignition was reversed.
These two results were foreseen by Dr. Wollaston, who suggested
the experiments.                                                    ,
    The experiments which I now proceed to mention, were made
with the battery in a high state of excitation ; and I consider
them as representing nearly the maximum of effect which it is
capable of producing.          As the quantity of acid was increased
from time to time, and that previously added often almost spent
before fresh was put in, it is not easy to say exactly what pro
portion it bore to the water ; perhaps the largest may be stated
at about -^gth.       On this, as on former occasions, I found a mix
ture of nitrous and sulphuric acids, to produce tha most power
ful and permanent effects.
    Exp. 1. 5 ft. 6 in. of platina wire, -i^g- of an inch in diame
ter, were heated red throughout, visible in full day-light.
    Exp. 2. 8 ft. 6 in, of platina wire,          of an inch in diame
ter, were heated red.
     Exp. 3. A bar of platina I -6th of an inch square, and 2|
inches long, .was also heated red, and fused at the end ; and,
    Exp. 4, a round bar of the same metal, tVo6tt of an inch in
                    j
diameter, and 2 inches in length, was heated bright red through
out.
    Exp. 5. Fine points of boxwood charcoal intensely ignited
in chlorine, neither suffered any change, nor produced any in
the gas. The result was similar when heated in azote.
    I next tried the power of the battery to fuse several refractorv
substances.      The subject of experiment was placed in a small
cavity,  made    in  a piece of well burnt boxwood charcoal, floating
on the surface of the mercury in one of the basins before men
tioned, and the circuit completed by another piece of charcoal,
communicating by stout copper wire, with the other basin.

     Exp.   1.  Oxide of tungsten, which (as well as all the other
 metallic    oxides operated on) had been previously intensely
  ignited in a charcoal crucible, in a powerful furnace, fused, and
 was partially reduced.        The metal grayish white, heavy, bril
 liant, and very brittle.
      Exp. 2. Oxide of tantalum.        A very small portion fused.
 The grains have a reddish-yellow colour, and are extremely
 brittle.
     Exp. 3. Oxide of uranium ; fused, but not reduced.
     Exp. 4. Oxide of titanium ; fused, not reduced.              When
 intensely heated it burnt, throwing off brilliant sparks like iron.
     Exp. 5. Oxide of cerium; fused, and when intensely heated
 it burnt with a large, vivid, white flame, and was partly volati
 lized, but not reduced.       The fused oxide, on exposure for a few
 hours to the air, fell into a light brown powder, containing nu
merous shining particles of a silvery lustre, interspersed amongst
 it, and exhaled an odour similar to that of phosphuretted hy
 drogen.

quite free from small cavities, and weighing 7'1 grains.           The
metal is white, very brilliant, and in its present state its specific
gravity is 18*68, which must be much too low, on account of
the porous state of the globule.        In the minutes of the experi
ments, in July 1813, mention is made of the fusion of a small
portion of pure iridium into a globule weighing TVo °f a gra'n»

     In the vear 179(5, M. Clouet converted iron into steel, by
eementation with the diamond, with the view of confirming the
nature of that substance, and of ascertaining the exact state in
which carbon exists in steel. Clouet had also previously formed
steel by cementation with carbonate of lime.            Mr. Mushet re-.
peated    this  experiment,   using instead  of  the carbonate,  caustic
lime,    and   obtained  also  what  he  considered  to  be cast  steel;

whence he concluded that the carbon necessary to convert th«
iron into steel had not been furnished, as Cfouet supposed, by
decomposition of the carbonic acid, but that it had found its
wav from the ignited gas of the furnace to the iron.     This re
sult occasioned suspicions of the accuracy of the     deductions
from the experiment with the diamond ; and Mr. Mushet ac
cordingly, at the suggestion of the editor of The Philosophical
Magazine, repeated the experiment made at the Polytechnic
School, only keeping out the diamond.   The results (for he made
several experiments) uniformly gave him good cast steel, whence
he concludes that we are still without any satisfactory or con
clusive proof of the steelification of iron solely by means of the
diamond ; and adds that he doubts whether the diamond af
forded even one partiile          carbon to the iron.

both Clouet's and        Mushet's    experiments may be found in
the fifth volume of The Philosophical Magazine                   Sir George
M'Kenzie repeated both Clouet's experiments, and those of
Mr. Mushet, and obtained results confirming the conclusions of
the French chemist.       The labours of this gentleman indeed seem
sufficiently conclusive; but,   if   doubt should remain,
                                      a                          it occurred
to Mr. Pepys, that the battery would afford an experimentum
cruris on the subject     ;  and his ingenuity readily suggested           a
mode of making      it, every way unobjectionable.          He bent wire
                                                                      a
of pure soft iron, so as to form an angle in the middle, in which
part he divided    it longitudinally
                                            by
                                            afine saw.     In the opening
so formed, he placed diamond powder, securing               in its situation
                                                            it
by  two finer wires, laid above and below         it,and kept from shift
ing,  by another small wire, bound firmly and closely round them.
All the wires were of pure soft iron, and the part containing the
diamond powder was enveloped                by
                                            thin leaves of talc. Thus
arranged,     the  apparatus    was  placed in the electrical circuit,
when   it soon became red hot, and was kept so for six minutes.
The ignition was so far from intense, that few who witnessed
the experiment, expected,       I   believe, any decisive result.         On
opening    the  wire, however,    Mr.   Pepys    found   that the   whole  of
the diamond had disappeared            the interior surface of the iron
                                        ;
had fused into numerous cavities, notwithstanding the very mo
derate heat to which      it  had been exposed          and all that part
                                                        ;
which had been in contact with the diamond was converted into
perfect blistered steel.       A portion of      itbeing heated red and
plunged    into water,  became   so  hard  as   to  resist the file, and to
scratch glass.     This  result     conclusive; for as the contact of
                                   is
any carbonaceous substance, except the included diamond, was
effectually guarded against, to that alone can the change pro
duced in the iron be referred.        This experiment will also pro-

                      with  a large Voltaic Battery.                415
bably be deemed fatal to the opinion of those mineralogists (if
any do still maintain that opinion) who class the diamond with
substances of the siliceous genus.
    When dry caustic potash was exposed to the intense heat be
tween the two pieces of charcoal, it fused, and appeared. to de
compose, throwing off a large flame of the peculiar purple-rad
colour that attends the combustion of potassium.            When moist
caustic potash was placed in the circuit, the water only was de
composed.
    I endeavoured to ascertain if there be any difference in the
degree of heat produced at either pole of the battery, by placing
two small earthen-ware cups, each containing an equal weight
of mercury, in the circuit, and connected together by a platina
wire of such size and length as to be kept constantly ignited.
The mercury in the cup connected with the zinc end of the bat
 tery, attained in 20 minutes the temperature of 121°; that in
 the other cup 1 123. .
    The battery, even in its most active state, communicated n«
charge to the Ley den phial.
    I give the following experiment, the last with which I shall
occupy the time of the Society, without comment.             I separated
all the zinc from the copper plates, by dividing the leaden straps
that united them ; and then by means of other leaden straps, I
connected all the zinc plates together as one plate, and all the
copper plates in the same manner ; thus reducing the whole bat
 tery to only two plates, each presenting a surface of 1344 square
feet, reckoning the copper surface as only equal to the zinc
When the plates, thus arranged, were suspended, (mite out of
 contact with the acid, a communication was made between the
 two metallic surfaces by means of a platina wire TCVyndth of a:i
 inch diameter, and about -^th of an inch long, with every possi
 ble attention to ensure a perfect contact ; but, although the ex -
 periment was made in the dark, not the slightest appearance of
 ignition was perceptible in the minute wire by which these' ex
 tensive surfaces were connected.         It is known, I believe, to al
 most every member of this Society, that Dr. Wollaston has
 shown, with the delicate apparatus invented by him, that a pla
 tina wire, of the same dimensions as that just mentioned, is in
 stantly ignited by a single pair of plates one inch square, on
 being immersed in a diluted acid.          The ratio of the areas of the
 plates  of  the  respective  batteries  is  as 1 to 48384.    When the
 plates  of the  large battery,  in  the    usual order of arrangement,
  were immersed in mere pump water, previous to any acid having
  been put into the cells, they ignited jth of an inch of platina
  wire Tartn °f an 'nca diameter, and fused the end of it into a
  perfect globule,

                                           To       Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,—          The
                 particles of elastic fluids are generally supposed to
 repel each other : and from the manner in which the first prin
 ciples of pneumatics are investigated, it would appear that this
 property is necessary to the existence of an elastic fluid.        If we
 admit that it          is,
                     we must also admit that the same particles may
 at one time attract, and at another time repel each other.
 For the particles of water attract each other, and when water
    converted into steam its properties are not altered        but steam
 is is
                                                                                     ;
    an elastic fluid, therefore the particles must have been sepa
rated beyond their sphere of attraction, and must have got within:
 a sphere of repulsion.         How distance alone can change tha
properties of matter we are at        loss to conceive.  a
    Let us endeavour to explain the phaenomena on other princi
ples.    Heat and water combine with each other in a constant
proportion under the same atmospheric pressure; but in this
 stale    can hardly be called an elastic fluid, because on being
               it
pressed the heat        expelled, and part of
                               is                  becomes water      butit                   ;
if     can instantly regain the quantity of heat expelled,
          it                                                                                  it   is
elastic; and this elasticity       owing to the strong tendency of
                                                    is
heat and water to combine, when a certain proportion of heat.
               this proportion varies as the pressure.      When steam-
a is is
    present         :
    compressed, hea|       given out; and
                                     is            not compressed into
                                                                    it   is
   less space, as the advocates for the repulsive system suppose                                   it
to be.
    In your paper on Elasticity (Phil. Mag. vol.
                                                         xxii.) you say
that attraction and heat are the causes of elasticity: but all the
phaenomena may vbe exhibited without the assistance of heat:
for instance, immerse        sponge in water, press
                                      a                     and remove          it
the pressure,            elastic, and attraction and form are the
                         it    is
causes.
    I have not, hitherto, seen any experiments to prove the ex
istence of repulsion, that do not admit of        satisfactory explana
                                                                     a
tion from attraction only, and we never ought to admit of more
causes than are sufficient to account for the effects.

                                 To   Mr.      Tilloch.
Sir, — Previous          to the admission of a fact which is a re*
markabie exception to a known law of nature, it ought to be
established by the most direct and decisive experiments ; and it
ought to serve some Important purpose in the (Economy of na
ture which could not he accomplished by any other means ;
otherwise, such a deviation from a general law would not be
consistent with the dignity of an infinitely wise Creator.                  /
    It appears to be a general law of nature, that all bodies are
expanded by heat : water, at low temperatures, is said to be an
exception: the following are supposed to be the phaenomena.
   When heat is added to water ice-cold or at 32°, the water
contracts, and continues to contract as heat is added till its tem
perature is increased to 41J: then, without any perceptible alte
ration in its properties, the water begins to expand, and increases
in volume with every subsequent addition of heat.
    Mr. Dalton, after a long train of experiments, was led to be
lieve that he, and his predecessors in the same field of investiga
tion, had fallen into a mistake with regard to the contraction of
water by heat, in consequence of under-rating the effect which
the change in the capacity of the apparatus employed must oc
casion in the apparent volume of the fluid.
    To remove this objection, to which all the preceding ex
periments were liable, Dr. Hope made a new set of experiments;
in which, we think, there is more confidence placed than the
nature of the experiments entitles them to.           The principle on
which these experiments were made,                        is,
                                                   that when       fluid    a         is
partiallv dilated   or  condensed  the  equilibrium      destroyed, and
                                                                  is
the fluid put in motion      :consequently,      the surface
                                                       if     of ice-cold
water when heated descends,          shows that heat condenses water,
                                          it
and proves the existence of the anomaly, and the reverse                         if   it
does not descend.
    It must be obvious that the manner in which the heat com                is
municated will make      a   very great difference in the results.       In
the first of Dr. Hope's experiments            (Phil. Mag. vol. xxiii.
p. 153),    aglass jar was used:      was placed upon
                                          it                table, witha              a
considerable thickness of matter of little conducting power be
tween  it and the table. Now the worst solid conductor will com
municate heat much better than a fluid            and glass, interposed
                                                          ;
between   two   fluids,  transmits heat very slowly till     acquires the

of the heat would be communicated from the bottom, for tlie>
top of the fluid would condense the stratum of air in contact
with it   :but we do not suppose it would continue to obtain heat
from the air, at least it would be at a very slow rate.      Also it is
evident, that the lower part of the water must require a consi
derable degree of expansion to enable it to overcome the co
hesion and inertia of the part above ; and the expansion at low
temperatures being very small, it is probable that it would re
quire several degrees of heat to put it in motion.        The motion
once begun, a less quantity of heat would continue it ; also the
expansion would be more as the temperature increased.            In this
manner the results of the first experiment may be accounted for,
without supposing the water to contract with the addition of heat.
    In the second experiment we are not certain that any motion
took place till the upper thermometer sunk to 36°; and what
ever care might be taken to keep the surrounding fluid at an
 equal temperature, near the surface, that part of it under the
jar. woidd acquire a temperature sufficient to cause the lower
thermometer to become stationary, till the upper part of the water
became dense enough to overcome the resistance and descend.
     In the third experiment, motion would speedily take place :
 but it appears that when the difference between the top and bot
 tom temperatures was only one degree, the motion ceased ; and
 here we meet with a fact which in some measure proves the cor
 rectness of our explanation ; that     is,
                                         the fluid in the axis at the
 top was at 34°, at the same time that part of the fluid, we suppose
 at about half the height of the jar, was freezing. Why did             it
 not ascend, and let the warmer portion take its place      ?
     Without some difference in specific gravity, we must say that
 motion could not take place. Now        itappears clearly that there
 was no motion in the water during the fourth experiment            ;for,
 when both the thermometers were at 36°,          apart   of  the  water
 must have been at 32° had there been any motion, either the
                          :
 upper or lower thermometer must have been at 32°, or nearly
 so.    The jar was placed in   apan, we suppose without any thing
 between      and the bottom of the pan: — the pan would be sup
              by it
 ported       something that would conduct heat       ; and in conse
 quence    of this arrangement,  that  part  of the   water  round the
 lower thermometer would be receiving heat from the bottom of
 the jar  ; which will account for its not being cooled at quicker
                                                                a
 rate than the top one.
      The fifth experiment was made with        a taller jar, and the
 heat applied at the middle    :   itwould have been interesting to
  have known the temperature in the axis of the jar, at the height
  where the heat was applied.
      This experiment, in common with the others, tends to prove
                                                                    that,

that, at low temperatures,    a difference of several degrees is ne
cessary  to  produce  motion  in the fluid. The evaporation of the!
warm water, and of the surface of that in the jar, would tend to
Cool the top of the fluid at a quicker rate than it could be sup
plied from the middle, till the motion had become accelerated J
when the supply from the middle would exceed the expenditure,
arid consequently the temperature at the top would increase.
    The sixth experiment only proves that, the thermometers being
20 incites distant from each other, and the upper part of the
water at 33°, the lower part might be heated to 39° without
causing motion in the fluid ; for that there was no motion is
evident, because when the upper thermometer was at 36*5° the
water was freezing at the middle of the height of the jar.
    Dr. Hope seems to have been aware that part of the facts
iftight be accounted for by the effects of the cohesion and inertia
of the water. The fourth experiment led him to believe that these;
forces had little effect.    But that an imperceptible change of
density should overcome the effoets of cohesion and inertia, ap
pears as much an aliornalv as the expansion of water by cooling;
ibf'the direct cohesion of a square inch of water is riot less than
40' grains' troy: add to this the effect of inertia, and it will not
appear surprising that the small increase of bulk which water
under 40° acquires by increasing its temperature 6*, should be
 necessary to put in motion.
    Had Dr. Hope used three thermometers in the two last ex
periments,       Would have thrown some additional light on the
               it'
subject  :  at present we have many reasons for doubting the fact,
that water    is condensed     the addition of heat.

cipitate of super tartrate of potass.   Sulphate of potass, on ac
count of its sparing solubility, would be precipitated on a slight
addition of acid, were it not capable of combining with an excess
of acid and being rendered by it a super and more soluble salt :
this then requires a much larger proportion of acid to deliqui-
date it than a salt of the same solubility as the neutral sulphate,
and which is not capable of combining with an extra dose of
acid.     But other and more important facts presented them
selves to my notice, which do not appear to have received that
attention by chemists which their importance in the science re
quires.     Students naturally conceive that the bases of soluble
salts are soluble in the acids which form these combinations —
this very extensive error may include the whole class of salts ;
but as in this I allude to acids of the usual specific gravity, it is
alone the permanent and efflorescent salts which are precipitated
by them.
    Some observations in your valuable Magazine, on the subject
of barytes and strontian, by Mr. Hume, somewhat lessened the
difficulties to which the student is subject: but whether that
gentleman knew that these properties were not peculiar to those
earths, I am entirely ignorant.       Berthollet hinted in a more
general way that such properties do exist, when he stated, that
by increasing the points of contact of the salt precipitated from
the solution of sulphate of potass by sulphuric acid, it may be
redissolved : this solution however cannot be obtained without
exposure of the mixture to the atmosphere (from which it ab
sorbs moisture) by an increase of temperature, or perhaps by
some other circumstance, which, if it be the case, ought to have
been explained.

    Metallic salts are also subject to similar changes. We see
then, that salts in general, alkaline, earthy, and metallic, partake
with barytes of the property of being precipitated under similar
circumstances by their respective acids; — and generally, accord
ing to the greater or       less solubility of salts in water, they are
precipitated by their acids more or less concentrated.
    Had the facts here contained been generally known, the au
thors of chemical rudiments must necessarily incur great censure,
for plunging deeper into mystery, that which is already intri
cate : it must have involved many novices in the science into
the greatest difficulties ; for their first attempts are generally to
form the salts, and in performing which, if instead of solution
they obtain a precipitate, thev conclude that the experiment by
some unknown accident has failed, — they refer to the instructions
and repeat the experiments in vain ; and this they are subject to,
not only in the formation of alkaline and earthy salts, for ma-
 tallic salts, as we have seen, are included in the common error.
What can be a greater discouragement ? — But long after, when
least expected, they by some fortunate accident obtain by means
of a dilute acid the earnestly sought-for solution ; this event
 steals on them, not as a discovery, for they charge it to their
 own ignorance rather than the instructor's neglect.        Water then,
 when required to the effect, should be expressed, as it cannot
be supposed that one who is ignorant of its properties can un
 derstand that it should in this case be present, when in many
 experiments its absence to a certain degree is absolutely neces
 sary.
    Rudiments should be such, that the inexperienced learner
 should obtain by them a competent knowledge of those laws
 by which the more abstruse parts of a science should become
 less difficult, as he has been more arduous in imbibing the means
 of  success.
    Under these circumstances, I cannot forbear to advise the
 authors of chemical rudiments, to explain more clearly that it is
 the acid which unites with the base, and the water alone which
 dissolves this combination.

  LXXV1II. Experiments in Voltaic Electricity.             By Andrew

                              To Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir, — Having        seen a statement    in your Magazine for August,
  that  M. Dobereiner of Jena subjected mercury in contact with
                                    D d3                          water

water to the Voltaic action, and obtained at the negative pole,
where the mercury was placed, an amalgam of that metal and
hydrogen, which was not given off in the form of gas; I thought
it worth while to repeat the experiment, which I have varied in
every possible way, and of which the following is an accurate
account, — if you think it worth while to make room for it among
the more important communications you are in the habit of re
ceiving.     Having let fall a globule of pure mercury of about
twice the size of a pea into a watch-glass of common spring
water, I plunged two platina wires, proceeding from each end of
 a Voltaic trough, into the water, neither of them touching the
 globule, but removed to the opposite extremities of the glass. —
 Oxygen arid hydrogen were given out by each as usual, the mer
 cury remaining unaltered ; the wires being brought nearer, the
 mercury lost its globular form, extending itself in an oval shape,
 much flattened, appearing equally attracted by each wire.              The
 wires being both made to touch the globule and drawn back
 again, the mercury adhered to the negative.             In this situation,
 .the positive wire not touching the metal, no hydrogen gas was
 .given out by the negative, or so small a quantity that it required
.very minute inspection to detect it : the mercury appeared of less
  specific gravity, more fluid and brilliant than before ; whilst the
 positive wire separated a copious stream of oxygen.              In two or
  three minutes some bubbles of hydrogen began to arise, but in
  small quantity.
     If the positive wire is brought within a small distance of the
  mercury when connected with the negative, a great portion of
  the oxygen passes over the snrfaee of the globule and of the
  water in a rapid current towards the negative wire ; and on
  bringing it almost in contact, the mercury Ls attracted by                 it,
 touches it, and immediately shrinks from it, assuming the form
  of  a  cone, and again expanding so as to touch the wire             a se,-
  cond time, continuing this motion or rather pulsation for some
  time.    When the trough       isfirst charged, this motion     is incon
  ceivably rapid, and has continued with       a   single two-inch trough
  of 50 plates for two hours or more.          The negative wire will be
  found coated with mercury on being removed.               If the positive
  wire     plunged into the globule (the negative not touching it),
          is
  and even drawn out of          it
                                  immediately,     it becomes fixed    in    a
  moment, losing      its brilliancy and fluidity, depositing      a  black
  oxide at first, and after some hours     a   beautiful lemon-coloured
  oxide   ; but     does not become less fluid after remaining
                    it                                                       in

 copious stream of hydrogen.         Examined by the microscope, a
  metallic crystallization appears to shoot over the surface of the
 metal accompanied with prismatic colour.          Heat tends to make
 the globule less fluid, by evaporating the mercury and leaving
 the oxide.     Having evaporated the water from a globule ex
 posed to the Voltaic action for 16 hours, the glass being much
 heated, a series of small explosions accompanied with corusca
 tions of fire appeared to take place from the residuum surround
 ing the mercury ; but as I have failed in reproducing this effect
 by the same means, it is not impossible to have been an ocular
 deception.     On touching with the negative wire the globule
 after it has been oxided by the positive, the oxide falls off in
 scales, and the metal quickly reappears in its pristine brilliancy
and fluidity, a portion of oxide passing to the negative pole, and
 no hydrogen gas given off, being absorbed by the globule— so
 that it is easy to fix or make fluid the metal, which is best
done by separate watch-glasses connected with each other by a
conducting substance— the positive globule will be fixed, the
negative fluid, and by reversing the glasses, both will be changed.
 If the mercury has remained in contact with the negative wire
 some time, and the positive is withdrawn so as to break the
connexion with the poles, the metal contracts and expands for
some seconds, as if to get rid of the hydrogen gas.           The mer
cury   cannot   be set in  motion  after  having  been  connected with
the negative for several minutes, until, having been first touched
by the positive, it is put in contact with the negative.          These
effects take place when the globule is subjected to the action of a
small trough charged with common water, but in a much less
degree.      If the globule is very small, gas is given out by the
wire in contact with it, as well as by the other.        If the water is
warmed bv a lamp during the action of the wires on the mer
cury, gas is more copiously liberated from both, and the oxide
instead of being dark is of a lemon colour ; but when the water
boils, the oxide is dissolved, the mercury is rendered clear, and
cannot be fixed ; nor has the negative any attraction for           nor
                                                                   it,

         it                         An intercepted stream put the
globule in most violent motion between the wires.            No gas waa

   interrupted; but when broken         by Lane's electrometer, gas was
    given   out by  both  wires,  accompanied with a torrent of small
   sparks, and a cloud of oxide rising between the positive wire and
    the globule.      This current of electricity, when not intercepted,
    had power to tinge litmus paper red and turmeric paper brown
    at the respective positive and negative wires — a few turns of the
    winch made this visible.         The above-mentioned effects took
    place when the globule was subjected to the Voltaic action un
    der double distilled rain-water, but in a much less degree, as the
    pure water was with difficulty deromposaLle with a hundred
    four-inch plates highly charged.         This appeared to arise from
    its being so imperfect a conductor in consequence of being freed
     from acid : indeed, a successive minute stream of sparks attended
     with an electrical snapping, took place from one wire to the
     other, and not much gas was discernible from either ; but the
     moment a drop of acid was let fall into the water, the snapping
     ceased, and gas was most copiouslv disengaged from both wires.
     No motion could be given to the noercifPy, until the water was
     slightly acidified.   If  the sulphuric, nitric, or solution of citrio
     acid are added to the distilled water in any quantity, the gas is
     abundantly increased; but the mercury is not easily fixed nor set
    in motion as with common water, and the surface when jn con-*
    tact with the negative wire is covered with bubbles of hydrogen
    rising from every part of the globule.      Under water impregnated
     with carbonic acid gas or acetic ac id much the same effects take
     place as under common water, except that more gas is liberated;
     but with the acetic acid less gas is liberated than with the car^
     bonic acid, and the globule is not so easily fixable.       When the
    pure water was acidified with cither the muriatic or oxalic acids,
     a most singular effect took place on connecting the globule with
     the positive wire — it lost all fluidity in a moment, and could be
     drawn out in very long fibres as small as the finest hair — with
     the muriatic acid the mercury in contact with the positive be
     came partially coated with a very beautiful deep-blue coat, oc->
     casionally mixed with a fine orange-coloured            oxide ; when
     touched by the negative the coloured scales fell off in a moment,
     and the metal appeared perfectly brilliants— the oxalic acid pro^
     duced no colour. . This is a beautiful experiment.         Under so
     lution of boracic acid in alcohol, the mercury was not so friable
     nor capable of being set in motion as under water.          A singular
     smell was emitted when the trough was highly charged.            With
     all these acids gas was liberated by both wires, whether in con
     tact with the globule of mercury or not.           When the piatina
     wires are plunged in liquid ammonia, and held even an inch
     asunder, the most violent motion is communicated to the glo-r
                                                                      bule4

bule, and a great quantity of gas arises from both wires — in con
tact with the positive, it is fixed and oxided in a moment — in
contact with the negative the metal first resumes its former bril
liancy and fluidity, then appears more fluid and brilliant ; lastly,
it begins to swell and become dull, gradually increasing in size
till it becomes more iknn ten times its original bulk. In this
state it appears like a spongy light metallic mass, covered with
protuberances, of very irregular shape, being a complete amal
gam of mercury and ammonia.                When the connexion is broken
by removing the positive wire from the ammonia, a vast quan
tity of hydrogen gas is liberated by the amalgam, and the mer
cury gradually returns to its former state. When solution of
pure soda or potash is made use of, nearly the same appearances
occur as with the ammonia, excepting the swelling of the mer
cury.    Under lime-water it is fixed and oxided slowly, when in
contact with the positive, but appeared evidently inclined to
form an amalgam ; when touching the negative, a quantity of gas
arose from both wires.
    Under alcohol or ether the same appearances were visible as
under distilled water ; (he quantity of gas was increased if the
spirit was heated or fired; no change takes place in the globule
under naphtha unless the mercury is ignited bv the Voltaic stream,
in which case a great deposit of charcoal is visible on the ne
gative side.      Under ether holding phosphorus in solution, the
positive    wire   in contact with the mercury causes it to lose its
fluidity  and   be   oxided rapidly ; and it is so much flattened that
it covers four times the surface it occupied before, extending
itself in a singular manner in every direction from the positive
wire, till it ceases to touch        it,

very little under olive oil holding sulphur in solution, the mer
cury being slowly fixed            the positive wire, but no perceptible
                                    by
gas given out         byeither wire.
    From the foregoing experiments            I venture to draw the fol
lowing    conclusions:      That   the    change   in the mercury from a
fluid to   a more solid substance when in contact with the positive
pole  is   simply occasioned             by
                                         the metal being oxided, which
 oxygen unites with the hydrogen from the negative wire when
 touching      it,
                 and restores       to its fluidity.
                                    it                 That thisis   proved
 by its being difficult or impossible to fix the mercury under            a
 fluid which has power rapidly to dissolve the oxide formed.
 That phosphorus and sulphur are still simple substances, and
 have no metallic base         that carbon has never been metallized,

.   LXXIX.       On the Action of Acids on the Salts usually called
       Hyperoxymuriates, and on the Gases produced from them.
       By Sir Humphry Davy,             LL.D. F.R.S.*
   The      effects produced when concentrated hydro-sulphuric acid
    (oil of vitriol) is poured upon hyperoxymuriate of potassa, have
   been often objects of chemical discussion ; tWe acid and the salt,
   it is well known, become deep orange, and if any moisture is
                               '
   present, or if heat is applied to the mixture, a detonation oc
   curs.     In a paper read before the Royal Society, I have ventured
   to suppose that these phaenomcna depend upon the development
   and sudden decomposition of the compound of chlorine and oxy
   gen, which I. have named euchlorine.
      A statement, which I understand            has been made by      M.  Gay
   Lussac, namely, that a peculiar acid, which he has. called chloric
   acid, may be procured from the hyperoxymuriate of baryta by
   sulphuric acid, le'd me to examine the action of acids on the hy
  peroxymuriates under new circumstances, and I have made some
  observations which appear to me not unworthy of being com
   municated to the Royal Society.
      If 30 or 40 parts of sulphuric acid be poured upon one part
  of dry hyperoxymuriate of potassa in a wine-glass, and the salt
  be agitated in the acid, there is a very slight effervescence only,
  the acid becomes of a deep orange tint, and white fumes, mixed
  with orange fumes, fill the upper part of the glass, which have
  a very peculiar and not a disagreeable smell.
      The slight effervescence taking place in this process, induced
  me to suppose that the substance which coloured the acid must
  contain a larger proportion of oxygen than euchlorine ; for I
  have shown, in a work published in lS12f, that hyperoxy
  muriate of potassa contains six proportions of oxygen ; and by-
  its decomposition 2'5 volumes of oxygen ought to be evolved for
  every volume of chlorine ; and euchlorine procured from the
  hyperoxymuriate of potassa by solution of muriatic acid, yields
  pnly one volume of oxygen, and two volumes of chlorine.

          om  the Sails usually called Hyperoxymuriales,     &c.   427
      1  endeavoured to procure the substance which coloured the
 sulphuric acid during its action upon hyperoxymuriate of potassa,
 and after several failures, in which explosions took place, J at
 length succeeded in the following manner.           Dry oxymuriate of
 potassa in powder was mixed with a small quantity of sulphuric
 acid, and they were rubbed together with a spatula of platinum
 till they had incorporated, and formed a solid mass of a bright
 orange colour.         This mass was introduced into a small retort
 of glass, and exposed to the heat of water which was gradually
 warmed ; a bright yellowish green, elastic fluid arose from tlie
 mixture, which was rapidly absorbed by water, giving to it its
 own tint, but which had no sensible action on mercury.
      To make this experiment without danger, not more than 50
 or 60 grains of the hyperoxymuriate should be employed, great
 care should be taken to prevent any combustible matter from
 being present, and the water should not be permitted to attain
 a temperature equal to 212°, which may be easily managed by
 mixing it with alcohol.         There are dense white fumes when the
 mixture is first made, but there seems to be no heat produced ;
 a small quantity of the orange gas is disengaged at this time ;
 but the greater part of it remains attached to the sulphuric acid
 in the solid mass, and is expelled from it by the heat.
      The gas procured by this process over mercury, when com
 pared with the gas procured from the hyperoxymuriate, by liquid
 muriatic acidfis found to have a much more brilliant colour, is
 much more rapidly absorbed by water, has a peculiar and much
 more aromatic smell, unmixed with any smell of chlorine.             It
 destroys      moist   vegetable  blues  without  previously reddening
 them.        When it is heated to a temperature about that of boiling
 water, it explodes with more violence than euchlorine, and greater
 expansion of volume, producing much light.            After the explo
 sion over mercury, rather less than three (from 2'7 to 2-9) vo
 lumes appear for two of the gas decomposed, and of these, two
 are oxygen, and the remainder chlorine.
       A little chlorine is always absorbed by the mercury during the
 explosion of the gas ; and it appears reasonable to conclude, that
 the deep yellow gas is in reality composed of two in volume of
  oxygen, and one of chlorine, condensed into the space of two
 volumes, and that it consists in weight, of one proportion of
  chlorine 67, and four of oxygen 60.
       None of the combustible bodies which I have tried, decom
  pose this gas at common temperatures, except phosphorus ; this
  when introduced into it occasions an explosion, and burns in
  the liberated gases with great brilliancy.                           ,
       Ite saturated solution in water is of   a deep yelkiw colour, it
  does not taste sour, but is extremely astringent and corroding ;

428                   On the Action   of the Acids
when applied to the tongue, it leaves for a long while a very dis
agreeable sensation.
   It occurred to me that the gas procured from the hyperoxy-
muriate by the action of liquid muriatic acid, might be a mere
mixture of this gas and chlorine ) and two in volume of this
gas and three in volume of chlorine, would produce by explosion
the same products as euchlorine.       The only fact which 1 am ac
quainted with, opposed to the idea, is the circumstance of Dutch
foil not burning .spontaneously in the gas from muriatic acid,
which might be expected if it contained as much as 3-5ths of
uncoinbined chlorine ; though the force of this argument is
suspended, till it is supported by an experiment showing that
Dutch foil inflames in a mixture of two of the deep-yellow gas,
and three of chlorine.       I have not yet been able to procure at
Rome, metallic foil fitted for this experiment.
    I have ascertained that the gas from hyper-oxymuriate and
muriatic acid, though it acts much more slowly upon water than
the other gas, yet in the end gives it the same tint and proper
ties ; and when much of it is exposed to a small quantity of
water, it always leaves a residuum of chlorine, so that if it be
not a mixture, but a compound, the new gas is formed from
it by the action of water.
   The action of hydro-nitric acid on the hyper-oxymuriate,
affords the same gas as that produced by the action of sulphuric
acid, and' a much larger quantity of nitric acid may be safely
made to act on the salt ; but as the gas must be procured by so
lution of the salt, it is always mixed with about l-5th of oxvgen.
    From the solid mixture made with sulphuric acid, I have ob
tained a gas containing only .gV of oxygen ; the fifth proportion
obtained in the experiments with nitric acid, being evolved du-'
ring the time the mixtures were made.
    The saturated solution of the gas affords white fumes, si
milar to those produced at the moment the hydro-sulphuric
mixture is made, from which it is probable, that these fumes
consist of a hydrate of the gas.
    The saturated solution, when mixed with solution of fixed al
kalies, or of ammonia, does not immediately lose its colour, nor
neutralise the alkalies ; but after some time the effect is pro
duced, and hyper-oxymuriates         are obtained   (probably mixed
with a minute quantity of muriates).         The solution exposed to
air, or suffered to remain in close vessels, becomes soon colour
less ; and I am inclined to believe that this depends upon a de
composition of water, for some of it exposed to a small quantity
of air rather increased its volume.
    I shall not propose to give any name to this substance, till
it is determined whether euchlorine is a mixture or a definite
                                                          compound.

compound, and I hope soon to have the means of making a de
cisive experiment on this subject.
    It appears that this new substance, though it contains four
proportions of oxygen, is not an acid ; and hence it is probable,
that the acid fluid compound of oxygen, chlorine, and water,
which M. Gay Lussac calls chloric acid, owes its acid powers to
combined hydrogen, and that it is analogous to the other hyper-
oxymuriates, which are triple compounds of inflammable bases,
chlorine, and oxygen, in which the base and the chlorine deter
mine the character of the compound.             Muriate of potassa
(potassane) is a perfectly neutral  body;  and when  six proportions
of oxygen are added to              it,
                                   still remains neutral.
                                             it             Muriatic
acid (chlorine and hydrogen)         strong acid
                                             is
                                             a     and according to
                                                                ;
the relation above stated,    ought not to lose its acid powers
                                   it                                                 by
the addition of six proportions of oxygen.       Till a pure combi
nation of chlorine and oxygen       obtained, possessed of acid pro
                                              is
perties, we have no right to say that chlorine            capable of  is
being acidified    by
                    oxygen, and that an acid compound exists in
the hyperoxymuriates.      We know that chlorine          capable of
being converted into an acid                 by
                                    hydrogen, and, as      mentioned  I is
in my last paper, where this principle exists its energies ought
not to be overlooked; and all the new facts confirm an opinion
which have more than once before submitted to the considera
      I
tion of the Society, namely, that acidity does not depend upon
any peculiar elementary substance, but upon ptculiar combina
 tions of various substances.

                                             Note.
   Since my return to England,      Ihave made some further investigations on
oxyiodine, on the oxyiodes, and on the deep yellow gas.        The portable ap
paratus    which
               I    employed    in Italy, enabled  me  to  operate only on very
minute quantities of oxyiodine;        have lately made my experiments on a
                                         1
larger scale.
    Thirteen grajns of oxyiodine decomposed         heat, afforded
                                                          by          25 cubical
                                                                             9
inches of oxygen: and 48 grains of oxypotassame or oxyiode of potassium
yielded when decomposed            heat 31 cubical inches of oxygen gas: and
                                   by
SO grains of potassame     or iode of potassium       portion of fhe salt so de
                                                           (a
composed) afforded        treatment with nitric acid 17'8 grains of dry nitre.
                         by
These results give the number 216 as the number representing iodine, and
prove that oxyiodine consists of one proportion of iodine and five of oxy
gen; and that the oxyiodes contain six proportions of oxygen.
    The deep-yellow gas when mixed with chlorine in the proportion of to          2
3,  or even of 2  to2,  deprives      of the power of acting upon Dutch foil,
                                        it
though one of chlorine when mixed with two of common air still burns
this substance.     Hence      appears probable, that the deep-coloured eas
                              it
and chlorine have a chemical action on each other, and that euchlorine                 is
 riot a simple mixture of them.         hope soon to be able to present to the
                                        I

        LXXX.         New   Outlines   of Chemical Philosopfiy.
                 By Ez. Walker, Esq. of Lynn, Norfolk,
                          [Continued  from p. 331.]
From       that ceconomy which we observe in every part of the'
creation, it is reasonable to suppose that some general law ob
tains, in most of the phaenomena which appear upon the surface
of our globe, and in the atmosphere that surrounds it. The
rising vapour, the falling rain, the vivid lightning, arid the roll
ing thunder, are governed by the same laws that rule all the
living functions of plants and animals.
     Now the earth contains two elements, whose joint action ori
matter causes all those various effects which engage the atten
tion' of the chemical philosopher.
    An element is an active power which is invisible, imponde
rable, and untangible, and of which wc know nothing, but from
the effects which it produces on matter; gravity, magnetism,
 and electricity, are not the effects of any known cause, and
 therefore they may be called elements.
    The imponderable element of hydrogen gas of Lavoisier, the
phlogiston of Scheele and Priestley, and the negative electricity
 of Franklin, are only different names for the same element*
     And the fire-air of Scheele, the dephlogisticated air of Priest-
 lev, and the oxygen gas of Lavoisier, are only different names
 for the same gas, the elementary part of which is the same as
 the positive electricity of Franklin.
     When a Leyden phial is discharged through the air, a spark
 is elicited producing both light and heat. This well-known ex
 periment seems to establish beyond the reach of doubt, that
 this effect is produced by the two elements of combustion ; po
 sitive electricity being the element of heat, and negative electri
 city that of light.
     Whence it must evidently appear, that heat and light are not
 elements, but the effects of the two elements of combustion,
 which exist together in the earth and in all other bodies upon its
 surface.        These elements, when thus united in matter, coun
 teract each other, but can be made evident to the senses by
 several well-known methods.           Now fire being produced by fric
 tion, collision, percussion, &c; it Was supposed that fire existed
         f
  in bodies in a fixed state, and was, therefore, called caloric or
 fixed       re.   This hypothesis seems to have arisen from the true
  theory of combustion being then unknown.
     Light and heat are two separate and distinct bodies ; for we
  have light without heat, and heat without light.         Animal heat

                    On the Electricity   of the Earth.
    It is well known to every electrician, that the electrical ma
chine acts much more powerfully at one time than at another,
but the cause of these variations does not seem to be clearly un
derstood.      It has been generally supposed, that this 13 owing to
the state of the atmosphere ; that the air may be too moist or
too dry for electrical experiments ; or that the machine may be
out of order.       But as the Leyden phial cannot be charged un
less it have communication with the ground, it may therefore
be supposed that the action of the machine is influenced by the
electrical state of the earth.      Many ingenious instruments have
been invented for determining the electricity of the atmosphere,
but the electricity of the earth has been much less attended to,
 and therefore much less understood : this may have been owing
to the want of appropriate instruments.
     By an extensive series of experiments, I find that the electri
 city of the earth is as variable as that of the atmosphere ; but
 my experiments are too few (amounting only to about a thou
 sand) to determine the exact quantity of it.             I may, however,
 venture to state, that when the earth is very dry it contains very
 little electricity, but after heavy showers of rain it is generally
found very strongly electrified.
     " In Lima, where there is no rain, they never have any light
 ning or thunder ; and, as M. Tournefort was assured, it never
 rains in the Levant but in winter, and that is the only season
 in which anv thunder is heard." — Phil. Trans. abr. vol. xii.
 p. 661.
     "  The mean annual quantity of rain at Granada, Antilles,
  12° N. is 126 inches*/' (=10 ft. 6 in.) and if the greater portion
 of this water rises again into the atmosphere, after the rainy
 season is over, immense quantities of electricity must be carried
 up with it. Hence the thunder and lightning, tornadoes, hur-
 ricanesi and tempests, are much more dreadful and frequent in
 the torrid zone than in colder climates, where the quantity of
 water and electricity which rises into the atmosphere by evapo
 ration, and falls again to the earth in rain, is much less.
                  On the Electricity   of the Atmosphere.
      That the atmosphere contains much more moisture and elec
  tricity at one time than at another, is well known ; and that
  electricity descends to the earth from the clouds in hail, rain,
  or snow, has been ascertained by various experiments.                But

    how water and electricity        ascend into the atmosphere              is a rhC»
    teorological      question   on which philosophers entertain             different
    opinions.
       The electric spark being passed through atmospheric air,
    light and heat are produced, which shows us the nature of com
    bustion ; but when it is passed through water, two gases are
    formed.     The element of heat and water produce oxygen gas*
r   the element of light and water produce hydrogen gas ; water
    being their common basis.     Consequently by the attraction be
    tween the water upon the surface of the ground and the elec
    tricity in the earth, oxygen and hydrogen gases are formed, and
    become atmospheric air.     Large quantities of water and elec
    tricity are thus carried up into the atmosphere from the sur
    face of the ground in a short time.
       In this case the atmosphere becomes heavier, and the baro
    meter rises ; but when a decomposition of the air takes place, it
    is resolved into its component parts, water and electricitv, which
    descend together to the earth, as mentioned above, the atmo
    sphere becomes lighter and the barometer falls.
        But as the quantities of rain, which have been collected at
    different elevations, differ so widely from one another, a few re
    marks upon that subject may not be unacceptable to those
    who are engaged in the study of meteorology.
                                 Of   the Rain Gage.
       "If a rain gage be placed on the ground,'' says Dr. Thomson,
    " and  another at some height perpendicularly above        more          it,
    rain will be collected into the lower than the higher      proof    5    a
    that the quantity of rain increases as  descends, owing perhaps
                                                 it
    to the drops attracting vapour during their passage through the
    lower strata of the atmosphere, where the greatest quantity re
    sides*."
       The first account that     I    have   seenof observations made on
     two rain gages,     is   that published in the Philosophical Transac
     tions, by Dr. Heberden in 1769.
        But from what     stated above by Dr. Thomson,

LXXXI.     On the Nature and Comlinations of a newly-disco
   vered vegetable Acid ; with Observations on the malic Acid,
   and Suggestions on the Slate in which Acids may have pre
   viously existed in Vegetables.    By M. Donovan, Esq.
   Communicated by W. H. Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S.*
Having      often observed the sour disagreeable taste of the ber
ries of the Sorlms (or Pyrus) aucuparia, it occurred to me that
the juice might contain an acid of a peculiar nature, and I re
solved to submit it to a strict examination.      I was not at that
time acquainted with the fact, that these berries had already
occupied the attention of Scheele, and that this philosopher had
pronounced their acid to be the malic.
   Some preliminary experiments showed me that the juice oc
casioned a precipitation in acetate of lead and nitrate of silver ;
but it produced no change in lime-water, barytes-water, sul
phate of copper, nor, although it might be expected from its
very astringent taste, did it affect sulphate of iron.
   A quantity of the juice was poured into a solution of sugar of
lead ; a curdy and somewhat heavy precipitate appeared, which
was separated by nitration : this, from its solubility in acetic and
dilute nitric acid, I judged to be malate of lead. The filtered
liquor was red, and perfectly transparent ; but after a few hours
I observed a powder deposited at the bottom, and as I saw no
sufficient reason for its appearance, it attracted my attention.
To the naked eye it looked like a coarse powder ; but, when
examined by the microscope, proved to be composed of amor
phous crystalline grains.   With this small quantity of powder I
made some trials, which ended in exciting further .curiosity.        It
was probable, that   the precipitate  which  remained  on  the  filter
might be made to furnish more grains, and accordingly, after
edulcorating the mass, I caused boiling water to pass through
it. After two hours I examined the different washings ; those
made with cold water remained as at first, but those with boiling

434              On the Nature and Combinations
 water had become white and turbid , from the suspension of a
 subtile powder.      In several hours after, the cloud had disap
 peared,   and  displayed an abundant and beautiful 'formation of
slender prismatic crystals, which glistened with silvery splendour
.it the bottom of the vessel. The mass which remained on the
filter had become hard, was much diminished, and was very
dense.
    I accounted for the production of crystals by supposing that
 the precipitate, whatever might be its composition, was insolu
 ble in cold water, but soluble in very large portions of boiling
 water, and hence the crystalline deposition on cooling.    Experi
ment, however, showed that the residual hard mass, even when
levigated, boiled with water, and filtered, would no longer afford
 crystals on cooling : and this was a sufficient objection to my
supposition ; f6r, if one portion of the compound be soluble,
why not the whole ?
    I observed, that even when the precipitate newly obtained
was washed with portions of cold water until it no longer altered
vegetable colours; yet the first, second, and sometimes the
third washing with boiling water would, after the deposition of
the crystals, immediately redden litmus.       An opinion now sug
gested itself, which the following trials greatly strengthened.
    In order to obtain the acid of the saturnine precipitate, the
latter was boiled with dilute sulphuric acid : the liquor became
red and transparent, while the sulphate of lead subsided to the
bottom.      Imagining that I had now obtained the acid in a state
of sufficient purity, although coloured with adhering vegetable
matter, I thought to separate the sediment by filtration, but was
disappointed : for the liquor came through very turbid, notwith
standing that the supernatant liquor had been transparent.         It
was apparent, therefore, that the sulphuric acid being in too
small a quantity, had displaced but a part of the vegetable acid,
that the latter dissolved the remaining part of its own combina
tion with lead, and deposited it when the solution touched any
thing cold, thus producing the turbidness.       After some hours,
the turbidness in the filtered liquor subsided, forming a stratum
on the bottom of the vessel, over which lay a number of cry
stals.
    The theory of the crystalline formation in the washings of the
precipitate now became obvious.        It appeared that when the
saturnine compound was washed with cold water, no other ef
fect than edulcoration was produced : but that hot water par
tially decomposed the mass into a super- and a sub-salt, the for
mer of which being soluble in boiling water, filtered through,
but on cooling, deposited crystals of the neutral salt, while free
                                                                acid

                    of a newly -discovered     vegetable    Acid.         435
 acid was left dissolved in the liquor.            The first washing con
 tained most free acid, and therefore suffered least of the neutral
 salt to crystallize.
    The red acid liquor, as has been stated, contained much lead,
and this it was necessary to separate.                 The most unexcep
 tionable method appeared to be the transmission of sulphuretted
 hydrogen through the clear liquor. This was accordingly done,
lifter having heated the acid liquor so as to redissolve the crystals
 and sediment.        The resulting sulphuret of lead was filtered off,
 and the clear fluid was boiled for a length of time, to expel the
 superfluous gas.
    Supposing now that I had obtained the pure acid, I began
 to form various conjectures as to its nature ; in the midst of
 which I discovered that the berries of the Sorlus aucuparia
 had already occupied the attention of Scheele, and that lie had
 pronounced their acid to be the malic.                There was indeed a
 great   coincidence     of  properties   between     the   two acids: malic
 acid   is   red,  when     evaporated to dryness        it   deliquesces, its
 combinations with potash, soda, and ammonia are deliquescent;
 such were also the properties of the acid under consideration.
 Yet I had never understood that malate of lead could be made
 to afford crystals : an experiment on this head, therefore, be
 came necessary.
     The juice of nearly ripe apples was saturated with potash,
 and the solution when filtered was mixed with solution of acetate
 of lead: the precipitate was collected on a filter. This after
 being edulcorated was washed with boiling water, as before. In
 sixteen hours, crystals, precisely the same as the berries had af
 forded, were deposited, although less in quantity.
      The production of crystals in both these cases seemed to
 show that the acid of both fruits was the same: yet there was
 one difference.       The precipitate remaining on the filter, after
 the action of boiling water, was, in that produced from apples,
 soft and pasty; but that obtained from the Sorbus berries was
 hard and dense.          It became therefore necessary, to discover
  what would be the habitudes of malate of lead obtained by other
  means.
     Scheele showed that the primary action of nitrous acid on
  sugar is to form malic acid.         I therefore heated together equal
  weights   of  these  substances,   until  the effervescence ceased. The
  brown    residue   was  diluted with   lime-water,    and when the oxalic
  acid that migqt have been formed was in this manner separated,
  the remaining acid substance was saturated with potash. Acetate
  of lead was added, and the malate of lead thus formed was col
  lected and edulcorated.
     It now remained to ascertain whether this malate possessed
                                    Ee2                                     the

                                                                          '
436                    On the Nature and Combinations
the   property of crystallizing, like that prepared from apple
juice.      I accordingly poured on it different portions of boiling
water,   which     were received in different vessels : the washings
were   all   of  a  brownish-yellow colour, from a small quantity of
malate of lead held dissolved.          At the end of 48 hours this salt
was all deposited in the state of a brown subtile powder, but
there was no formation whatever of crystals.             On the surface of
each washing was an iridescent pellicle of some lustre, which I
found to be characteristic of the malic acid.            This experiment,
as Scheele directs, was made with weak nitric acid ; 1 repeated
it with an acid of considerable strength, but after sixty hours
there was not one crystal.
    It deserves attention, that the matter which remained on the
filter in these two experiments, after washing with boiling water,
were as soft and pasty as when first collected ; whereas the salt
of lead obtained from the berries of the Sorbus had grown dense,
hard, and was much diminished.
    The saturpine compound that had been formerly obtained
from the berries, when partially decomposed by sulphuric acid,
afforded crystals on cooling.         In order to ascertain if the malate
of lead obtained from sugar would do the same, I repeated the
process on     it, but obtained no crystals. — These experiments were
made under almost every possible circumstance with the same
results .
     1next precipitated all the lead from the remaining malate                                :
the malic acid thus obtained was again mixed with acetate                                     of
lead, and the precipitate treated with boiling water as before                                :
but the results were the same.             From this malate of lead the
acid was again separated, and the same process as before was
four times repeated          but notwithstanding nearly all the foreign
                              :
matter was thus separated, no crystals formed.
    Scheele found that the gooseberry- contains nearly equal parts
of citric and malic acids.            thought
                                       I           necessary to examine

this fruit would afford crystals.         Scheele's process for separating

     The raspberry was found by Scheele to contain the same
 acids.    I examined this fruit in a similar manner, but no crystals
 were produced.
     Vauquelin detected malic acid in a variety of plants, but in
 none so abundantly as the Sempervivum Tectorum.                   In the juice
of this plant it is united to lime in the state of a supersalt*.
     Malate of lead was formed by pouring solution of acetate of
 lead into the filtered juice of this plant.         The precipitate, when
washed with boiling water, deposited on cooling the same sub
 tile powder as usual, but no crystals.              Nor were any obtained
when the malate was partially decomposed by sulphuric acid, in
 the manner already described.
    Scheele found that the berries of the Samhtcus nigra contain
 the malic acid unmixed with any other.                I therefore examined
their very mucilaginous juice, but could not produce crystals.
     As in my experiments on apples I had obtained crystals, I
wished to try what effect the vinous fermentation might have on
their juice. The process was repeated with cyder ; but I was
surprised to find, that although a malate of lead was obtained,
 the property of forming crystals had been destroyed.
     From various conjectures it appeared possible that the berries
of the Sorbin, while very young, might perhaps contain a malic
acid that would furnish few or no crystals.                In the beginning
of August (1612), the berries being still green, I made an in
fusion of them, which after filtration afforded a precipitate with
acetate of lead.       Boiling water produced no crystals, nor did
the mass become hard as on former occasions.
    Seven varieties of malic acid had now been examined, which
when united to lead would not afford crystals.                 In the two lat
ter cases it was surprising that those acids which in other trials
afforded abundance, would now afford none.                  That the juice of
the green berries was real malic acid, was proved by the follow
ing properties  :
     1. The acid, when separated from the juice, was of              a crimson
colour.
    2. When evaporated to dryness, it soon deliquesced.
    3. When rendered solid, and acted on by nitrous acid, some
crystals of oxalic acid appeared.
    4. The acid formed deliquescent salts with potash, soda, and
ammonia.
    5. Its combinations with lime and lead possessed their pro
per characteristics.

and the compound treated with boiling water: the washings

  438                 On the Nature and Comlinations
  deposited     much more crystals         than mature apples would have
  done.
      The truth was now manifest.             Beside the malic, there is an
  other acid formation, which in different fruits is formed at dif
  ferent periods, and which has hitherto escaped observation: and
  I consider the preceding details by no means redundant, inas
  much as they estabish one decided difference between the two
  acids.      Many others will shortly be stated.
      The first step towards confirming the difference, was to obtain
  the new acid in a state of purity: and after numerous attempts,
  I  found that the only way to obtain it pure, was to separate it
  from the crystals.      The process is indeed complex and difficult.
      The berries of the Sorlms aucuparia are to be collected when
. first they have arrived at maturity.            After sufficient bruising in
  a Wedgwood mortar, they are to be subjected to strong pres
  sure in a linen bag.        If collected at the most favourable time,
  they   will  afford nearly one half their weight of juice, s. G. 1077.
  This after due subsidence is to be strained, and mixed with fil
  tered solution of acetate of lead.            The precipitate is to be col
  lected on a filter, and in order to separate any uncombined co
  louring matter, it should be washed with cold water.                   A very
  large quantity     of boiling  water   is  to be  poured  on  the filter, and
  allowed to pass through the precipitate into different glass jars.
  After some hours, the washings become opaque, and at length
  deposit crystals of singular lustre and beauty.                 Those which
  have been formed in the colourless washings are to be alone re
  tained; they are to be separated by the filter, dried in the air,
  and preserved for a further process.
      The original mass remaining on the filter, from which the
  crystals have been obtained, being now hard and brittle, is in
  capable of affording any more, without undergoing a new ope
  ration. It is to be boiled for half an hour with a 'little more
  dilute sulphuric acid than is sufficient to decompose the salt ;
  when cold it is to be filtered.         The filtered liquor is to be mixed
  a second time with acetate of lead ; the precipitate washed, as.
  before, with boiling water, and the crystals selected from the
  colourless washings only.           The remaining mass again grown
  hard,   is to  undergo   the   process of decomposition with sulphuric
  acid, combination with lead, and the formation of crystals : and
  after all, it will be found that the crystals of all the processes
  will be inconsiderable when collected.
      The whole of the crystalline product being dried, is to be
  boiled for half an hour with 2*3 times its weight of sulphuric
  acid, s. G. lOflG, supplying water as fast as it evaporates, and
  taking care to keep the mixture constantly stirred with a glass
  rod. The clear liquor is to be filtered off, and poured into a
                                                                            tall

tall glass jar of small diameter.        While still hot, a stream of
 sulphuretted hydrogen is to be transmitted through it; and when
all the lead has been precipitated, the fluid is to be filtered off,
and boiled in an open basin, until the discharged vapour no longer
blacken paper impregnated with acetate of* lead.
    The theory of the process is obvious. When acetate of lead
 is added to the juice, malate of lead and the combination of the
 new acid with lead precipitate ; the latter is decomposed by
boiling water into a super- and a sub-salt : the super-salt is held
in solution ; but as the liquor cools, the neutral compound de
posits itself in crystals, and the first washings contain most free
 acid.    When boiling water is no longer able to overcome the
 attraction of the latter portions of acid to oxide of lead, no more
.crystals can be formed.        We then apply the stronger power of
sulphuric acid, we obtain the free vegetable acid, and proceed
as at first.   When all the crvstals are collected, such a quantity
of sulphuric acid is added as will be nearly sufficient to decom
pose them : this is so done in order completely to exclude the
sulphuric acid, which without this precaution would be exceed
ingly difficult to effect. The uiulecomposed portion of the crv
stals dissolves in the vegetable acid newly extricated : but if in
the boiling the fluid were not continually stirred, a mass would
be formed in the bottom so hard as to resist decomposition.           If
the liquor after filtering were allowed to cool, the neutral salt
would crystallize; it must therefore be used hot.          The stream
of sulphuretted hydrogen passing through so high a column of
fluid soon separates the lead, while the pure vegetable acid is
liberated, contaminated indeed with a little sulphuretted hydro
gen.     This gas does not disappear completely by boiling, for the
acid retains the odour, be it ever so long boiled ; exposure for
a few days in an open vessel dissipates it completely.
    In preparing this acid, it is not necessary, as it is ill the pro
cess for malic acid, to saturate the juice of the berries with potash,
at the commencement of the process; for, of the two compounds
formed after the mixture with acetate of lead, the maiate dis
solves in the evolved acetic acid in preference to the other. The
colouring matter, which adheres obstinately to the malate of
lead, is very apt, when extricated during the washing with boiling
water, to tinge the otherwise perfectly colourless crystals, which
form as the liquor cools.       This is a great inconvenience, for the
colouring    matter  cannot  be washed  away, even by cold water, with
out decomposing a quantity of the salt: hence the only remedy
is,  to reject all the crystals formed in the coloured washings, and
to reserve those only that are of pure whiteness.

are of so delicate  a   fabric that they must be separated       by the

acetate of mercury, but still more beautiful.
     As to the amorphous crystalline grains which first attracted
 my attention, the following experiment elucidates the theory of
 their formation. A quantity of the pure acid obtained by the above
 process, was boiled for some time on an excess of carbonate
 of magnesia. The liquor after filtration was found to restore
 the original colour of reddened litmus, and to render green the
 tincture of cabbage.     An acetate of lead was formed by boiling
 solution of super-acetate on carbonate of lead.. This solution
 was mixed with the former, and the precipitate was collected by
 the filter.
     Notwithstanding the evident excess of magnesia existing in
 one solution, and the necessary neutrality of the other, yet the
 filtered liquor was found strongly to redden litmus paper.       We
 are not to suppose that the two salts evolved a free acid during
 their mutual decomposition.        As much oxide of lead was li
 berated from the acetate, as was necessary to the neutrality of
 the acid eliminated from the compound with magnesia ; the so
  lution would therefore have retained all its ingredients in a state
  of neutrality, except that which originally contained an excess
  of magnesia. But the new salt of lead, at the moment of its
  formation, was decomposed by the water present into a super-
  and a sub-salt ; the excess of acid being not only sufficient to
  saturate the redundant magnesia, but also to leave a portion free
  in the solution.   This liquor, after an hour, deposited a quantity
  of crystalline grains, and after that, the acidity increased.
  Hence appears the reason of a crystallization in the original li
  quor : a super-salt is formed, which after a while deposits the
  neutral salt in a crystalline form.
     This acid appearing, from what has been already stated as
  well as from what will be hereafter detailed, to be of a peculiar
  nature, it became necessary to give it a name. After some con
  sideration I bestowed on it one, which, although not unexcep
  tionable, is sufficiently accordant with the general analogy of
  chemical nomenclature, and which has received the approbation
  of some competent judges. Until a better name be devised, I
  have called it the Sorbic acid.
      To establish its peculiar nature, I have examined its combi
   nations with certain bases, but have confined myself to those
   of which the analogous combinations amongst the malates had
   been already examined by Scheeie.       The sorbic and malic acids
   not having been distinguished by that philosopher, it seemed
  that here the distinction ought particularly to be established:
   and the standard of comparison must necessarily be whatever
   had been ascertained of the malates by their discoverer.
                                                               Sorbic

                of a newly -discovered  vegetable Acid.          1441
   Sorbic acid, when perfectly pure, is a transparent, colourless,
 and inodorous fluid, soluble in alcohol, and in any proportion of
water.     When evaporated, it forms an uncrystallizable         solid
mass which deliquesces: when subjected to distillation, the li
quor which passes over shows no traces of acidity.         Its acidity
is such that it causes even a painful sensation on the organs of
taste.    It is not much altered by being kept in an uncombined
state.    I have had it for more than a year in a corked phial,
and at the end of that time no other change was produced than
the separation of a tenuous coagulum, small in quantity, as the
acid was very pure, but it is more abundant when the acid is
impure. . When mixed with malic acid, as in fruits, this acid is
the first to disappear, while the other retains its properties long
after the commencement of decay in the plant.
   A quantity of malate of lead obtained from Sempervivum Tec-
torum was boiled with sorbic acid and a little water ; the whole
from being colourless became somewhat brown.              The liquor
was then filtered, and the turbid liquor which came through
was heated until it became clear ; it was then suffered to rest.
As it cooled, it let fall a powder ; but when this was filtered off
the liquor remained clear, and in an hour a great profusion of
crystals was let fall.    The mass which remained on the filter
contained some gritty particles.
    Thus it is evident that malate of lead was decomposed by
sorbic acid, which could not happen unless the latter were a
distinct substance. The malate was only partly decomposed,
the oxide of lead united to the excess of sorbic acid forming
super-sorbate of lead, while the disengaged malic acid dissolved
as much as it could of the remaining undecomposed malate,
forming super-malate of lead. The brown colour was produced
by disengaged malic acid. The super-malate, as it cooled, de
posited its malate in the state of powder, and the super-sorbate
soon after deposited -sorbate of lead in the state of crystals ; and
the original mass was found to contain gritty particles of sub-
sorbate.
    In the same manner, when        a precipitate obtained by acetate
of   lead   from the juice of the Sorbus berries is washed with
boiling water, scarcely any malate of lead is deposited; and if
the fluid contain much free sorbic acid, the iridescent pellicle,
which is a characteristic of malate of lead, does not appear.
    I shall now proceed to the combinations of this acid, so as to
distinguish it from malic acid : and first the salts which it forms
with lead should be briefly recapitulated.
    The sub-sorbate is insoluble in water ; if in a mass, it is
dense and hard : if in powder, it is gritty.
    The neutral sorbate, if obtained by precipitation, is a white
                                                              powder,

442             On the Nature and Combinations
powder, but if obtained from solution in its own acid, it is in
beautiful silvery crystals.  Neither of these salts is soluble in
5000 times its weight of water.      The sorbate when heated to
redness undergoes a somewhat brilliant combustion.
   The super-sorbate never assumes the solid form ; its taste is
sweet.     Thus the sorbic acid forms three combinations with
lead: malic forms but two; the neutral malate, which is an un-
crystallizable soft powder, and the super-malate.     Not less di
stinguishable are the two acids by their combinations with the
alkalies.
    Sorbate of potash, when there is an excess of acid, forms per
manent crystals soluble in water, but insoluble in alcohol.
   Sorbate of soda, when there is an excess of acid, forms per
manent crystals, which agree in characters with the former.
   Sorbate of ammonia, when there is an excess of acid, also
forms permanent crystals of similar characters with the pre
ceding.
   These three salts will not crystallize unless there be a tolera
ble excess of acid ; they are to be considered as super- salts.
That of soda even requires the aid of cold to render it solid.
The malates of potash, soda, and ammonia are known to be un-
crystallizable and deliquescent.
    In the combinations of these acids with earths, there are also
striking differences.     Scheele found, that when he added car
bonate    of lime to malic acid, a great quantity was dissolved, but
the solution gave with litmus indications of an abundant acid
which it was impossible to neutralize with further additions of
chalk*. I obtained the same result with malic acid from the
 Sempervivum ; I even found that the solution might be boiled to
dryness, on a fresh portion of carbonate of lime ; yet when lixi
viated, the filtered solution would still redden litmus, and the
salt finally afforded was readily soluble.   These results often ob
tained, prove that it is not possible to form neutral malate from
carbonate of lime.
   But with sorbic acid the case was quite different.       When it
was diluted, and agitated for a little while with carbonate of
lime, the solution, before it could be filtered, deposited the
principal part of the sorbate in the form of a discrete, gritty
powder.      The liquor when filtered produced no redness in tinc
ture of litmus, and every thing proved that the fluid by mere
agitation over the carbonate had been completely neutralized.
   The same results which Scheele obtained from lime were af
forded by carbonate of barytes : but with sorbic acid I produced
a liquor which showed no signs of acidity.        The best test for
                *

 ascertaining this fact, seemed to be infusion of brazil wood al
 tered by distilled vinegar ; and with this it even appeared that
 the solution contained an excess of base.
    Thus it appears, that malic acid never forms with carbonate
 of lime any other than acidulous salts; and, as Scheele ob
 serves, these solutions in some days deposit the neutral salt in
 crystals.      But with these carbonates the sorbic acid forms
 neutral salts, which, as soon as formed, precipitate.
    Scheele ascertained that malate of magnesia is a deliques
 cent salt*, and in my trials I could not. obtain it in a crystalline
 form. When evaporated, it became thick, and dried into a
 semitransparent     substance, which softened with the smallest
 quantity of water, and formed matter of a syrupy consistence.
 The same earth, heated in sorbic acid, afforded a liquor which,
 after filtration, deposited permanent crystals in abundance: they
Tequired for solution no less than 28 parts of water at 60.        f
    The malate of alumina was found by Scheele to be a salt
very difficult of solution.      1 wished to discover     the properties
of the sorbate.      I therefore boiled some very pure alumina that
had been just prepared, and was therefore still soft, with sorbic
acid : the boiling was continued for almost an hour, and after
filtration, I discovered with no small surprise that the alumina
had not been acted upon.         The acid was tried by every means,
and nothing but the most minute vestiges of the earth could be
obtained. Thus there is no sorbate of alumina.
    I consider that from this property the sorbic acid may become
a valuable instrument of analysis.         The process for separating
alumina from other earths has been complicated and uncertain:
may it not be rendered simple by the use of this acid, employed
in excess ?
    Thus, I think there can be no doubt that the sorbic acid is
an acid sui generis, and probably intermediate between malic
and oxalic. With regard to the other acids, with which the sor
bic coexists in fruits, it is to be observed, that .it is never found
in mature fruits that contain any other than the malic ; that the
latter is never found alone in any mature fruit, but always ac
companied by the sorbic; and that these two acids, when toge
ther, exclude all others. To this, however, there is an apparent
exception, namely, the berry of the Sambucus nigra, which (pro
bably from the immense quantity of mucilage and colouring
matter present) afforded me no sorbic acid.             The fruits that

   t It deserves remark, that in Schecle's experiments there could have
been no sorbic acid present, as might have been expected, had he pre
pared his acid from apples : he obtained it from gooseberries, and thereby
avoided this source of fallacy.
                                                                  contain

 of the Sorlus contain the greatest quantity of sorbic acid, unripe
 apples less, ripe apples and sloes still less, barberries very little,
 and plums least of all.        The green berries of the Sorbus, (per
 haps,) those of the Sambucus, and the plant Sempervivum Tecto-

 foregoing statements, raspberries and gooseberries, as they contain
 citric and malic acids, contain no sorbic whatever.

 LXXXII.        On the Fire-damp         of Coal-mines, and      on Methods
     of  lighting the Mines so as        to prevent     its Explosion.       By
     Sir H. Davy,      LL.D. F.R.S. KP.R.L*
 The       accidents arising from the explosion of the fire-damp or
 inflammable gas of coal mines, mixed with atmospherical air,
 are annually becoming more frequent and more destructive iu
 the collieries in the North of England.
     A committee has been for some time formed at Sunderland
 for the benevolent purpose of investigating the causes of these
 accidents, and of searching for means of preventing them.                    In
 consequence of an invitation from the Rev. Dr. Gray, one of the
 most active members of this committee, I was induced to turn
my attention to the subject.            I went to the North of England,
 and visited some of the principal collieries in the neighbourhood
of Newcastle, for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of
the workings, and the state of their ventilation.                 I found the
greatest desire to assist my inquiries in the gentlemen acquainted
with the northern collieries, as well as in the inspectors or viewers
of the mines: and I have particular obligations on this point to
the Rev. Dr. Gray, Cuthbert Ellison, Esq. M.P., the Rev. John
Hodgson, Mr. Buddie, and Mr. Dunn.                        Dr. Fenwick, Dr.
Clanny, and Mr. Fenwick, likewise kindly offered me their as
sistance.
    From the information which I collected on the spot, increased
by the perusal of a Report of Mr. Buddie on the state of the
mines, I was convinced that, as far as ventilation was concerned,

esting paper before tlie usual period.      In fact, the Royal Society, with its

      of lighting the Mines   so as to prevent   its Explosion.   445
 the resources of modern science had been fully employed; and
 that a mode of preventing accidents was only to be sought for
 in a method of lighting the mines free from danger, and which,
 by indicating the state of the air in the part of the mine where
 inflammable air was disengaged, so as to render the atmosphere
 explosive, should oblige the miners to retire till the workings
 were properly cleared.
    An account of an ingenious apparatus for burning a candle
 supplied with atmospherical air by a bellows through water, has
 been published in the Philosophical Transactions by Dr. Clanny;
 but I believe this apparatus has not yet been used in any of the
 collieries..    /
     The common means employed for lighting those parts of the
 mine where danger is apprehended from the fire-damp, is bv a
 steel wheel, which being made to revolve in contact with flint,
 affords a succession of sparks: but this apparatus always re
 quires a person to work it; and, though much less liable to ex
plode the fire-damp than a common candle, yet it is said to be
not entirely free from danger.
     Mr. Buddie having obligingly shown to me the degree of light
 required for working the collieries, I made several experiments,
with the hope of producing such a degree of light, without ac
 tive inflammation ; I tried Kunckel's, Canton's, and Baldwin's
 phosphorus, and likewise the electrical light in close vessels, but
 without success ; and even had these degrees of light been suf
 ficient, the processes for obtaining them, I found, would be too
 complicated and difficult for the miners.
     The fire-damp has been shown by Dr. Henry, in a very in
 genious paper published in the nineteenth volume of Nicholson's
 Journal, to be light carburetted hydrogen gas, and Dr. Thomson
 has made some experiments upon it ; but the degree of its com-
bustibilty, as compared with that of other inflammable gases,
"has not, I believe, been examined, nor have many different spe
 cimens of it been analysed ; and it appeared to me, that some
 minute chemical experiments on its properties ought to be the
preliminary steps to inquiries respecting methods of preventing its
 explosion. I therefore procured various specimens of the fire-damp
 in its purest state, and made a number of experiments upon it.
 And in examining its relations to combustion I was so fortunate
 as to discover some properties belonging to      it,
                                                   which appear to
 lead to very simple methods of lighting the mines, without dan
 ger to the miners, and which,  I   hope, will supply the desidera
 tum so long anxiously required     byhumanity.    Ishall   inthe fol
 lowing pages have the honour of describing these properties, and
 the methods founded upon them, to the Royal Society, and           1
 shall conclude with some general observations.
                                                                  The

446         On the Fire-damp       of Coal-Mines, and        on   Methods
   The fire-damp     is produced in small         quantities      in coal mines,
during the common process           of working.
    The Rev. Mr. Hodgson informed me, that on pounding some
common Newcastle coal fresh from the mine in a cask furnished
with a small aperture, the gas from the aperture was inflam
mable.     And on breaking some large lumps of coal under water,
I ascertained that they gave off inflammable gas*. Gas is like
wise disengaged from bituminous schist, when it is worked.
     The great sources of the fire-damp in mines are, however,
what are called blowers, or fissures in the broken strata, near
dykes, from which currents of fire-damp issue in considerable
quantity, and sometimes for a long course of years            When      f.
old workings are broken into, likewise, they        are often  found
filled with fire-damp ; and the deeper the mine the more com
mon in general is this substance.
     I have analysed several specimens of the fire-damp in the
laboratory of the Royal Institution ; the pure inflammable part
was the same in all of them, but it was sometimes mixed with
small quantities of atmospherical       air, and in some instances
with azote and carbonic acid.
    Of six specimens collected by Mr. Dunn from a blower in the
Hepburn Colliery, by emptying bottles of water close to           the         it,
purest contained T'T only of atmospherical air, with no other
contamination, and the most impure contained               of atmo
spherical air    so that this air was probably derived from the cir
                 ;
cumambient air of the mine.        The weight of the purest speci
men was for 100 cubical inches 19*5 grains.
  * This     probably owing to the coal strata having been formed under
            is                                                                      a
  ressure greater than that of the atmosphere, so that they give off elastic
  uid when they are exposed to the free atmosphere: and probably coals
containing animal remains evolve not only the fire-damp, but likewise
azote and carbonic acid, as   inthe instance of the gas sent     Dr. Clauny.
                                                                   by
   In the Apennines, near Pietra Mala,    I   examined a fire produced by

experiments, in my journey, collected some gas from      acavity in the earth
about a miie from Pietra Mala, then filled with water, and which, from
the quantity of gas disengaged,     called Aqua Buja.

hydro-carbonate, requiring two volumes of oxygen for its combustion, and
producing    avolume of carbonic acid gas.

    One measure of it required for its complete combustion by
the electric spark nearly two measures of oxygen, and they formed
nearly one measure of carbonic acid.
    Sulphur heated strongly,- and repeatedly sublimed in a por
tion of it freed from oxygen by phosphorus, produced a consi
derable enlargement of its volume, sulphuretted hydrogen was
formed, and charcoal precipitated ; and it was found that the
volume of the sulphuretted hydrogen produced, when it was ab
sorbed by solution of potassa, was exactly double that of the
fire-damp decomposed.
    It did not act upon chlorine in the cold ; but, when an elec
tric spark was passed through a mixture of one part of it with
two of chlorine, there was an explosion, with a diminution to
less than 1 -4th, and much charcoal was deposited.
    The analysis of specimens of gas sent to my friend John
George Children, Esq. by Dr. Clanny, afforded me similar re
sults ; but they contained variable quantities of carbonic acid
gas and azote.
    Different specimens of these gases were tried by the test of
exposure to chlorine both in darkness and light: they exhibited
no marks of the presence of olefiant gas or hydrogen ; and the
residuum produced by detonation with chlorine showed them to
be free from carbonic oxide.
    It is evident, then, that the opinion formed by other chemists
respecting the fire-damp is perfectly correct; and that it is the
same substance as the inflammable gas of marshes, the exact
chemical nature of which was first demonstrated by Mr. Dalton;
and that it consists, according to my view of definite propor
tions, of 4 proportions of hydrogen in weight 4, and one pro
portion of charcoal in weight 1 1,5.
    I made several experiments on the combustibility and explosive
nature of the fire-damp. When 1 part of fire-damp was mixed
with 1 of air, they burnt by the approach of a lighted taper, but
did not explode ; 2 of air and 3 of air to 1 of gas produced si
milar results. When 4 of air and 1. of gas were exposed to a
lighted candle, the mixture being in the quantity of 6 or 7 cu
bical inches in a narrow-necked bottle, a flame descended through
the mixture, but there was no noise : 1 part of gas inflamed
with 6 parts of air in a similar bottle, produced a slight whistling
sound : 1 part of gas with 8 parts of air, rather a louder sound :
1 part with 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 parts, still inflamed,     but the
violence of combustion diminished.          In 1 part of gas and 15
parts of air, the candle burnt without explosion with a greatly
enlarged flame ; and the effect of enlarging the flame, but in a
gradually diminishing ratio, was produced as far as 30 parts of
air to 1 of gas.
                                                                The

448    On the Fire-damp    qf Coal-mines, and   on Methods
   The mixture which seemed to possess the greatest explosive
power, was that of 7 or S parts of air to 1 of gas ; but the re
port produced by 50 cubical inches of this mixture was less than
that produced by y~ of the quantity of a mixture of 2 parts of
atmospherical air and 1 of hydrogen.
   It was very important to ascertain the degree of heat required-
to explode the fire-damp mixed with its proper proportion of
air.
   I found that a common electrical spark would not explode 5
parts of air and 1 of fire-dahip, though it exploded 6 parts of
air and 1 of damp : but very strong sparks from the discharge of
a Leyden jar seemed to have the same power of exploding dif
ferent mixtures of the gas as tile flame of the taper.      Well-
burned charcoal, ignited    to the strongest red heat, did not ex
plode any mixture of air and of the fire-damp ; and a fire made
of well-burned charcoal, i.e. charcoal that burned without flame,
was blown up to whiteness by an explosive mixture containing
the fire-damp, without producing its inflammation.         An iron
rod at the highest degree of red heat, and at the common de
gree of white heat, did not inflame explosive mixtures of the
fire-damp ; but, when in brilliant combustion, it produced the
effect.
   The flame of gaseous oxide of carbon as well as of defiant
gas exploded the mixtures of the fire-damp.
    In respect of combustibility, then, the fire-damp differs most
materially from the other common inflammable gases. Olefiant
gas, which I have found explodes mixed in the same proportion
with air, is fired by both charcoal and iron heated to dull red
ness.    Gaseous oxide of carbon, which explodes when mixed
with 2 parts of air, is likewise inflammable by red-hot iron and
charcoal.    And hydrogen, which explodes when mixed with
3-/ths of its volume of air, take's fire at the lowest visible heat
of iron and charcoal ; and the case is the same with sulphuretted
hydrogen.
   I endeavoured to ascertain the degree of expansion of mix
tures of fire-damp and air during their explosion, and likewise
their power of communicating flame through apertures to other
explosive mixtures.
   I found that when 6 of air and 1 of fire-damp were exploded
over water by a strong electrical spark, the explosion was not
very strong, and, at the moment of the greatest expansion, the
volume of the gas did not appear to be increased more than      -J.
   In exploding a mixture of  1  part of gas from the distillation
of coal, and 8   parts of air in a tube ofa quarter of an inch in
diameter and a foot long, more than a second was required be
fore the flame reached from one end of the tube to the other;
                                                               and

      of lighting    the Mines so as to prevent its Explosion.            449
and I could not make any mixture explode in a glass tube l-7th                  v
of an inch in diameter: and this gas was more inflammable than
the fire-damp, as it consisted of earburetted hydrogen gas mixed
with some defiant gas.
   In exploding mixtures of fire-damp and air in a jar connected
with the atmosphere by an aperture of half an inch, and con
nected with a bladder by a stopcock, having an aperture of
nbout l-6th of an inch*, I found that the flame passed into the
atmosphere, but did not communicate through the stopcock,
so as to inflame the mixture in the bladder: and in comparing
the power of tubes of metal and those of glass, it appeared that
the flame passed more readily through glass tubes of the same
diameter; and that explosions were stopped by metallic tubes
of 1 -5th of an inchf, when they were              If  inch long; and this
phaenomenon probably depends upon the heat lost during the
explosion in contact with so great a cooling surface, which
brings the temperature of the first portions exploded below that
required for the firing of the other portions.             Metal is a better
conductor of heat than glass : and it has been already shown
that the fire-damp requires a very strong heat for its inflamma
tion .
   Mixture of the gas with air I found, likewise, would not ex
plode in metallic canals or troughs, when their diameter was
less than the l-7th of an inch, and their depth considerable in
proportion to their diameter ; nor .could explosions be made to
pass through such canals.
   Explosions likewise I found would not. pass through very fine
wire sieves or wire gauze.
    I mixed azote and carbonic acid in different quantities with
explosive mixtures of fire-damp, and I found that even in very
small proportions they diminished the velocity of the inflamma
tion.    Azote, when mixed in the proportion of 1 to 6 of an ex
plosive mixture, containing 12 of air and 1 of fire-damp, de
prived it of its power of explosion ; when 1 part of azote was
mixed with 7 of an explosive mixture, only a feeble blue flame
slowly passed through the mixture.
    1 part of carbonic acid to 7 of an explosive mixture deprived
it of the power of exploding ; so that its effects are more re
markable than those of azote ; probably, in consequence of its
   * Since these experiments were made, Dr. Wollaston lias informed me,
that he and Mr. Tennant had observed some time ago, that mixtures of
the gas from the distillation of coal and air would not explode in very
 small tubes.
   fI   do nik give this result as perfectly exact, as the bore of the metallic
tube had not the same polisb as that of the tube of glass.

greater    capacity for heat, and probably, likewise, of a higher
conducting power connected with its greater density.
    The consideration of these various facts led me to adopt a
form of a lamp, in which the flame by being supplied with only
a limited quantity of air, should produce such a quantity of azote
and carbonic acid as to prevent the explosion of the fire damp,
and which, by the nature of its apertures for giving admittance                      -
and exit to the air, should be rendered incapable of communi
cating any explosion to the external air.                 >
     If in a close lantern, supplied with a small aperture below
%nd another above, a lighted lamp having a very small wick be
 placed, the natural flame gradually diminishes, till it arrives at a
 point at which the supply of air is sufficient for the combustion
 of a certain small quantity of oil ; if a lighted taper be intro
 duced into the lantern through a small door in the side, which
 is instantly closed, both lights will burn for a few seconds, and
 be extinguished together*
     A similar phaenomenon occurs,         in close lantern, supplied

     1tried several experiments on the burning of          a  flame fn at
mospheres containing fire-damp.            inclosed

low its natural size.      I   placed this lantern, the taper bemg
lighted, on         stand under      large glass receiver standing in
                    a a

to enable the candle to burn for some minutes          ;   Ithen rapidlv
threw quantity of fire-damp into the receiver from
           a
                                                                  bladder,
                                                                    a
so as to make the atmosphere           inexplosive.
                                            it          As the fire-damp
mixed with the air, the flame of the taper gradually enlarged,
till  ithalf filled the lantern   ;  then rapidly diminished, and was
                                      it
suddenly extinguished        without the slightest explosion.            ex  I
amined the air of the receiver after the experiment, 'and found
it highly explosive.
                                                                        I    tried

         of iighting  the Mines so as to prevent its 'Explosion.    45  1
       I tried similar experiments, throwing in mixtures of air and
   fire-damp, some containing the maximum and others the mini
  mum of fire-damp necessary for explosion, and always with the
   same satisfactory results.     The flame considerably increased,
   and was soon extinguished.
       I introduced a lighted lantern to which air was supplied by
  two glass tubes T'„- of an inch in diameter and half an inch long,
  into a large jar containing an explosive mixture of 1 part of
  fire-damp and 10 parts of air ; the taper burnt at first with a
  feeble light, the flame soon became enlarged, and was then ex
  tinguished.      I repeated these experiments several times, and
 .with a perfect constancy of result.
      It is evident, then, that to prevent explosions in coal mines,
 it is only necessary to use air-tight lanterns, supplied with air
 from tubes or canals of small diameter, or from apertures co
  vered with wire gauze placed bsjow the flame, through which
 explosions cannot be communicated, and having a chimney at
  the upper part, on a similar system for carrying off the foul air ;
 and common lanterns may be easily adapted to the purpose, by
 being made air-tight in the door and sides, by being furnished
 with the chimney, and the system of safety apertures below and
  above.
      The principle being known, it is easy to adopt and multiply
  practical applications of it.
      The first safe-lantern that I hnd constructed was made of
 tin-plate, and the light emitted through four glass plates in the
(sides.      The air was admitted round the bottom of the flame from
 a number of metallic tubes of £ of an inch in diameter, and an
inch and \ long. The chimney was composed of two open.
 cones, having a common base perforated with many small aper
 tures, and fastened to the top of the lantern, which was made
 tight in a pneumatic rim containing a little oil ; the upper and
 lower apertures in the chimney were about ^ of an inch : the
 lamp, which was fed with oil, gave a steady flame of about an
inch high and half an inch in diameter.             When the lantern
 was slowly moved, I he lamp continued to burn, but more feebly ;
 and when it was rapidly moved, it went out.            To obviate this
circumstance, I surrounded the bottom of the lantern with a
perforated rim; and this arrangement perfectly answered the
 end proposed.
      I had another chimney fitted to this lantern, furnished with
 a number of safety tin-plate tubes of the sixth of an inch in
 diameter and two inches long : but they diminished considerably
 the size of the flame, and rendered it more liable to go out by
 motion ; and the following experiments appear to show, that if
 the diameter of the upper orifice of the chimney' be not very
                               F f2                              large,

452           On the Fire-damp of Coal Alines, and on Methods
  large, it is scarcely possible that any explosion produced by th£
 'flame can reach it.'
     I threw into the safe-lantern with the common chimney, 3
  mixture of 15 parts of air and 1 of fire-damp: the flame was
  immediately greatly enlarged, and the flame of the wick seemed
  to be lost in the larger flame of the fire-damp.         I placed a
  lighted taper above the orifice of the chimney: it was imme
  diately extinguished, but without the slightest previous increase
,'of its flame, and even the wick instantly lost its fire by being
  plunged into the chimney.
     I introduced a lighted taper into a close vessel containing 15
  parts of air and 1 of gas from the distillation of coal, suffered it
 to burn out in the vessel, and then analysed the gas. After the
  carbonic acid was separated, it appeared by the test of nitrous
  gas to contain nearly      of its original quantity of oxygen but
                              -J-                                             ;

                         a
  gen proved that      contained no sensible quantity of carburetted
                         it
hydrogen gas.
   It   isevident, then, that when        the safe-lantern the air gra
                                                 in
dually becomes contaminated with fire-damp, this fire-damp will
be consumed in the body of the lantern         and that the air passing
                                                       ;
through the chimney cannot contain any inflammable mixture.
  I   made      direct experiment on this point.
                a                                        gradually threw

above the lower aperture of the chimney; and the explosion
merely threw out 'from        itgust of foul air.

same principle as the first, except that instead of tubes, safely
canals are used, which consist of close concentric hollow me
tallic cylinders of different diameters, and placed together so as
to form circular canals of the diameter of from               to    of an
inch, and an inch and -ft long,                   by
                                            which air        admitted

much larger quantities than             by

        of lighting the Mines so as to prevent its Explosion,    453
 gaud lamps made on the same principle, the chimney being of
 glass covered with a metallic top containing the safety canals,
 and the air entering close to the flame through the circular
 canals.
     The third kind of safe lamp or lantern, and which is by far
 the most simple, is a close lamp or lantern into which the air is
-admitted, and from which it passes, through apertures covered
with brass wire gauze of -3-^ of an inch in thickness, the aper
 tures of which should not be more than -p^-j- of an inch ; this
stops explosions as well as long tubes or canals, and yet admits
 of a free draught of air.
     Having succeeded in the construction of safe-lanterns and
 lamps, equally portable with common lanterns and lamps, which
 afforded sufficient light, and which bore motion perfectly well,
 I submitted them individually to practical tests, by throwing
into them explosive atmospheres of fire-damp and air. By the
natural action of the flame drawing air through the air canals,
 from the explosive atmosphere, the light was uniformly extin
guished ; and when an explosive mixture was forcibly pressed
into the body of the lamp, the explosion was always stopped by
 the safety apertures, which may be said figuratively to act as a
sort of chemical fire sieves in separating flame from air. But I
 was not contented with these trials, and I submitted the safety-
canals, tubes, and wire gauze fire-sieves, to much more severe
 tests : I made them the medium of communication between a
large glass vessel filled with the strongest explosive mixture of
carburetted hydrogen and air, and a bladder £ or       i  full of the
same mixture, both insulated from the atmosphere.          By means
.of wires passing near the stop-cock of the glass vessel, 1 fired
 the explosive mixture in it by the discharge of a Leyden jar.
 The bladder always expanded at the moment the explosion was
 made ; a contraction as rapidly took place ; and a lambent flame
 played round the mouths of the safety apertures, open in the
 glass vessel ; but the mixture in the bladder did not explode:
 and by pressing some of it into the glass vessel, so as to make it
 replace the foul air, and subjecting it to the electric spark, re
 peated explosions were produced, proving the perfect security
 of the safety apertures; even when acted on by a much more
 powerful explosion than could possibly occur from the introduc
 tion of air from the mines.
     These experiments held good, whatever were the proportions
  of the explosive mixture and whatever was the size of the glass
 vessel, (no one was ever used containing more than a quart,)
                                                        \
  provided as many as 12 metallic tubes were used of of an inch
  in diameter, and 2| inches long ; or provided the circular me
  tallic canals were T'T of an inch in diameter, 1        of an inch
                                 F f3                           deep,

454      On the Fire-damp of Coal Mines, and on Methods
deep, and at least two inches in circumference ; or provided the
wire gauze had apertures of only Ti-^ of an inch.             When twelve
metallic tubes were employed as the medium of communication,
     of an inch in diameter and an inch long, the explosion was
communicated by them into the bladder.                 Four glass tubes of
the -f^i- of an inch in diameter and 2 inches long, did not com
 municate the explosion; but one of this diameter and length
 produced the effect. The explosion was stopped by a single tube
 .iig-* of an inch in diameter, when it was three inches long, but
 not when it was two inches long.
     The explosion was stopped by the metallic gauze of -5-^5- when
 it was placed between the exploding vessel and the bladder,
 though it did not present a surface of more than half a square
 inch, and the explosive mixture in the bladder in passing through
 it to supply the vacuum produced in the glass vessel, burnt on
 the surface exposed to the glass vessel for some seconds, pro
 ducing a murmuring noise.
      A circular canal -Ji- of an inch in diameter, and an inch and a
 half in circumference, and 1T'T of an inch deep, communi
  cated explosion ; but four concentric canals, of the same depth
  and diameter, and of which the smallest was two inches in
  diameter, and separated from each other only by their sides,
  which were of brass, and about -jtt °f an incrl 1{1 thickness, did
  not suffer the explosion to act through thein.
      It would appear then, that the smaller the circumference of
  the canal, that is, the nearer it approaches to a tube, the greater
  must be its depth, or the less its diameter to render it safe.
      I did not perceive any difference in these experiments, when
  the metals of the apertures were warmed by repeated explosions :
  it is probable, however, that considerable elevation of tempera
  ture would increase the power of the aperture to pass the ex
  plosion ; but the difference between the temperature of flame,
  and that marked on our common mercurial scale, is so great,
   that the addition of a few degrees of heat probably does not
   diminish perceptibly the cooling power of a metallic surface,
  with regard to flame.
       By diminishing the diameter of the air canals, their power of
  passing the explosion is so much diminished that their depth

 that oil lamps, in which the wick will always stand at the same
height, will be preferred.
  But the principle applies to                   every     kind of light, and its entire
 safety  is demonstrated.
    When the fire-damp          so mixed with the external atmosphere
                                    is
as to render       explosive, the light in the safe lantern or lamp will
                   it
 be extinguished, and warning will be given to the miners to
 withdraw from, and to ventilate that part of the mine.
   If   it be necessary to be in       part of the mine where the fire
                                              a

 be lighted        by
                 a fire made of charcoal, which burns without flame,
 or by   the steel -mill, though this does not afford such entire se
 curity from danger as the charcoal fire.
   It   is probable, that when explosions occur from the sparks
.from   the  steel -mill, the mixture of the fire-damp        in the pro       is
 portion required to consume all the oxygen of the air, for                                     it   is
 only in about this proportion th.it explosive mixtures can be fired

in the mixed gas, and the ventilation must be greater to free the
mine from the choke-damp so generated, than from the original
fire-damp.
    It does not appear, by what I have learnt from the miners,
that breathing an atmosphere containing a certain mixture of
fire-damp near or even at the explosive point, is attended with
any bad consequence.           I ascertained that a bird lived in a
mixture of equal parts of fire-damp and air ; but he soon began
to show symptoms of suffering.            I found a slight head-ache
produced     by breathing  for a few minutes an explosive mixture of
fire-damp and air; and if merely the health of the miners be
considered, the fire-damp ought always to be kept far below the
point of its explosive mixture.
    Miners sometimes are found alive in a mine after an explosion
has taken place : this is easily explained, when it is con
sidered that the inflammation is almost always limited to a
particular spot, and that it mixes the residual air with much
common air ; and supposing 1 of fire-damp to 13 W air to be
exploded, there will still remain nearly ^ of the original quantity of
 oxygen in the residual gas; and in some experiments,                made
 sixteen years ago, I found that an animal lived, though with
 suffering, for a short time, in a gas containing 100 parts of
 azote, fourteen parts of carbonic acid, and seven parts of ox
ygen.

    From my experiments it appears, that a mere narrow throat
and opening to the metallic part of the chimney, is sufficient to
prevent explosions from passing through the lamp, supposing
them possible ; but with the safety canals or metallic gauze in
the chimney the security is absolute.
    The circular canals and the apertures covered with metallic
gauze, are so much superior to tubes in practical application,
that I have no doubt of their being generally used ; I have
therefore given no sketch of the first safe lantern I had con
structed with tubes ; but substituting tubes for canals it is ex
actly the same as that represented fig. 1 .
                              Appendix.
    1.  In the beginning of my inquiries I had another close lantern
made, which may be called the fire-valve lantern.          In this, the
candle or lamp burns with its full quantity of air, admitted from
an aperture below, till the air begins to be mixed with fire
damp ; when, as the fire-damp increases the flame, a thermo-
metrical spring at the top of the lantern, made of brass and
steel, riveted together, and in a curved form, expands, moves
a valve in the chimney, diminishes the circulation of air, and
extinguishes the flame.       But I did not pursue this invention
after I had discovered the properties of the fire-damp, on which
the safe lantern is founded.
    2. The safety of close lamps or lanterns may probably be like
wise secured by sieves made of asbestus, or possibly even hair
                                                                      Or

be necessary above in the chimney.         I have little doubt but that
windows of fine metallic gauze may be used for giving light in
lanterns, with perfect security ; perhaps for the chimney it may
be worth while to have fine silver plated wire gauze made.
     3. The expansive powers of the fire-damp during its explosion
 are so small as to render no precautions, with respect to the
thickness of the glass or horn in the lamps or lanterns, necessary.
LXXK1II.        On Safe-Lamps   for Coal Mir.es ; with a Description
     of the one invented    by  Mr. Stephenson, of Killingworlh
     Colliery.   .

                            To  Mr. Tillnck.
Sir, — On        Tuesday, the 5th of December, a very numerous
meeting of the members of the Literary and Philosophical
Society at Newcastle-upon-Tyne took place, in consequence of
an intimation that some safe-lamps, intended to warn miners
 of the presence of inflammable air, were to be exhibited ; and a
 memoir read on the same interesting subject, which had been
 kindly transmitted by its author,Dr. Murray of Edinburgh. On this
occasion several viewers and other gentlemen connected with
 the coal trade attended.        The first lamp produced was that
 contrived by Dr. Clanny, brought by the inventor in person. Of
 this machine, with its bellows, water-cisterns, jack and chain,
 little need be said, the Philosophical Transactions having intro
 duced it to public notice ; but though the Doctor's lamp is unfit
for the use of the coal-miner while at work, and equally so when
traversing the narrow and frequently obstructed galleries of a
 colliery, yet much praise is certainly due to the individual who
was the first to dedicate his time, besides spending some money,
on a project intended solely for the benefit and protection of a
class of men with which he was in no way particularly con
cerned.
     Mr. William Brandling's lamp nest occupied the attention of
the meeting : it resembles a common lantern in size and shape,
with a pair of double bellows fixed on the top, to free it from
the air exhausted of oxygen by combustion, and a flexible tube
to reach to the floor of the mine, where carburetted hydrogen is
less likely to be met with than nearer the roof.          To this con
trivance    the  objection was, that  without great  care in managing
the bellows, the light might be easily extinguished ; the tube
also appeared to be an unnecessary incumbrance.
    Of Sir H. Davy's and and Dr. Murray's lamps nothing need
be said, descriptions of them having been printed in some of
                                                                    the

                 On Safe-Lamps     for   Coal M'irtes.            459
the philosophical journals of last month ; but I shall speak in
detail of one produced by a Mr. Stephenson, engine-wright at
Killingworth Colliery, which met with universal approbation.
This is a small copper lamp, of a semi-globular form, with an
outer case of the same shape : round the lower part of this case
are numerous small holes, by which the air is admitted, and after
passing between the two eases, escapes through a circle of similar
orifices surrounding the wick, and feeds the flame : this simple
apparatus is covered with a glass chimney, which fixes in a rim
so as to be rendered air-tight, and the chimney protected by a
tin covering pierced full of holes, at once to emit light and save
the glass from external injury.       In this manner combustion is
carried on while the air is sufficiently pure for its support ; but no
sooner is it contaminated by carburetted hydrogen up to the
firing point than the flame gradually dies out without explosion ;
 and should the inflammable gas he precipitated down the chim
 ney by any unforeseen accident, the azotic gas accumulated
 above the flame is found equal to extinguish it.       The height of
 this lamp, of which the inclosed correct though rough drawing
 (Plate VIII. fig. 11) will convey a just idea, is twelve inches,
 and cost under five shillings.     Of its great utility in places of
 danger, the following experiment seemed to carry the strongest
 conviction to every practical miner present.          A quantity of
 carburetted hydrogen, obtained from a blower in Killingworth
 Colliery, was pressed from a bladder so as to enter through the
 small holes near the bottom of the lamp, the contents of another
 bladder being discharged into a gasometer inverted at the same
 time over the chimney : the flame in the lamp gradually died
 away, as was the case in a previous trial, and without the gas above
 it being inflamed ; but no sooner was a candle introduced into
 the gasometer than an explosion took place.
     From what has been already said, together with the inclosed
 section, an invention nearly similar to Sir H. Davy's will be
 immediately recognised ; but that it has not been pirated from
 that gentleman is a fact known to most of the mine owners
 here ; for on the 3d of November the Reverend Mr. Hodgeu
 t'f Haworth, and Dr. Grey of Wearmouth, communicated to a
 very full meeting of the coal trade held at the Assembly-rooms,
 the contents of letters just received by them from Sir Humphry,
 reciting the particulars of his newly-invented safe-lamps ; and to
 the same company Mr. R. Lambert, chief agent for Killingworth
  and other mines on this river, mentioned the discovery made hy
 Stephenson, who is employed by him as an engine-wright,
  observing, at the same time, that his lamp had. been taken into
  the pits, and found to answer the intended purpose.        Sir Hum

pbry Davy's discovery    flowed from science judiciously applied.
Stephenson's discovery appears to have resulted from trials made
below ground ; for, though an excellent mechanic and acute
man, he is unacquainted with the science of chemistry.    Thus a
great object has been obtained in rendering the occupation of
the coal miner in this part of the kingdom less hazardous from
the dreadful effects of inflammable air ; and I hope you will not
think the pages of your valuable journal misapplied in giving pub
licity to a contrivance, by which the lives of hundreds may be
saved in other coal-mining districts, as well as on the banks of
Tyne and Wear.

Sir,—   H aaing observed with pleasure for several months     past,
in the Philosophical Magazine, a statement of the duty per
formed by the different sorts of engines at work pumping water
out of the mines in Cornwall       and presuming that the effect
                                     ;
must have been to excite a more general interest in favour of
AVoolf 's engines ; we transmit for insertion copies of two certifi
cates from the agents of the mines where they are at work ; to
which it seems needful to add, that the very great quantity of
coal represented to be saved by the use of Woolf's engine at
Wheal Vor, is in some measure to be attributed to the indifferent
state of the one pumping water on Boulton and Watt's plan.

Oatfield, and Abraham Mines, in the county of Cornwall, do
hereby certify, that an engine erected on that part of the afore
said mine called Wheal Abraham, on Mr. WoolPs patent prin
ciple, the large cylinder of which being forty-five inches diameter
has been working for the last fourteen months drawing water
from a depth of 190 fathoms, with a load for the first ten months
of upwards of sixteen pounds per square inch, and lor the last
four months about fifteen pounds per square inch ; that the said
engine has executed her work far leyond our most sanguine
expectations ; and we can with pleasure state, that the engine
during the first ten months exceeded the average effect of
Boulton and Watt's engines in this county as thirty-four to
twenty ; and during the last four months considerably above two
to one, or as forty-seven to twenty.      We also consider an engine
on Mr. Woolf's principle less liable to hinderment than an
engine on any other principle we have yet seen.

but is equal to what is above stated, calculated on the superficies
of the large piston.

                      wall with each Bushel of Coals.
 w      e find that the Table given in our number for August last,
 p. 11S, of work performed by the steam-engines in Cornwall, is
 s.till misunderstood by some of our readers, as are also the notices
 <>u the same subject given in the numbers since published.              The
 first column gives        the  months, viz. August, September,         &c. ;
 the second coutains the number of engines reported in each
month ; the third gives the whole quantity of coals consumed
 during the month by all the engines reported ; the fourth is the
sum of the work performed by the engines reported, with one
 lushel of coals each: for example, in August 1811, the first
month reported, eight engines, each using one bushel of coals,
lifted 126,126,000 one foot high, one-eighth of which quantity
is the average work of these eight engines.             If the whole quan
tity    of water  raised   one foot  high  by  the whole   quantity of coals
consumed by       the  eight engines    be  required,  then  the number of
pounds in the fifth column, which is the work of every bushel
 (on an average of the eight engines reported) , must be multiplied
by the number of bushels expressed in the 3d column.                 Thus in
August     1811,   the average   work   of eight engines    was 15,760,000
pounds lifted one foot high by one bushel of coals: and these
pounds multiplied by 23,661 bushels would give for the whole
quantity of water lifted one foot high by all the coals consumed
during the month 372,897,360,000 pounds — and so of the rest
of the months in the Table: but this would be only an approxi
mation to truth ; for some engines work more days in a month
than others, and those as well as the engines consuming the
greatest or least quantity of coals may chance to be sometimes
the better and sometimes the worse engines of the number re
ported. The third column in the Table was no way necessary
zo its construction      ;  it was inserted merely    as a piece  of curious
information respecting the general consumption of coals in
Cornwall.        But, in fact, the title of the fourth column was in-         ,
accurately expressed.          To save trouble in future references, .we
again    insert  the  Table, but now brought down to November in
clusive.

   4Q4                    On Steam Boilers.
      During the last month (November), according to Messrs. Leans'
   Report, Woolf's engine at Wheal Vor consumed 1 154 bushels
   of coals, and with each bushel lifted 50,445,150 pounds of water
   one foot high; and his engine at Wheal Abraham during the
  same month consumed 1044 bushels of coals, and lifted, with
  each bushel, 52,^27,4000 pounds, one foot high.
   LXXXVI.       On Boilers employed       to produce    Sleam   of High
     Pressure.    By T.    Gill,  Esq.    one  of   Ike Chairmen   of the
      Society for  the Encouragement      of  Arts,   Manufactures and
      Commerce.
                             To  Mr.  Tilloch.
  Sir, —   I  was much pleased with the judicious remarks con
  tained in your last number, on the lamentable accident in Well-
  street, Goodman's Fields, occasioned by exposing a close boiler
  to so high a temperature as to cause an explosion attended with
  and followed by such fatal consequences.             If the makers of
  boilers that are to be employed in producing steam of high pres
  sure do not adopt those precautions which shall preclude the
  possibility of such accidents, they will deter all prudent people
  from the use of this invaluable agent.      Already this has been the
  case with respect to  the  use of  Toco-motive     engines on some of
  the rail-ways, in consequence of the explosion of that at New-
 bottle Colliery, alluded to in your last number, and which was
 occasioned by a culpable obstinacy which caused the death of
 the engineer and several other people.         Some years ago, when
 a high pressure engine     near  Woolwich     was   burst by the steam,
 the mischief was owing to similar madness — the wilful ob
 struction of the safety valve to prevent the possibility of steam
 escaping ! After the last-mentioned         accident, several effectual
 means to prevent such accidents were contrived by Mr. Trevi-
 thick (who first brought the high-pressure engines into use). In
 the first place, he proposed inclosing the safety-valve in such a
 manner that no one could get access to it to increase the load
 beyond that intended ; and secondly, in addition to the recurved
tube with mercury (which can be adjusted with precision to anv
pressure intended to be employed, and will blow out before the
steam, when the pressure rises even a single pound higher) he
drilled a hole in the boiler, which he plugged up with lead, at
such a height from the bottom, that the boiler could never boil
dry without exposing the lead to be melted; and consequently,
making an opening for the steam, which by its escape into the
fire extinguishes it.    This contrivance is calculated to prevent

                    Hints   on the Localities of Coal.            465
 the bursting of the boiler by forcing cold water into it when
 allowed by carelessness to become dry, and to get red hot. Metal
 plugs should always be riveted into such boilers. They should be
 made of a fusible mixture, that will melt whenever the contents
 of the boiler attain a certain degree of heat. This should never
 be omitted, even when the boiler is of the best form, which cer
 tainly is that contrived by Mr. Woolf.        Indeed, I think it im
 possible  to conceive  any  other arrangement for a boiler possess
 ing equal strength and durability, and consequently, safety.      As
 it would appear that some of these safeguards are not so ge
 nerally known as they ought to be, you may, perhaps, render
 some service to the community       by giving them a place in your
 Useful miscellany.
                     I am, sir,
                                Your most obedient servant,

             LXXXVII. Hints      on the Localities of Coal.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sra, — As     a spirit of inquiry has lately been excited on the
subject of the various localities of coal, the following brief no
tices of the different formations or sets of rocky strata among
which it has been detected in the north-east of England, may
afford amusement to such of your readers as pay attention to geo
logical facts, and some useful information to those who suspect
that this. valuable fossil may lie concealed under beds of stone
found on their own estates or royalties.
     1st. Tolerably good seams of coal are spread over that part of
 Northumberland situated north of the Coquet and west of By-
well on the Tyne, with the exception of the porphyritic and
 grau wacke mountains forming the Cheviots : — here it alternates
 with sandstones, shales, and blue encrinal limestone, and over
lying masses or mountain caps of basalt are scattered over the
 whole country.      As the limestone stretches from the sea-shore
 towards the south-west, and rises into the chain of mountains
 which reach from Northumberland to Derbyshire, the seams di
 minish in thickness, and the coal consists chiefly of carbon and
sulphur with a very small proportion of bitumen.          Such is the
 crow coal of Alston    Moor.
     2d. The Newcastle coal formation measures 58 miles from
 Acklington in Northumberland to Cockfield in Durham, and
 24 miles from the sea-coast at Tynemouth to the neighbourhood
  of Bywell. Its strata comprise sandstones and shales, with oc-

of that rock, are here to      be found.     This formation is evidently
of fresh-water origin, for marine exuviae do not occur in it ; but
the impressions of ferns, reeds, and fresh-water muscles are met
with in every colliery. The magnesian or Sunderland limestone
next succeeds, containing casts of fish, encrinites, flustrae, and
other productions of the ocean, but no bed of coal or coal mea
sures alternate with it.
    3d. The red calcareous sandstone with masses of gypsum,
 over which the Tees flows from the vicinity of Croftbridge, was
 bored for coal at Dinsdale to the depth of 54 fathoms, but no
 seam worth working detected.
    4th. The alum shale of the Yorkshire moorlands is covered
 by a thin coal formation, and some of the schistose rocks ac
 companying the coal envelop casts of ammonites, pectinites, &e.
 Jet coating mineralized wood in the manner of bark is also
 found in the alum shale itself.
    5th. On the Lincolnshire coast, fragments of a black coal,
 but resembling that of Bovey in texture, are washed on shore, to
 gether with an ash-gray bituminous shale containing numerous
 sea-shells; and several beds of the same shale have been bored
 through near Louth, in search of a seam worth working, but
 without success. The, hard chalk forming the Wolds rests im
 mediately on this 6et of strata.

            LXXXVIII.       Proceedings   of Learned    Societies.
                             ROYAL SOCIETY.
 Nov. 30.    Anniversary. — On             the Copleyan      medal being
 adjudged to Dr. Brewster by the President and Council of the
 Royal Society, it was delivered to Mr. Troughton, his proxy,
 with a suitable address from the President.              This discourse
 proved that, however time and disease may have affected his
 corporeal powers, they have not been able to assail his mental
 faculties, and his capacious mind still retains that native vigour
 whicji once carried it around the globe.         Sir Joseph, in his usual
 perspicuous manner,      took   a concise  retrospect of the recent dis
 coveries in physical optics ; he described with equal simplicity

                            Royal Society.
and accuracy the modifications of light discovered by Maim, and
the altered direction of rays, in consequence of passing through
certain crystals, which, having much analogy to magnetic
phaenomena, has been called polarization.           He next took a
review of the numerous experiments and discoveries of Dr.
Brewster, observing that few of the other fellows of the Society
had contributed an equal number of curious papers in so short a
period ; and in brief but very comprehensive terms unfolded the
singular results and important consequences of this indefatigable
philosopher's labours, which have appeared in the Philosophical
Transactions. Such of the noblemen and prelates who are
fellows of this society and omitted attending on this occasion,
lost an opportunity not to be regained, of easily acquiring a distinct
knowledge of a very curious and interesting branch of science,
which has lately engaged the attention of philosophers in all
countries, and which may ultimately be brought to administer
to the comforts, amusements, or conveniences of persons in
opulent life. The Right Hon. President, in conclusion, ad
dressed himself to Mr. Troughton, charging him to convey to
their absent fellow, Dr. B. the sentiments of the Council, their
high sense of the value and importance of his labours, and in
their name and in that of the Society to urge him to persevere in
his experiments, to continue his researches in that branch of
physical optics which he had chosen, and in which he had been
so signally successful.   Lastly, he observed, " how gratifying it
must be to be praised by those who are themselves so worthy of
 praise!" and that no higher stimulus could be offered to a
philosopher, than that now given by the decision of the Council
in adjudging this medal, and an expression of the sentiments
which influenced that decision. — Afterwards the Society pro
ceeded to the choice of a Council and Officers for the ensuing
year, when on examining the lists, it appeared that the following
getUlemen were elected: —
    Of the Old Council. —The Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks,

     After the election the members of the Society dined togethery,
as usual; at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand.
     Dec. 7. — The President in the chair. A short paper by Dr;
Reid Clanny was read, containing an account of some recent
experiments made with his lamp in coal-mines, when their at
mosphere was in a highly combustible state, being saturated
with carburetted hvdrogen gas. In this communication, which
Dr. C. calls a Supplement to his paper in the Phil. Trans.
 1813, the author narrates the dreadful events which have
occurred in the different coal-mines since that period, when he
first proposed his lamp as a protection to miners. Jrle notices
the increased number of such calamities in consequence of the.
increasing extent of the mines, and adds that, nevertheless, his
lamp had not been tried ! One alleged that ventilation was the
best protection ; but this is impossible where the mine, as often
happens, has only one shaft. Another, that the lamp was liable.
 to be broken by the fall of pieces or stones from the roof.       Ta
 remove this objection, he had a lamp constructed of glass so
 thick and strong that a ton weight falling on it could not break
 it.. He likewise made it so portable that it may be carried in a
 great coat pocket. Still he has been unable to get it introduced
 into practice, or even fairly tried, although it has received the
 approbation of all the scientific men who have seen it.         Even
 till vely lately (in the month of October only) he could not obtain
 a favourable opportunity of making himself a fair experiment
 with his lamp, in a coal-mine saturated with fire-damp.          Dr.
  C. gives an instance of persons either evading or declining to
 make an experiment with his lamp, although he lives in the
 vicinity of coal-mines. Ultimately, he has succeeded, through
 the beneficent exertions of Mr. Holmes, in making two different
 experiments in mines which were in a highly combustible state,
  and where the presence of a common lamp must have been at
  tended with instant ruin.      One of these experiments was made
 in rather a perilous situation, in the chamber of a mine 100
 fathoms below the surface of the earth, and where the air was so
 inflammable that a common lamp must have blown up the mine :
 but with Dr. C.'s lamp no danger whatever occurred, and all
  persons remained in perfect safety.       In these experiments, at
  mospheric air was first thrown into the lamp by means of the
 bellows : carburetted hydrogen was then added till a slight ex
  plosion took place within the lamp, which was then extinguished,
  without affecting the circumambient air, which was highly in
  flammable.      These  satisfactory and  successful results are  at
                                                                tested

                               Fire-damp.                          469
 tested by the signatures of        Holmes, Esq. the superintendents
 and experienced      miners present.     In a P.S. Dr. C. assigns a
 cause for the occasional extinction of his lamp, from the irregu
 larity of throwing in the necessary supply of air ; but he has also
 improved the machinery for blowing the bellows, which can now
 be wound up to act above thirty hours.
     Dec. 9. — A mathematical paper by Mr. Herschel was laid
 before the Society, but it was of a nature not to be read.         On
 this evening, and on
     Dec. 21, — Part of a paper by Dr. Brewster was read, de
 tailing a series of experiments on the effects of heat on transpa
 rent bodies, and their consequent production of pencils of
 colours.    These experiments are deemed interesting to the
 chemist, mineralogist, and persons who amuse themselves with
experiments in natural philosophy.         The results of these expe
 riments were detailed in propositions.         The first proposition
.stated, that bv heating plates of glass in wat^r, they'yielded, ac
 cording to their thickness, all the series of colours described by
 Newton, one falling short of another so as to give the regular
 series.   Glass was crystallized into parallelopipedons by heating
.on iron bars, and these crystals gave coloured fringes.          The
 reading was postponed till a future meeting, and the Society
 adjourned till Jan. 11, 1816.
         LXXXIX.      Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles,
                               FIRE-DAMP.
 1 he friends     of humanity will rejoice that means have at length
 been devised, which promise effectual security against the recur
 rence of those dreadful explosions of fire-damp in coal-miiies,
 which have occurred so often within these few years.
     In a recent volume of the Philosophical Transactions an ac
 count is given of Dr. Clanny's lamp contrived for this purpose.
 We need not here repeat the nature of the construction.           It is
 but justice to say, that it was verv ingenious, arid with proper
 care and management seemed calculated to answer the desired
  end: nor could we allow the objections that have been urged
  against it, on the score of complexity, to have such force as to
  prevent its adoption — if more simple and equally efficacious
  means had not since been devised.
     At a late meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society
  at Newcastle,      a paper was      read, describing a new lamp
  invented by     Dr.  Murray    of Edinburgh, intended to prevent
  explosions.    It is described as a close lamp furnished with a
                                 Gg3                           flexible

470
flexible tube reaching to the floor of the mine — on the prihcipJ*
that the inflammable gas, being lighter than the atmospheric air,
will be found to occupy the higher station : but in fact, the
fire-damp is often disengaged from below ; which is a sufficient
objection (were there no other) to the use of this lamp.
    Another lamp invented by W. Brandling, Esq. was also ex
amined by the Society, which, if there were now any necessity,
might be used for exploring dangerous places with safety. The
 azote disengaged by the combustion is drawn out by double
bellows connected with the top ; and fresh air in consequence
rushes in throngh a flexible tube attached to the bottom of the
lamp, and of sufficient length to reach a current of pure air.
    In our last we gave a brief account of Sir H. Davy's safe-
lamp, and in our present number we have been enabled to lay
his communication to the Royal Society, in an entire state, be
fore our readers — a circumstance that will prove gratifying to
several correspondents, who had expressed great anxietv to have
such information on the subject as might enable them to apply
it to practice.
    We have been favoured with a description of another safe-
lamp. also inserted in the present number, invented by a Mr.
Stephenson of Killingworth Colliery.       In principle it is some
what similar to Sir H. Davy's^ and, considered as the invention
of a man of humble pretensions, has considerable merit, though
much inferior in construction to Sir Humphry's.       It is rather a
curious coincidence, that two lamps at all approximating each
other in the means resorted to for obtaining the desired object,
should have been brought forward bv different inventors ; for we
have every reason to believe that Mr. Stephenson's as well as
Sir II. Davy's invention was perfectly original.       The experi
ments with Mr. Stephenson's lamp are, to a certain extent, sa
tisfactory ; but, if we have rightly understood the communica
tion of our correspondent, the absolute safety of the lamp was
not proved by them ; for pure Jire-damp appears to have been
thrown into it, which we know does extinguish flame; whereas
an explosive mixture should have been thrown in.
    We have seen Sir Humphry's lamp.         He has succeeded in
bringing it to a state of absolute security. This we saw proved
by a variety of experiments, in which the most explosive mix
tures that could be formed were thrown into
                                                It it,
                                                     and the effect
invariably was, the extinction of the flame.          impossible to
                                                     is
conceive any lamp more easy to be kept in order, while at the
same time  it    as simple as any common portable lamp.
                is
    Thus have the public been put in possession of contrivance
                                                         a
which was long desideratum, and which, not many months ago,
                     a
was ranked among those objects which, hqwever desirable, could

              Fire-damp.   — Geology. — New      Book.              471
hardly be hoped to be attained.           We have seen, and with re
gret, a most illiberal communication in the Tyne Mercury,
charging SirH. Davy with having pirated Dr. Clanny's lamp
(described in the Philosophical Transactions, and with keeping
the Doctor's name out of view, in his communication made to
the Royal Society.        Now the fact  is,   that Sir Humphry made
very handsome mention of the Doctor's name in the communi
cation alluded to.        As to the charge of piracy :— excepting the
circumstance of both having a wick (in common with all oil
lamps) the two contrivances are not nearly so similar as        a  blast
furnace and an air-furnace.          Indeed they are much more re
mote from each other. — The Doctor rests the safety of his lamp
on the intervention of water to prevent the transmission of
 ignition, and supplies the air required to maintain the flame           by
 means of bellows.        Sir Humphry rests the safety of his lamp on
 quitea    different  principle — the non-conducting power of tubes,
 or of apertures below a     given size, to transmit ignition, even when
 filled with the inflammable gas and in contact with flame or,      ;
 in other words, — on the power which small apertures possess
 to extinguish inflamed gas; and the air required to maintain
 combustion   is    supplied, as in a common Argand's lamp,              by
 passing through (properly adapted) apertures at the bottom,
 without the intervention of any liquid.
      As to those pseudo philosophers who take upon them to as
 sert (probably because the fact, simple as    it   is,   isbeyond their
 comprehension) that Sir H. Davy's lamp will not anwser, we
 can offer them no consolation.         For ourselves, we seek no better
 evidence that the sun will rise to-morrow morning, than its hav
 ing regularly done so all the yesterdays that are past.
