4.      Mr. T. R. Edmonds       on the   Law of Human Mortality
or the other of the two ways just mentioned. The direct method,
by observing the number of survivors at particular ages out of a
given number living at birth-time, or out of a given number
living at any other age, is applicable chiefly to selected classes
 distinct from the general population of a nation or district,
 such as classes of persons on whose lives annuities or assu
rances have been granted for money by trading companies            or by
 governments.
    The most common method of observation, by observing the
 rate of decrement at every age, is indirect, and is the only method
 used for determining the law of mortality, according to age, of
 the total population of a nation, or of the constituent parts of
 such population distinguished as village, town, or city population.
 Observations according to this method are made by periodical
enumerations of the numbers living and the numbers who have
 died in annual, quinquennial, or decennial intervals of age.
 The ratios of the numbers dying to the numbers living (which
are the rates of decrement of life) are thus obtained for every
age.    These rates being known, the consequent Table of morta
lity representing survivors at every year of age may be deduced
by calculation.
    The law of human mortality may be most simply expressed by
means of the rates of decrement and the relation between these
rates at different ages.     If at  two known ages the rates of decre
ment are ao and at, then,      if the rate of decrement at one age is
known, the rate of decrement at the other age may be found from
the proportion
                                           I

                                    a+t
wherein t is the difference of age, a is a constant representing
distance (in time or age) from a fixed point, which is the ideal
zero  of life or vital force, and              hyperbolic logarithm of
                                     } is the
10, and equal to 2-302585.         There are two ideal zeros of human
life—one belonging to the period of childhood, and the other to
the period of manhood.         The curve which indicates the law of
decrease of human life consists of two branches—one on each side
of the period of puberty.       There apparently exists a short inter
mediate branch at or near the junction of the two others. The
existence of such short branch may be due to the differences of
age at which puberty is attained by different individuals.
    The complete expression for the law of human mortality is
contained in two similar formulae,        one for the period of increase
of vital force, extending from birth to the age of about 9 years;
the other for the period of decrease of vital force, extending from

                                expressed by a New Formula.                                        -                   ‘5
the    age   of about 12 years to the end of life.
                                               Both formulae are
similar to the formula which has been shown to represent the
law, according to temperature, of the elastic force of steam of
maximum density, and the formula which has been shown to
represent the law of density of saturated steam (Philosophical
Magazine, March and July 1865). All four formulae are deduced
—from a differential of the form following:—
                                d.log P==(1+
                                                              !);          dt.
   In  the two formulae for human life, the quantity      represents

 6         Mr. T. R. Edmonds    on the  Law of Human Mortality
  observations made on the population of England, the point of
 junction of the two periods is very near the age 9 years and 4
 months from birth-time. But in seven out of eight of the
 Tables of comparison hereunto annexed, the column which
 exhibits the results of the new formula is taken from a Table in
 which the period of childhood is assumed to terminate at the
  age of 9 complete years, and the period of manhood to commence
 at 12 years of age.      The rate of mortality or rate of decrement
 of  life, in the intermediate period from 9 to 12 years of age, has
 been assumed -to be constant and at a minimum of -0055 per
               -
                    5 . ..
 annum, or            in time dt.
    The two branches of the curve indicating the law of decrease
 of human life (before 9 and after 12 years of age) bear a simple
 relation to one another. If the abscissae of the two curves,
 between the zeros of life and the ages of minimum mortality,
 be divided into the same number of equal parts, the logarithms
 of the corresponding ordinates are to one another in a fixed pro
 portion, that of 1 to 8 very nearly.      If the period of childhood,
 extending from –24 years to +9 years of age, be divided into
 15 equal parts of 9 months each, and the period of manhood,
 extending from 12 to 102 years of age, be divided into the same
number of equal parts, each of 6 years, in that case the rate of
mortality will decrease in any one of the 15 equal intervals into
which the period of childhood is divided, exactly eight times as
fast as the rate of mortality in the corresponding interval of
manhood increases.         The vital force being inversely as the rate
of  mortality,   it ensues that the increase of vital force in passing
through any interval of 9 months in the period of childhood is
exactly counterbalanced by a decrease of vital force in passing
through the corresponding interval of 6 years in the period of
manhood.         The existence of the relations now mentioned
between the two branches of the curve of life, renders it unne
cessary to make separate calculations by the new formula for
the values of log P in both curves; for when log P is known
for one curve, it is known for the other curve also, by the use
of a constant multiplier, as may be seen on reference to Table III.
hereunto annexed.        On reference to Table II. hereunto annexed,
it will also be seen, at each of 15 intervals of age, how nearly
the rates of decrement in the period of childhood resemble those
of corresponding ages in the period of manhood, according to
the English Life Table No. 3 for males.
    The only good observations in the rates of decrement, accord
ing to age, prevailing in the general population of a nation are
those which have been made in Sweden and in England.              The
Swedish observations commence with the         year 1749;  the English

                                expressed by a New Formula.                                         7
observations with the year 1813.      Both series of observations,
with insignificant interruptions, have been continued to the pre
 sent year (1866).
   The method of observation in both series has been substan
tially the same. In Sweden and in England there have been
made periodical enumerations of the living and dying, in quin
quennial intervals of age, from the age of 5 years upwards, and
in annual intervals for ages below five years. The Swedish ob
servations have been satisfactorily made, judging from the
internal evidence of correctness afforded by uniformity of                                         in
crease of ratios of dying to living for consecutive quinquennial
intervals of age.   Similar success has not attended the English
observations for   quinquennial   intervals of age; for the several
indicated rates of  mortality  for even quinquennial intervals of
age ending at the ages 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 years are nearly
as great as the several indicated rates of mortality for odd quin
quennial intervals of age, five years greater, ending at the ages
35, 45, 55, 65, and 75 years.      This will be seen on reference
to column 5 in Table WI. hereunto annexed.          The amount of
erroris considerable, and remains unaccounted for. The English
 Life Tables Nos. 2 and 3 are founded on these observations, cor
rected by the assumption that the errors are in opposite direc
tions and neutralize one another, the true rate of mortality
being assumed to be halfway between consecutive contradictory
quinquennial rates.       The publication of the numbers dying in
quinquennial intervals of age ceased with the year 1850, the
 intervals of age now adopted for publication being decennial for
Ages exceeding 25 years.
    On comparison of the rates of mortality for quinquennial inter.
 vals of age, of the male population of Sweden and England (the
 former for 61 years, and the latter for 7 years), it will be found
that, according to the general average for          ages exceeding   all                           25
years, the Swedish rates exceed the English rates             the same              at

this formula.    The coincidence, at this period of life, which
establishes the truth of the new formula, establishes at the same
time the great credit for accuracy due to the English observa
tions at periods of life in which the returns are not affected by
the disposition of the people to understate or overstate their
ages.
   Comparing the observations of Sweden in the present century
with the observations of Sweden and Finland in the previous
century, there is found in the more recent observations a consi
derable decrease in the mortality at   ages under 20 years, and  all
a considerable increase     the mortality      inages above 30                at    all
years.  Both sets                   of

14      Mr. T. R. Edmonds                           on the    Law of Human Mortality
from 75 to 85 years.       The appearances presented are not, how
ever, inconsistent with the truth of the new formula.        To recon
cile the new formula with the facts, it will suffice to make the
reasonable supposition that the position of the ideal zero of life
in the period of manhood is variable in the different classes con
stituting the total populations observed, say from the age 105
years for village population to the age 95 years for city population.
    In addition to the new formula, by which the law of human
mortality, according to age, may be expressed, there exists an
old formula by means of which the mortality at            ages may                     all                       be
equally well expressed—with this difference only, that the new
formula fails for ages exceeding 85 years, whilst the old formula
fails for ages under     years. Both formulae may

indicated by the “Carlisle Table” of Mr. Joshua Milne, con
structed in 1815. The latter Table was deduced from observa
tions of Dr. Heysham, on the general population of both sexes
in the town of Carlisle during the nine years ending with 1787,
and is now eommonly used in England as the measure of the
mortality according to age of selected lives. The Table previ
ously used for that purpose was one specially applicable to selected
lives, which was deduced by M. Deparcieux from observations
on the mortality, according to age, of persons of both sexes
selected as nominees in French Tontines. The Tontine Life Table
of M. Deparcieux, as well as his Life Tables for various commu
mities of monks and nuns, was published in the year 1746.
Mr. Milne writes thus of these Life Tables of M. Deparcieux:—
“They are among the most curious and correct, and of the best
authority that have yet been published.”        The law of mortality
for select life differs considerably from that for general life, espe
cially for the period extending from the age 20 to the age 50
years. The mortality increases with the age during this period
much more slowly in select life than it does in general life. The
following Table of “Expectation,” or mean duration of future
life, in years, at seven different ages, according to the three Tables
above referred              to,
                      will show how greatly these Tables resemble

   The theoretical Table of “City Mortality’ above mentioned is
represented nearly by the mortality, according to age, observed
in the male population of English towns or cities of the first
magnitude, with the exception, however, of Liverpool and                                                Man

to age, observed by M. Duparcieux among monks in the con

    Having been provided, by the kindness of Sir John Barton,
 with two grooved plates of glass containing 500 divisions in an
inch,  I  was enabled to examine the fringes on the paragenic
spectra    under different circumstances. '
   When the grooved surfaces of the plates were placed in con
tact, and the grooves formed a small angle with one another,
the middle or principal image, A (fig. 4), when observed with a
lens whose anterior focus coincided with the grooves, had no
bands, but the paragenic spectra a, c, b, d on each side had
numerous serrated bands or fringes perpendicular to the direc
tion of the grooves, the number on the first spectra a, b being
at the rate of 19 in an inch of the luminous disk, and increasing
in arithmetical progression.
   When the luminous object is rectangular, and the rectangular
paragenic spectra are brought nearly into contact, as at a b and
c d (fig.      5),
             the bands,       seen    nearly

They are seen both at a perpendicular incidence and when the
plates are inclined in a plane parallel to the grooves.

 are wider or fewer in an inch.

   6. They appear like minute black lines upon the colourless
image, but when their magnitude is increased, they appear like
blue   or pink bands on a ground of a different colour, which is
generally white or whitish blue.

   When the spectra had suffered three, four, five, or six re
flexions, the central and other images were covered with the
same number of bands as with two reflexions from the grooved
steel; but another series of wider bands was superposed.

of climate which have been proved to result from excentricity.
The values have been determined at epochs 50,000 years apart.
From the extreme slowness with which the excentricity changes,
it was not deemed necessary for our purpose to determine them
at shorter intervals.     The longitude of the perihelion is given
merely to show the great irregularity of the motion of the
major axis.        -
   We have    already  stated it as our opinion that the glacial epoch
of the geologist was the period beginning about 240,000 years
ago and extending down till about 80,000 years ago (‘Reader,’
October 14, December 2 and 9).          The time of the greatest cold
would be about 200,000 or 210,000 years ago.
   It will be seen from an inspection of the Table that the next
                                                 i.
glacial epoch prior to this occurred about 750,000 years ago.
At that time the excentricity was exactly equal to what it was
210,000 years ago.       Going          50,000 years further, we find
the  excentricity  to be  only  0:0132.    But 50,000 years still fur
ther back, viz. 850,000 years ago, the excentricity almost reached
 itssuperior limit.         quite possible that this, and not 200,000
                                 It   is
years ago, may have been the period           the boulder-clay.    Pro

           at                                 reached the high value
of  0-0517.     Here             we
                           have three glacial epochs following each
 other      close succession—or rather,

        IV.       On the determination of the Disgregation of a Body, and on
                 the True Capacity for Heat.   By Professor CLAUSIUsl.

        IN Equivalence of Transformations to Internal Work”.t, I in
        troduced into the theory of heat a new quantity having refer
        ence to the arrangement of the particles of a body, and which                                                                                    I.
        called the disgregation of the body.      This quantity serves to
        express the total quantity of work which heat can do when the
        particles of the body undergo changes of arrangement at differ-.
        ent temperatures.    Let us suppose that the body undergoes an
        infinitely small change of state, the change being such that it is
        reversible, and              by

  In an exposition of the mechanical theory of heat recently
published by M. Paul de Saint-Robert+, this talented author
expresses the opinion that the difference insisted on by me

agreewith his reasoning, and in my opinion the simplifications
which he has introduced into the formulae, by means of this rea
soning, are not generally admissible.
   M. de Saint-Robert supposes that if the free space afforded
to the body is very large, the body will be reduced at           tem                                      all

of Professor Rankine                        as to the true capacity
                                             of bodies for heat.
Professor Rankine considers that the true   capacity  for heat of
the same body can have different values when the states of
aggregation of the body are different; whereas I, on the other
hand, have given my reasons for supposing that the true capa
city of a body for heat must be the same in     states    aggre                  all               of

   M.          de
           Saint-Robert now makes this same supposition, that
the capacity             of
                   body for heat    the same under       states, and                    all

consequently that the quantity       heat which    body   contains              a                              is
proportional                   its
                    absolute temperature; but instead

Now, since udv-H way+wdz is strictly an exact differential only
for indefinitely small distances from the axis, the above value of
f is strictly true only for indefinitely small values of r, so that
for the purposes of exact calculation f=l—er”. On the con
trary, the exact values of w and a' are expressed by series con
sisting of an unlimited number of terms, each of which is a
circular function of 2–al t-i-c. These expressions accordingly
prove that w! and a' are propagated along the axis with the
same constant velocity                      ai,
                              and without undergoing alteration.

This reasoning proves that the different    sets of vibrations may
coexist, and that the resulting compound motion is the sum of
the separate motions.    It follows also that there may be an un
limited number of axes of motion having their positions in space
perfectly arbitrary.
   Again, from the approximate general equations already cited,
it is readily shown that                                -         -

To obtain this equation, no other condition is required than
that the motion be small compared to a. It is not necessary.
to suppose either that udz-H way+wdz is an exact differential, or
that a contains no part which is independent of the time.                                                            If,

 is not allowable to take into account this second term, all the
 reasoning subsequent to the determination of the forms of the
 component vibrations having excluded terms of the order of the
 square of the velocity, whether the velocity be component or
 compounded. But it is legitimate to regard Aa<U+017F>i as representing
 the part of the total condensation which corresponds to the sum
 of terms which contain m” as a factor and do not change sign, it
 having been proved that the law of coexistence of vibrations holds
 good notwithstanding that the expressions for the component

    This point being settled, proceed to the determination of the
constants m, and m'. The mathematical reasoning which this
investigation will require is simply additional to that contained
in Part    II.It will be supposed that the waves are incident on
the sphere, regarded   as fixed, in the negative direction of propa
gation, and that they are defined by the equations

At distances r from the centre of the sphere very small com
pared with A, and very large compared with c the sphere's radius,
the disturbance of the incident waves by the presence of the
sphere is conceived to be of insensible magnitude.  In this case
the arc               is always very small within                      the extent of the

thought it worth while to exhibit them. It may, however, be
mentioned, as being confirmatory of the correctness of the mathe
matical processes      I
                     have employed, that the investigation relative
to the term   involving  qr cos qucat, led to results respecting the
mutual action of the sphere and fluid in accordance with those
obtained by the usual treatment of the problem of the resistance
of the air to a ball-pendulum.    But, for reasons which I need
not now repeat, I am of opinion that both these solutions relate
to circumstances of the motion different from those contemplated
in the problem which has been under discussion in this commu
nication.

at the rate of five to six miles an hour, carrying a lighter, which
was previously aground at Mr. James's wharf, entirely up to the
Truro quay, a circumstance of very extraordinary character”*.
On the 17th (three days afterwards) a similar phenomenon was
observed at Liverpool.     All these happened during that week of
terrific storms ending  on Sunday night, the 19th, when the ba
rometer was lower than it had been for three years before. This
week is still more memorable from being in the midst of the
nineteen days of earthquakes which desolated the island of Fayal
in the Azorean group.
   It is a fact worthy of investigation, that when a phenomenon
of this kind occurs at the ports of Mountsbay, a similar occur
                                         I
rence always takes place, as far as have been able to ascertain,
contemporaneously at Plymouth; and probably also in the inter
mediate harbours of Falmouth and Fowey, and this, too, whether
such agitation be noticed elsewhere or not. The days in the
present century on which these disturbances were observed, both
in Mountsbay and in Plymouth, are, 31st May and 8th June,
1811; 5th July and 30th October, 1843; 23rd May, 1847;
25–26th June and 4th October, 1859; and 14th October,
1862,-the agitations, although not accompanied with known
earthquakes, being precisely of the same character as those in
Mountsbay and Plymouth on the days of the great earthquakes
of 1755 and 1761; except that at Newlyn, in the north-west
corner of Mountsbay, in 1755 the sea “came on like a surge or
high-crested wave”f; and that in Lamorna Cove, three miles
south of Newlyn, in the same bay, the sea, as have been        I      in
formed by two descendants of an eye-witness, rushed to the shore
in enormous waves, sweeping along blocks of granite weighing
several tons each, and leaving some of them eight or ten feet
above the level of spring tides.     On the 31st of May, 1811,
above   mentioned,   the agitation  at Plymouth (says Mr. Luke
Howard) “commenced about 3 A.M. and did not terminate till
10. The sea fell instantaneously about four feet, and immedi
ately rose about eight feet.     Universal consternation pervaded
the whole port. The vessels in Catwater were thrown about in
the greatest confusion;     many dragged their anchors, some
drifted, and several lost their bowsprits and yards. About 6.45
the sea rose to the height of eleven feet and again receded”f. In
Mountsbay, on the day of the great earthquake of Lisbon, the
perpendicular rise of the sea at Penzance pier was eight feet, but
at Newlyn pier not less than ten feet.      These tide-like alterna

ting currents occupy generally, in  each efflux, as well as in each
influx, from five to ten minutes.
   Borlase, in his ‘Natural History of Cornwall,” as well as in
the Transactions of the Royal Society, has described similar dis
turbances in Mountsbay during the last century.        And I have
in the ‘Transactions’ of this Society given descriptions of several
in the present century, which are now recorded also in my work
‘On the Land’s-end District,’ published in 1862.
    To explain these phenomena when accompanied by known
earthquakes, Mr. Mallet has written an article in the ‘Quarterly
Journal of Science” for January 1864 (No. I. p. 68), into which
journal was merged that year the “Edinburgh New Philosophical
Journal,’ which contained my numerous papers on the subject,
 read before the Society during the years 1843–60.   The follow
ing is his hypothesis:–
  “Should the origin of the earthquake be                                     under the sea, then
at the point passed through by the seismic vertical, and around                                               it,

    This hypothesis, although advanced                 the most eminent     by
 English writer           on

 improbable.                 (as the passage quoted allows) that
                           Assuming
there is no “submarine      volcano,”  nor any dislocation or frac
ture of the submarine ground, a violent shock proceeding                                                          up
wards vertically from a horizontal portion of the basin of the sea
would pass through the sea as through a solid, without displa
cing any water until it reached the surface, which would be then
dashed up.     If a ship were floating on the spot, that part of the
surface  immediately    under her would transmit the shock to the
ship, and loose articles on her deck would be jerked up to heights
proportioned to the violence of the shock. Thus on board a
ship 40 leagues west of St. Vincent, the men were thrown “a
foot and a half perpendicularly up from the deck’%.
          If
      the submarine ground, instead of being horizontal, were an
inclined plane forming the steep side of a mountain, a shock
proceeding vertically from the interior of the earth would, on
leaving this inclined plane, pass through the sea in a direction
perpendicular to the plane; and when it reached the surface of
the sea, that surface would be dashed up in the same direction.
 Ifthe shock were moving westward, a ship receiving it while
sailing eastward would be stopped as suddenly as if she had
struck on a rock.     Instances of this are also on record.

                   the water, which surface would       then dashed                          be

               the shock were not   repeated,  the water driven sea
ward would instantly flow back towards the shore           regain its                             to

accounts for the first efflux and the first influx of these extraor
dinary oscillations, the succeeding effluxes and influxes being
merely as the continued oscillation or a pendulum when once set
in motion. Thus we see why these agitations generally com
mence with an efflux on our coasts and in our lakes; and why
the waters rise into heaps in the centres of lakes, and then flow
back to their shores.
   Sometimes during these oscillations of the sea subsequent
submarine shocks interfere with the effects of preceding ones,
and retreating currents meeting advancing ones may occasion
those “mountainous breakers” (as Darwin calls them), or those
“great sea-waves” (as Mallet calls them), which occurred at
Newlyn and Lamorna in 1755, as already stated. Nor is it
unusual for a shock on dry land to be succeeded by another after
a short interval; indeed each of the shocks in Cornwall on the
21st of Oetober, 1859, and the 13th of January, 1860, was fol
lowed by a second shock about an hour afterwards—the former
 at Truro, the latter near Liskeard.
     Iam unable to understand how any “long flat swell,” moving
 onwards according to the laws of ordinary waves, and arising,
as   Mr. Mallet           supposes,        in the deep sea, or from a “submarine
volcano’ hundreds, nay, thousands of miles off, but which has
never been observed, could ever have produced such agitations
on our coasts or in our harbours.   How, for example, could it
have produced     such and so frequent disturbances at the piers
of Penzance and St. Michael's Mount, only two miles apart, and
yet none has been observed on the broad and almost horizontal
shore midway between them? Or how could this “long flat
wave” or those successive “ring-shaped waves” propagated from

reason to conclude that on these occasions, as well as on the
day of the great earthquake of 1755, every disturbance of the
sea, wherever it happened, was confined to a few furlongs from
that part of the bed of the sea over or near which the agitated

1755, although observed the same day              most    the European                of
coasts, were perfectly independent         one another, and proceeded

                 at              not. This may appear more clearly
                                            or
by  considering some          the phenomena

near   Reading as the only places where shocks were felt in this
island;  but there is abundant traditional evidence of shocks
having been felt    in Cornwall; whilst in the Scilly Isles “several
persons     ran out of their houses for fear they would fall upon
them.”*.
   On the other hand, if the centre of an earthquake be inland
and close beneath the surface, the shock would not travel verti
cally or upwards at all, but horizontally, as the shock in this
country of the 6th of October, 1863, appears to have done; for
when at Pontypool, in the midst of Welsh mines, soon after                                                            its

felt   at  the mines above ground,            was not felt         any under

                                Mr. Mallet, viz. that the extraordinary

perfect agreement with my hypothesis) may perhaps                      owing                          be

one a sort of verification by aid of trigonometrical formulae in
which the eccentric anomalies are introduced; a second of a
similar nature, but dealing only with the true anomalies; a
third founded on a property of integrals*; and a fourth,
perhaps the most remarkable of any, derived from the general
expressions for the time in an orbit described about two centres
of force varying according to the law of nature, but one of
them supposed to be situated in the orbit itself, and to become
zero.    Notwithstanding this plethora of demonstrations       ven                                     I

ordinary formulae for the time of a planet passing from one
point to another, that, when the period is given, the time is a
function only of the sum of the distances of these points from
the centre of force, and of their distance from one another.

   Since        FP+GP= +2a and FQi:GQ= +2a,
G will be any point in the intersection of either of two circles
Cl, Ca with either of the two Ki, K2, where the squared radii
of C1, C2 are (2a+FP)*, and of Ki, K, (2a+FQ)”, (2a–FQ)”
respectively.   Consequently there are eight real or imaginary
positions of G at a finite, and eight at an infinite distance.
    It is obvious that, if we restrict the orbit to being elliptical,
there can never be more than two admissible solutions; but
treating the question more generally, any even number of solu
tions whatever may exist from 0 to 8, both inclusive.       I am in
debted to my able friend Dr. Hirst for the following figure,

transformation would or would not lead to a new theorem, or
merely, as is possible, to a repetition, with a new set of constants,
of theone already obtained.
    It is hardly necessary to point out how strongly the analogies
established in the preceding investigations point to the exist
ence of some simple dynamical theory of the Cartesian ovals
under the attraction of forces directed to their foci. The inves
 tigation of such theory cannot but tend materially to the eluci
 dation of the essential properties of these most interesting and as
yet little-understood curves, the natural parents of the conic
 sections viewed as focal curves.           -
    In conclusion it may be observed that, in the foregoing paper,
it has been seen how a single orbital force passing through a
fixed centre may be resolved into others of a more simple form.
This suggests a more general subject of investigation, where the
force to be so resolved, instead of passing through a fixed point,
is tangential, or, better, normal to a fixed curve or surface.
    Such an inquiry by no means belongs to ideal mechanics; for
it would correspond to the case of the motion under the earth’s
attraction of a body near the earth's surface, considered as a
surface of fluid equilibrium.

quite completed his thirty-first year.                Previously to entering at
Trinity College, Cambridge, he had attended classes at the Univer
sity of Edinburgh, where he was a favourite pupil of Professor Wal
lace. He passed the examination for the degree of B.A. at Cambridge
in 1837, and was elected Fellow of Trinity College in 1840. In con
sequence of illness he left Cambridge in the spring of 1843, and never
returned. In the brief interval between the first and last of these dates
he was actively employed in promoting the mathematical studies of
the University of Cambridge.             This he did in many ways—partly by
lecturing and examining, but chiefly by his writings.                       He was
mainly instrumental in establishing the Cambridge Mathematical
Journal, and, excepting a short interval, was                 editor from the time     its

hand; and, with an unclouded mind, he prepared himself calmly and
humbly for the great change, receiving and giving comfort and
support from the thankful hope that the close of his suffering life
here was to be the beginning of an endless existence of rest and
happiness in another world.         He retained to the last, when he knew
that his own connexion with earthly things was soon to cease, the
unselfish interest which he had ever felt in the pursuits and hap
piness of those he loved.       A few words may be allowed about a cha
racter where rare and sterling qualities were combined. His upright,
sincere, and honourable nature secured to him general respect.           By
his intimate friends he was admired for the extent and        variety of his
information, always communicated readily but without a thought of
display, for his refinement and delicacy of taste and feeling-for his
conversational powers and playful wit; and he was beloved by them
for his generous, amiable disposition, his active and disinterested
kindness, and steady affection.        And in this manner his high-toned
character acquired a moral influence over his contemporaries and
juniors, in a degree remarkable in one so early removed.”

the natural limits             of
                             the  county.     The   upper  part     the valley          of                   is
excavated       in the carboniferous groups which are continued south

Northumberland, and through the greatest part                  their range form   of
the watershed between the east and west coasts                   England. All      of

the bottom           the valley, while the sides are formed

not daring to come in any house. And it drawing towards night, we
resolved to make an attempt to get to brother John's, and accordingly
set forwards, and got up at our pasture head on to the moor, and
with difficulty got over Harbourgill, and so forwards to the Mun
keybeck.    But we knew that the bridge was broke down, so that we
must be obliged to pass it somewhere on the moor, and we waded
through the water and snow till we were almost spent in extreme
wet and fatigue; and at last got over a little below where our peat
fell is (tho' with very great hazard of our lives), at last, my poor
old Father and Betty being almost quite spent, he having only one
shoe on one foot the greatest part of that time. Then when we were
got over, it gave us some fresh encouragements, and we arrived at
Bro’ Johns just before it was dark, where we were thankful to see
the faces of one another in a place of more safety.   We went three
nights successively to Bro' John's to lodge, not daring to stay about
the old place.     Old Francis Swinbank [rect. Swithinbank] and
Thomas Stockdale's whole family perished in a moment about the
same time that the thing happened with us, being seven in number.
Likewise John Burton, Stone House, had a barn swept away and a
cow   killed.

  Mr. J. W. Clark, Trinity College, read a paper upon the Rib of a
Whale found by some fishermen near Sherringham (four miles N.W.
of Cromer).      It was discovered after a high tide, which caused a
fall of the cliff; it was reported to have been imbedded in drift gravel.
Mr. Clark stated he had compared it with the rib of Physalus, with
which it did not agree; for the tubercle and head of the rib were
very much wider apart in the fossil specimen than in Physalus.         It
resembled Balaenoptera more nearly, and still more closely Balaena
mysticetus.    It was probably the fourth or fifth rib of the left side.
He remarked that a few months since some cervical vertebrae had
been    found at Plymouth which probably belonged to Balaena
Biscayensis, a whale which was nearly extirpated in the sixteenth
century.    It was, however, still occasionally met with, a cow and
cub being not long since seen near Pampeluna, and the latter cap
tured.    He could not positively refer the rib exhibited to any known
species.
   Professor Sedgwick remarked that large cetacean vertebrae had
been found at Landbeach, Cambridgeshire,     and in the Crag of Nor
folk and Suffolk. This was the    largest rib that he had ever seen;
but he had   great doubt,  from         its
                                     general  appearance, whether             it
could have come out     theofgravel.
   Mr. Newton remarked that our knowledge             of
                                                   whales had    late G of

been greatly enlarged; for of the bodies which had been stranded
so many new species and even new forms had been observed, that
hardly two had been found to be identical.
   Professor Miller exhibited two new forms of heliotrope, explaining
at the same time the difficulties in signalling, which they were in
tended to overcome, commenting upon the relative merits of those
invented by Gauss, Steinheil, and others, and explaining the spe
cial advantages of the two which he exhibited.
   Professor Miller also communicated a Supplement to the Crystal
lographic method of Grassmann.
   Mr. G. F. Browne, St. Catherine's College, communicated some
Notes upon some Ice-caves explored during the summer of 1865.
Two of these he had visited during the previous summer, and he
found that there was a somewhat greater quantity of snow in the
caverns than there had formerly been.     In the first cave he again
examined a pit in the ice about 70 feet deep, but, owing to the dan
gerous condition of the ice, was unable to descend into             the                           it.      In
second cave he had again cut through        curtain     ice into an icya               of
tunnel; but this year the diameter     the tunnel was        of
                                                           much smaller                     so
that  he was unable     descend  toalthough   providedit,with ropes for
the purpose.     He described some flies found inside the tunnel. The
third cave had not previously been explored;      was an oval    shape,         it                    in
with a   level floor of ice.   He had descended for about 12 feet
between the ice and the rock, and there found     narrow tunnel which           a
appeared        to
                lead      subglacial reservoir containing water.
                             to   a                                He
ascertained that the ice was     least   feet thick; but

quite pure, and,            on
                      the other, bodies like iodide      potassium       not         of                     do
absorb   ozone, but   merely    part                     of       its
                                              constituent atoms, without
change     of
            volume.     You are familiar with the hypothesis which                                               I
have suggested, which          analogous

hypothesis the density    ozone ought of                            to     be one and  a O,      half times      as
much      as

I     havesucceeded.     I first made some attempts by diffusion, but
hitherto without any great success; but I expect an apparatus which
I have had constructed, and with which I hope to succeed. I then
sought for some substance which should really absorb ozone, but
without decomposing it as iodide of potassium does. I have found
                                                                        of oil

                       It                 suppose   that these oils absorb        to
the ozone entire; hence the possibility          determining the density,                    of

meter, having a steel surface. These two cylinders were connected
end to end by a thin copper wire, the interval bridged over by this
wire being about 4 inch. The other ends of the cylinders were
similarly connected to the polar terminals of a Bunsen cell half
charged (8 water-sulphuric acid; commercial nitric acid; amalga
mated zinc cylinder 6 inches by 3 inches).         These terminals were
made from a rope of four No. 16 copper wires twisted together; each
was about 18 inches long.      After waiting two or three minutes, the
steel-covered cylinder was found to be much hotter than the copper
covered.    This was quite sensible to the fingers; but the most satis
factory way to obtain conviction was to approach the middle part of
 each with the outer dry part of the lips.        It was possible to keep
the  copper-covered  one  pressed  to the  lips for a second or two, but
not so with the steel-covered one. The heat was so considerable in
it that it was not possible to touch it for an instant without sharp
pain. These temperatures were persistent.
   Taking copper as having ºth the resistance of steel, and the rise
of temperature to be in the inverse ratio of the 4th power of the dia
meter of the cylinders or conducting-wires (De la Rive's ‘Electricity,’

corresponded to a blindness for red.   The shortening of the
spectrum increased during the state of narcosis, but it must
be left an open question whether the narcosis or the condition
of the sun was more the cause; for the spectrum had in fact
become somewhat shorter, in consequence of the haze about
the   sun.
    In order to be able to control the length of the spectrum in
each case, it appeared to me better to continue the experiments
with the objective spectrum.       My arrangement consisted in
allowing a solar ray from the mirror of a solar microscope to fall
through a slit into a perfectly dark room, where it first fell on
a lens with a focal length of 3 feet, and then on a flint-glass
prism.    The spectrum was received on a paper screen, or, better,
on a   second, after it had passed through a slit in the first, in
order to cut off the dazzling parts, especially the yellow. While
I displaced the first screen the person experimented upon always
closed his eyes.   The first screen was so placed that the larger
Fraunhofer's lines were distinctly seen. They were used as a
scale, and a place was designated by estimation as #H, when it
was midway between G and H.
   After 5 grains of santonic acid the end of the spectrum in one
case (XXXIII.)* was successively
      at #H instead of H (as it was frequently in other cases),
      subsequently at G instead of #H,
      finally at G instead of H.
    Of course, in artificial colour-blindness,         I always
                                                        compared my
eye  both before and afterwards with that of the person expe
rimented upon.
   Although the spectrum terminated so beautifully, it had the
great defect that, from the fluorescence of the paper beyond the
violet, there was often a foggy colourless zone with Fraunhofer's or
rather Stokes's lines, which often rendered uncertain an accurate
determination of the limit.     Fluorescence explains why to some
during narcosis the violet end did not appear shortened and black,
but whitish (cases XXXIII., XXXV., XXXVI., XXXIX.), since,
even within the violet and blue in the spectrum, fluorescent sub
stances (to which paper and the skin belong) effect a lowering
of the refrangibility. By means of the portion of diminished
refrangibility the violet-blind sees the violet part of the spectrum
like a dull zone, just as a healthy person sees the ultra-violet.
   As, further, in     all
                       these experiments there was only       alteraan
tion  at the blue end,     opposition
                             in          the first experimentt, this
                                              to
defect was peculiarly important.

      It may here       be remarked at once, not only that ultra-violet can
be seen indirectly in the objective spectrum by a lowering of the
refrangibility, but that I know a colleague who even in the sub
 jective spectrum sees the ultra-violet, and, accordingly, actually
'sees it”,     a power of seeing ultra-violet which presupposes a
 heightened sensitiveness of the retina, as in colour-blindness it
 is diminished.    In any case it was seen that the subjective spec
 trum alone could be used for investigating violet-blind persons.
     While thus the results with the objective solar spectrum were
 not up to my expectations, the difficulties in      use were almost           its
 insuperable.       the weather was fine,

allowing them to look in the dark room at the spermaceti light

scribe or, still better, draw what they saw.  The interposition of
a slit was useless.                       -

that their spectrum is not shortened, that the red end takes
up so much less room than the blue, that on this account a
 shortening at the red end might thus perhaps escape notice.
    It can only be said that when there are more than two spaces
 the spectrum is certainly shortened, and not conversely. That
                          I
 this is the case have since then convinced myself.
    It was now the question to be able to ascertain, by means of
 a simple instrument which could be carried in the waistcoat
 pocket, the existence of a shortening of the spectrum—that                                         is,

    1. Colour-blind persons with two intervals in the grating-spec
trum may in fact be blind to red, and indeed blind to potassium
red. Mr. F4 was tried, a Daltonist, who in August 1860 saw
two intervals.
    He saw the red lithium-line (at 13-7), the blue potassium
line (at 2:5 of the photographed scale), but not the red potas
                                                                its

sium-line (at 15); even when            position       the scale was
pointed out,      was impossible for him
                        it                    make     out.                     to
    With the   gas-spectrum     small shortening a was also seen.
     2. Colour-blindness may extend over half the spectrum. On
one occasion Mr. Bt was tried,        Daltonist, who five years ago
                                                            a

                             more saw the red potassium-line than
 did Fit, not even when the place was indicated; the blue very well.
    He saw the chloride-of-strontium spectrum        we did (between                             as
 13  and 14),     any rate when his attention was directed
                        at                                                                                          to   it.

line, and the red chloride-of-strontium      immediately, but the

92                          Dr. E. Rose on the Doctrine
     It follows
              that colour-blindness can occur with regard to both
ends of the  spectrum,   and reduce it to one-half (about ,)—a
result which will convince even one who has only bad instruments
                                                            -
at his disposal.
   Apart from the circumstance that such people are naturally
blind in light of another colour, any colour-blindness is of itself
anablyopia, a weakness of vision which shows itself extermally
in the visage, and for the most part so pronounced that it has
led my friends, healthy in other respects, to visit oculists,       a
result not surprising, as almost (in Mr. M for example) half the
source of light is inactive, from which secondary disturbances
again result.    But that is not the only evil of colour-blindness.
Is it immaterial whether with progressive colour-blindness the
world finally appears in almost homogeneous light? Is it an
advantage to see everything monochromatic : Is the chromatic
aberration of the eye a defect which is common to humanity?
   As    Iwas walking through the streets with Mr. M, whose
power of accommodation and sharp-sightedness are enviable, he
suddenly grasped my arm. The sun had shone out, and without
being led he could go no further. After he had gradually accom
modated himself to the dazzling brightness by closing the eyelid,
he continued the walk with continual spasm of the eyelids and
nystagmus, which he did not before have—like a rabbit which has
the magnesium light reflected on           retina     its
                                                        mirror.   had  by   a                I
previously noticed that his younger brother had nystagmus; and
his mother had assured me that four absent ones had               too.                        it
Hence they had consulted                   all
                                    the most important oculists, and,
as  this was without      success, some less important ones                                       also
not without pain,       that now gave me the most terrible trouble
                                 so         it
to get hold       the brother, who intentionally kept out
                       of                                          the                            of
way.         In
            fact            he
                      also saw five intervals, and was just like his
brother;          so
               that         I         do
                             not hesitate      consider chronic spasm

quence       of
           colour-blindness.          any case  In   must assume that we
man   naturally  sees  nothing   distinctly, because for each homoge
neous constituent        the light

of colour-blindness, quite apart from chromatic delusions, which

    The chaos of contradictions in the older and even in the
newest statements as to defects in the sense of colour, colour
blindness, and Daltonism, is partly explicable by the mode of
investigation, and partly by the circumstance that the two chief
diseases have not been discriminated.
   Both may occur together, as in the highest degree of the san
tonine stimulus, in acute yellow atrophy of the liver, nocturnal
blindness, congenital colour-disease.     All Daltonists are colour
mistaken; from the result of the above-mentioned spectrum
investigation they are probably        colour-blind; hitherto,  all                                        it
                                                                                                           is
true,    has not been shown
         it                       all cases.              in
   As Mr.             M
               (and others)   shows,    congenital colour-blindness
occurs without  colour-mistake,  just     the santonine-stimulation   as
often leaves yellow-sightedness, and does not attain           violet                                a
vision.   Just    among        so
                          five cases                                of

complaints, there was only one, which was quickly fatal,       which                                 in
colour-mistake  supervened,   and that     only  momentarily.    The
other cases went                    no
                          further than colour-blindness (two cases                                              of

     I scarcely  need repeat that      I  have hitherto in vain confronted
 some of these gentlemen—this time, for instance, F, G, ; in no   J
 case has the equation been the same for two patients.
     While a healthy or a colour-blind person seeks in vain for such
 a  colour-equation,   a colour-mistaken person is ready in a minute.
 A completely colour-mistaken person differs from the ordinary
 singly colour-mistaken in the circumstance that the latter finds
 an equality in only one position.            For the former, the upper
 Nicol may be placed as we like; by turning the bottom one
 he effects an equation. Yet the reverse is not the case: the
 lower arm cannot be turned beyond a certain difference of
 brightness.
     Mr. L, for instance”, gave the following equations:–
      1.   O–10       = U–56}        |   19.   O   10+ = U–61

  It is thus   seen that totally colour-mistaken                       people are not so
exact in adjusting as the singly colour-mistaken,_possibly from
a little hastiness if they are tired by the investigation, but
partly from amblyopia and atrophy” of the visual nerve, which
probably always accompanies so high a degree of colour-disease.
This is also seen in the circumstance that the position of the
lower Nicol varies within certain limits.
   These cases can thus, be characterized by a group of equa
tions which indicates the results for both limits, and a mean
value of the lower Nicol; thus, for instance, for

                                               [With Two Plates.]
         preceding paper, I have described the bands produced
IN bythegratings or grooved surfaces with 500 divisions in an
inch when the two grooved surfaces are in contact, and the
grooves in the one slightly inclined to those in the other.
   The following results were obtained with two gratings, one of
which had 2000 and the other 1000 divisions in an inch.
   1. When the surfaces are in perfect contact and the grooves
parallel, the bands seen on the united surfaces, either with a lens
or by ordinary vision, are very irregular and are parallel to the
grooves. They are seen only on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, &c. spectra
on each side of the luminous bar or disk.
   By turning the nearest grating slightly to the right from the
azimuth 0°, the bands fall back to the left, increasing in num
ber, and descending with their concave sides downwards into
distinct serrated black and white bands nearly perpendicular to
the grooves.    When the nearest grating is turned to the left,
the bands descend towards the right, with their concave sides
upwards, till they become nearly perpendicular to the grooves.
In     all
         these positions the bands are twice            numerous        the as                 on

perfectly parallel, the bands are immoveable            the grooved sur      on

100                  Sir David Brewster on the Bands formed by
rous, and more coloured, till they are finally parallel to A M, the
fringes being twice as numerous on the second spectrum as on
the first.
    When the grooves are perpendicular to A M, as in fig. 7, the
bands are faint and indistinct. The light being incident per
pendicularly and the gratings turned round A M on a plane
perpendicular to A M, the fringes do not increase in number or
greatly change, if the motion is accurately in a plane perpendi
cular to A. M.
    When the gratings are turned in the plane of the horizon
passing through A M, the side N M approaching the eye, the
fringes on the left-hand spectra descend, increasing rapidly in
number; and when the side M N recedes from the eye, the
fringes ascend, increasing in magnitude and diminishing in
number, and are highly coloured.    At a certain angle they
become     parallel to the grooves, when by continuing the rota
 tion they move downwards, increasing in number, and again               -
 becoming parallel to the grooves.
    In the preceding experiments the bands are seen on the sur
 face of the gratings; but when the grooved surfaces are in con
 tact and the grooves parallel, bands of an entirely different kind
 are seen, not on the surface of the gratings, but by rays diver
 ging from the luminous disk.                       If
                                            we use a long and narrow bar
 of light, such as the opening between the window-shutters, then,
 when the grooves are parallel to the bar, and the grooved sur
 faces perpendicular to the plane of incidence, the bands are
 parallel to the bar and          spectra. By inclining the grooves

these inclinations the bands                   on

102              Sir David Brewster on the Bands formed by
are best seen when the principal                                circular bands cross the spectra
obliquely.
  In   the preceding experiments with one grating the grooves                                                             of
the reflected image are necessarily parallel to those of the real
grating, owing to the parallelism of the surfaces of the plate
of glass, and therefore they cannot exhibit the result of super
posing two systems of grooves inclined to each other.       This
condition, however, may be obtained by drawing the grooves
on the faces of a prism with a small angle, or by placing a
fluid prism between an ordinary grating and a plate of thin
parallel glass, which would enable us to vary the inclination
of the two sets of grooves. A better arrangement, however,
is to place the grating A B (fig. 11) upon a polished metallic
surface, M. N.   A ray from the luminous bar at R, incident
on A C at r, reaches the eye at E after reflexion from the steel
surface MN, so that the reflected image of the grating A B
is superposed as it were on the direct image.
    When the grating AB, of 1000 grooves in an inch, is laid
upon a steel surface M N, and the grooves are in the plane of
incidence, the paragenic spectra of a luminous bar are covered
                                                                                                                          a all
with bands, not serrated, parallel to the spectra, exhibiting
the phenomena already described             seen     reflexion from      as                  by
single grating.
    The bands are               of
                      the same size      with    single grating when
                                                                   as                 a

the   steel surface commences: the parallel bands open at their
lower  end,  as in fig. 13, or at their upper end, as in fig. 14, and
change into hyperbolas. When the light was strong, I observed
a second but fainter system of hyperbolas lying between the
principal system and the luminous bar, and caused probably by
reflexion from the second surface of the grating. The effect pro
duced by the crossing of the bands arising from these two sys
tems of hyperbolas was remarkable, and similar to what            had                              I
 observed in  combining    two  gratings of 500 divisions in an inch.
 This second system of hyperbolas was most distinct when the
 plane of reflexion from the surface of the steel was coincident
 with the plane of reflexion from the glass; and the double system
 was seen with grooved surfaces of 500, 1000, and 2000 divisions
 in an inch.
    Inusing accidentally a steel surface that was not perfectly flat,
I was surprised to observe that the bands were not hyperbolas,
but circular rings varying in form and size with the angle which
the grooves formed with the plane of reflexion.         In order to
examine this new and beautiful   phenomenon,   I placed the grooved
surface of the grating AB upon a convex surface of steel, MN,
as in fig. 15, so that the rays from the luminous body might
reach the eye at E, after reflexion from the convex surface MN.
The reflected image of the grating is thus superposed upon the
direct image, and two systems of concentric rings are seen upon
the surface of the grating.           At the point of contact, C, and
around        it,
              are seen the   rings     thin plates described

radiant heat cannot be communicated to solid bodies except
through the intervention of a gas; and that the amount so com
municable depends on the density of the gas. This is a very
important conclusion, and needs a fuller statement.         It asserts
that a form of motion is propagated by the sun, travels through
the interplanetary spaces, and strikes on our atmosphere.        That

XIV.         On the Eaplosive Distance of      the direct induced   Current be.

THEgiven
     greatest      striking-distance which can be realized with a
                           machine takes place when the largest
    -
           electrical
possible quantity of electricity is accumulated at the point of the
conductor from which the spark emanates, and when the accu
mulation takes place with sufficient slowness to prevent any of
the fluid escaping before the discharge. As the thickness of the
electric layer is modified by the dimensions and the form of the
body which is brought near, it is evident that the maximum stri
king-distance corresponds to a given discharger. Thus Pfaff used
a ball 8 inches in diameter to draw sparks 18 inches long
from a machine the conductor of which was terminated by a
4-inch ballt. Faraday found that the spark extended furthest
between two balls of unequal size when the smaller ball was
charged positively by induction<U+017F>. M. Riess has shown that these
results are not general, and depend upon the construction of the
machine    employed S.
                    apparatus, when the ends of the induced cir
         In Ruhmkorff's
cuit are so far separated that the interposed air only allows the
direct current generated by the opening of the battery to pass,
facts similar to the above are established.  It is well known, for
instance, that the striking-distance between a point and a plate
is greater when the point is positive than in the opposite case.
But what happens when the electrodes are of the same kind and
                                           I
of exactly similar dimensions : . do not believe that this ques
tion has hitherto been examined.
        To supply the answer,     I used
                                  a bobbin, 0.352 metre in length
and 0.165 metre in diameter. The power of the effects which
it is capable of producing shows the perfect isolation of the
layers of covered wire, which measures about 9000 metres.       It
is a partitioned machine,  furnished with a Foucault’s    amalga
mated platinum break, and was worked with a battery of from 2
to 10 Bunsen's elements, the large size.
   The pairs of similar electrodes between which the spark was to
pass were screwed to the arms of a Henley's universal discharger.
Every possible care was taken that their form and dimensions
of
        **
should be exactly alike.   These electrodes consisted successively

ring 19.18 millims. in diameter, and the truncation 2.82 millims.;
the apotheme, which is 16:35 millims. in length, is terminated
by a cylindrical embase 5:08 millims, in height.

   4. Two gold spheres 18.5 millims. in diameter.
   5. Lastly, two brass spheres 15 millims. in diameter, fixed to
the arms of a second universal discharger, which was sometimes
introduced into the circuit.
   When the Ruhmkorff’s coil is at work, and one of the
electrodes is slowly separated from the other, a distance is
reached at which the spark ceases to pass.         If the current be
then reversed   by means of the  commutator,  the spark either passes
again, or the interval requires to be diminished before this occurs.
Sometimes the difference is not well marked at first, and requires
a certain duration of the electric current before it becomes ma
nifest. When once produced, it remains tolerably constant as
long as the current of the battery retains       intensity.       by
   The apparatus may also         regulated be using the second dis its

   Neither does this influence depend upon difference            the      a                   in
form of the electrodes which terminate the induced wire.        This
may   be  shown          by
                      placing     the circuitin  commutator which   a

  direct induced Current between Electrodes of the same kind. 109
inverts or reestablishes the connexion of each end of the covered
wire with a given electrode. The similarity of these electrodes
is such that no effect is produced.  A more simple method is to
change directly the terminal electrodes without varying their
distance. The success of this experiment requires the employ
ment of similar and well-isolated conductors for connecting the
ends of the covered wire with the arms of the discharger. The
outer circuit should be free from any roughness by which the
charge might be dissipated in the air before traversing the                                    in
terval between the electrodes.
   Thus, in air, between exactly similar electrodes kept at a con
stant distance, the spark passes abundantly or ceases to pass,
according as one of them is or is not positive. The spark
passes when this electrode is connected with the outer positive
end of the induced circuit*. I have verified the fact with a bob
bin of larger size, furnished with an independent Foucault’s
break.     If the direction of the voltaic current is interrupted very
suddenly, a small spark accompanied by a peculiar sound still
passes, but is not usually followed by another.           At the same
time the break changes the course and gives rise to a sound cha
racteristic of the rupture of the induced current.

interposed air and renders the vapour of the water it contains
negative by friction. The path is thus open to the electric cur
rent, the access of which to the negative knob is facilitated by
the expansion of the layer of surrounding air.     Hence Ruhm
korff’s machine differs from the electric battery, in which the
striking-distance does not vary, either according to the circum
stance that one of the armatures is positive or negative, or ac
cording to the nature of the connecting arc”.
    On using as the discharger two wires of the same size and
shape, M. de Moncel had remarked a preponderance of the
positive rheophorus of the induced current, by the interposi
tion upon this rheophorus of a very powerful resistance, as that
of the secondary circuit of a Ruhmkorff's machinet. The various
experiments of which            I
                           have given a summary in this memoir
prove that the form of the ends of the discharger may be very dif
 ferent, and that the addition of a resistance towards one of the
 ends of the induced wire is not requisite to produce a dispa
 rity in the manner in which the discharge traverses a constant
 interval in the free air.

                  Mr.   J.   P. Cooke   on a Spectroscope.                       111
     The general construction       of the instrument           is shown in
fig. 1.
     The two telescopes are constructed in the usual way.                        The
telescope  A, which we shall call the collimator, has an adjust
able slit placed exactly at the focus of the object-glass. The
small tube which carries the slit slides into the body of the tele
scope, but a rack-and-pinion motion would be preferable, so
that when the focus is changed the slit will necessarily remain
vertical.  The rays of light diverging from the slit and rendered
parallel by the object-glass of the collimator next pass through
a series of prisms adjusted around a conical wheel, which will
be soon described, and are then received by the telescope B.
The spectrum, which is formed at the focus of the object-glass
of  this telescope, is examined with eyepieces of different mag
nifying powers in the usual way. The object-glasses of the tele
scopes are 24 inches in diameter, and have a focal length of 15%
inches.    They rest in Y’s, and are provided with spirit levels and
adjusting-screws.     The frames which hold the telescopes are
supported on pivots turning in sockets at the ends of two arms
connected with the body of the instrument, and may be clamped
in any position. The arm which carries the collimator is per
manently attached to the main iron plate, but the arm which
carries   the   observing-telescope      may be moved           around       the
plate.
   The details of the construction are shown in fig. 2, which is
a section made through one of the legs of the tripod and the
moveable arm, the telescope with         its
                                    frame and pivot having first
been removed from the socket.            (This figure,   as   well   as   fig.   4,

 hollow mahogany column with a conical cavity at the top; F is
 an iron cone which rests in the conical cavity, supporting the
 whole body of the instrument, and connected by a long iron
 rod with a clamping-screw beneath the tripod.        By means of
 this arrangement   the instrument   may   be turned as a whole in
 the horizontal plane and the collimator directed to the source
 of light. Above the iron cone, and fastened to it securely, is
 the main circular plate of the instrument, which is 18 inches
 in diameter and an inch in thickness. Near the outer edge
 of this plate is inserted a band of silver, which is graduated
 to 10" of arc. On the under part of the plate there is a neck,
and at the centre of the upper surface a socket, which are accu
rately centred with each other and with the graduated limb.
Around the neck at E moves an iron collar, to which is attached
the arm bearing the observing-telescope. This moves, therefore,
concentric with the graduated limb, and bears a vernier, by which
the angular motion may be determined, reading to 10".             In
the socket of the first   plate rests the  pivot of a second  plate,
C, which turns on the first and supports the prisms with the
adjusting-wheel A. The diameter of the upper plate is an inch
less than that of the lower plate, so as to expose the graduated
arc near the outer edge of the latter; and     its
                                                 upper surfaceis   as
flat and even as  possible.   Rising  from the centre   ofthe upper

plate there is a tall screw pivot of iron, B, on which turns a
conical wheel, made also of iron.    By this motion the wheel
may be either raised or lowered. This wheel is an essential por
tion of the instrument,                     and we will next consider the theory of
its use.
    In the ordinary method of measuring the angle of minimum
deviation  with a Babinet’s goniometer, the prism is placed on a
 revolving plate at the centre of the graduated circle, and so ad
justed that the edge of the refracting angle shall be perpendicu

very thin flexible
brass ribbon, which,
passing through a
box at the back of
each prism, is there
secured by clamp
ing - screws.     The
ends of this  ribbon,
moreover, are at
tached to a small
brass drum, which,
being wound up by
an ordinary clock
spring, draws the
chain   of prisms
tightly around the
conical wheel, and
keeps them always
in place.   By   tra
cing the path of a
ray of homogene
ous light through
a series of similar prisms, as is shown in fig. 4, it will be found
that the path of the ray within the prisms is always a tangent to
the same circle, provided that it passes through              under the    all
conditions  of   least deviation.     Assuming, then, that the dis
tances between the prisms are invariable,          they must

to the extreme violet rays of the solar spectrum.       In order to
facilitate the adjustment, a series of lines were engraved encir

from 1 to 12.
   Having described the construction of the instrument, it will
now be easy to understand the method of using           Let    sup                     it.             us

   When it is not important to use absolutely the whole aper
ture of the prisms, it is not necessary to change the position of
the collimator in passing from one part of the spectrum to an
other.    If we adjust the collimator as above described, when the
prisms rest against the middle circle on the wheel, the whole
spectrum can be passed under review with great rapidity with
out any further change of the collimator, and each point seen
under the condition of minimum deviation.           When, however,
on account of the feebleness of the light, it is important to use
the whole aperture of the prisms, a slight gain can be obtained
by readjusting the collimator at the extreme points of the spec
trum. In making the measurements described in this paper, an
important advantage is gained by keeping the position of the col
limator fixed; for if     position       its
                                      changed, the point       which

rature in the observing-chamber produces at once currents in the
liquid which are fatal to good definition.    Nevertheless, under
the  best conditions, we have found that sulphide-of-carbon
prisms define as well or even better than glass. The instrument

             XVI.        On Regelation.                By       J.    GILL, Esq.k
      ROFESSORTYNDALL’S                ingenious explanation of glacier
        motion, in referring it to fracture and regelation of the ice,
is satisfactorily proved by his experiments of moulding solid ice
into the most varied forms by pressure only, and it seems to be
sanctioned by the opinions of Helmholtz and De la Rive; but
various opinions still prevail as to the immediate cause of regela
tion, or the manner in which the action takes place. Tyndall
imagines that the particles at the surface of a mass of ice, being
free on one side, have greater liberty of motion than the particles
in the interior of the mass, and consequently will melt at a lower
temperature.       He proved by experiment that in ice containing
air and   water-cells,  the ice in the interior of the mass can become
liquid by heat which is conducted through the solid substance
 without dissolving          it,
                           but which melts the ice forming the walls
of  these little chambers where the particles are free           one side,                 on
 and therefore can    liquefy   more  easily.      this respect      In
                                                                 the solid
 particles forming the sides                 of

                                                        condition similar   a
to  thatof   the particles         on

                                                           of      regards                  as

                                     the solid mass      supposed               is                 to   be
 virtually colder than the surface; that           say,    particles have
                                                                 is   to             its
 less liberty  of  motion,    consequently    less motion.    When two
pieces  of  iceat  32° with moistened surfaces are placed          contact                  in
with each other, their touching portions are,           were, transferred  as
                                                                            it

   Still the difficulty remains of the disposal of the heat of
liquidity of the frozen water.    Professor Tyndall is no doubt
right in assuming that the interior portions of a mass of ice
require a higher temperature to liquefy than the surfaces, and
consequently that they may conduct and transmit heat without
melting.    But as this very fact supposes them to be less suscep
tible of individual molecular motion, it is difficult to imagine that
they can absorb or retain heat, unless from a source of appreci
ably higher temperature—that is to say, a temperature above the
margin which distinguishes the capability of liquefaction between
the free and the confined particles, no cause of which is given;
and it is not supposed that the film of water between the ap
pressed surfaces is subject to any other cause of freezing than the
mere sympathetic action tending to induce synchronism of mo
lecular motion, or identity of condition in the neighbouring
particles.
   The explanation given by Professor James Thomson is based
on his interesting discovery of the lowering of the freezing-point
of water by compression, and is briefly as follows:—“The two
pieces of ice, on being pressed together at their points of contact,
will at that place, in virtue of the pressure, be in part liquefied
and reduced in temperature, and the cold evolved in their lique
faction will cause some of the liquid film intervening between
the two masses to freeze.” Of course a sufficient cause of the
pressure should be shown; and moreover it must be supposed
 that the liquid film between the appressed solid surfaces is free
 (or comparatively free) from pressure. With this condition the
 explanation seems satisfactory; and Helmholtz supposes this
 condition to obtain in the case of glacier-motion, as the water of
 the compressed ice can escape through fissures.               This seems
 questionable as a general fact; but, supposing that in general
the water is confined and retained in the internal fissures, the
phenomena might still be explained by supposing the degree of
pressure to be continually varying in any given spot in the mass
from the extensive process of internal fracture and change of
shape always going on in the glacier from                  its

again and throws out the heat                 of liquidity of the frozen particles
into the surrounding ice.
  But in the      of instantaneous regelation in fragments of ice
                  case
merely touching each other, and even when floating in warm
water, there does not seem to be sufficient cause of the pressure
required by J. Thomson’s explanation, even keeping in mind the
fact pointed out by Helmholtz, that the pressure is not equally
distributed over the whole of the two appressed surfaces, but
is concentrated on a few points of contact. Moreover, in the
case of wet surfaces, or when the fragments of ice are floating in
warm water, it is not easy to imagine how any pressure acting
on the pieces of ice should not at the same time act on the films
of water interposed between the surfaces of contact.
    It must therefore be allowed that, in such cases of regelation,
a sufficient cause of pressure is not apparent; yet Helmholtz
insists on the probability of pressure being the proximate cause
of regelation.   He says,               “I
                                find the strength and rapidity of
the union of the   pieces of ice in such complete correspondence
 with the amount of pressure employed, that cannot doubt that            I
 the pressure is actually the sufficient cause of the union.”   On
 this, Tyndall remarks that Faraday’s contact-action would also
 increase under pressure, from the greater extent of surface which
 would be brought into play; and he insists on the difficulty of
 imagining any sufficient cause of pressure in the regelation of
 fragments of ice floating in warm water which freeze together at
their points      of contact. “in        a moment”—convex    surfaces freeze
together—“virtual             points     that touch each other,  clasped                               all
round   by the warm liquid which       rapidly dissolving them
                                                        is                                             as
they approach each other.”      (Phil. Mag., December 1865.)

The proportion of the volumes of an ideal gas is thus like that
of hydrogen.
    Thus, in the case of hydrogen as in the case of an ideal gas, k
must be regarded as independent of the temperature; with hy
drogen, indeed, k changes with the pressure; but this is without
influence in the present case, in which the pressure is constant.
For measuring the temperatures,           suppose               let

The above values of k ought properly to be multiplied by K, which
is constant for each gas. But as we have here only to do with
changes of k,             I
                 have omitted to do so; K, in fact, entirely dis
appears from the proportion.

   Although it follows from Regnault's observations that, in the
case of hydrogen, k does not change with the temperature be
tween 0° and 100°, this is of course only considered to be proved
within the limits of the accuracy of these experiments. It is
not very probable that k is absolutely independent of t, for at no
temperature would hydrogen then approximate to the ideal gas,

Hence between the above-mentioned                  limits of temperature the
formulae   may    be considered to be        sufficiently  accurate.

At 200° somewhat            divergent       results are     obtained, perhaps
because the formula        of hydrogen is too inaccurate at this tem

    The value for carbonic acid was calculated in the same way.

  Regnault found that two thermometers filled respectively with
 air and carbonic acid ran almost parallel to about 300°; and the
 same may be assumed, therefore, between 0° and 100°.      Since,
 now, in the case of air, the values of k were known from what
 has been already said, k could also be calculated for carbonic
 acid at this temperature. The value at —87°C. was not calcu
 lated, as this is near the point of condensation.
    The following values were found for k in the case of carbonic
 acid:—

 In this case also the differences increase regularly with the pres
 sure and with sinking temperature.      The above values of k must

At  100° and smaller pressure the calculation could only be made
for carbonic acid; as in the case of nitrogen, the value of k at
100° is only known for 0.76 metre pressure.

     I believethat from this the conclusion may with certainty be
drawn, that Gay-Lussac’s law of volumes is quite valid; and that,
therefore, from the atomic weights the ratio of the densities for
the limiting condition of the gases may be accurately calculated.
It is true that this in general has not been disputed; but when
a physical principle is to be considered quite accurate, and
therefore applicable as the starting-point of a theory, a new con
firmation is never superfluous.
   It must here be expressly remarked, that the formulae ob
tained give the values of k accurately only within the data taken
for the calculation.             If
                           the above values are calculated for a very
small pressure, for instance 0:2 metre, or for 200°, greater differ
ences are obtained, and sometimes even in opposite directions. For
air, the values of k at 200° and different pressures were found
almost exactly equal to each other; the formulae of the preceding
paragraph give then far greater differences than at 100°. Yet
this does not disagree either with the theory or with the formulae
obtained.     These do not in general give the real law of the
changes in k; the true formula is undoubtedly far more com
plicated.    Yet, within the limits of pressure and temperature
for which they are calculated, the empirical formulae are suffici
ently accurate; that                  is,
                              the deviations which occur are not
 greater than the errors         observation. Within these limits

not for the reason that Regnault's determinations were not suffi
 ciently accurate, but because the calculation of these experiments
leaves much to be desired.     Regnault, as is well known, deduced
his formulae from individual observations, instead of connecting
them by means of the calculus of probabilities with           trust                               all

                               to
Gilpin (1794) are among the most accurate.           With these the

                                                      are far less valu

   The apparatus used by the author was constructed by Geissler
of Bonn, and consisted of a cylindrical vessel of 20–30 millims.
diameter.    Into the upper end a thermometer divided into fifths
and tenths of a degree, and on each side a capillary tube, somewhat
inclined and accurately calibrated, were fused. One of these was
widened at the end in an egg-shape; and both could be closed by
ground glass stoppers. The capacity of the apparatus was about
20–40 cubic centims. When one of the capillary tubes was con
nected by means of a bent tube with a flask containing alcohol,
the apparatus could be filled with alcohol without bringing it into
contact with air, by inhaling at the other capillary tube. The
apparatus thus filled was placed in a water-bath, the temperature
of which did not vary more than +0°.02 in half an hour. When
the thermometer in the alcohol of the apparatus indicated the
same temperature as the water-bath, the position of the liquid
in the capillary tubes was read off by a cathetometer, and the
apparatus weighed. Thermometers, balance, and weights were
all accurately controlled; and          all
                                     observations were thus corrected

error, and determined their magnitude.            His determinations
mostly agree      the fifth decimal

   The author bestowed special attention      the preparation   on                     of
an  absolutely pure alcohol. The spirit was prepared from corn
brandy, and contained 71.6 per cent. alcohol.          Eimer (of        15
12.7 litres) were first distilled over caustic lime and soda, then
over freshly ignited charcoal, and finally repeatedly over fresh
portions      caustic lime, the direct access

   Two other sources of error increase              the specific gravity of
alcohol,    first,  the  extraordinary     tendency      to absorb moisture
from the air (an alcohol of 0.78973 had, after standing half an
hour in an open flask, a specific gravity of 0.78992); and
secondly,       its
                 property      absorbing air

author usually added a little caustic baryta, and by the yellow
colour the dehydration was recognized.        The distillation was
continued with the above   precautions.    The first portions exhi
bited too high a specific gravity; the means were concordant
with each other, while the last portions had again too high a
specific gravity. This latter fact is due to the circumstance that
at a certain temperature absolute alcohol takes water from hydrate
of lime.
   From the numerous and concordant experiments of the author,
the specific gravity of absolute alcohol (water at 4°=1) is
                                       O'78945 at 20°.
The observations which give numbers nearest to this are those of
Muncke, 0.7895; Fownes, 0-78959; and Drinkwater, 0.78958;
while Baumhauer found 0.7899, and Kopp even 0.79277.

   The author's numbers agree best with those                             of   Kopp, although
 the alcohol which Kopp used contained water.                                  This agreement

of water does not materially alter the coefficient of the expansion
of alcohol.
   In the fourth chapter, the author endeavours to determine the
contraction which ensues when alcohol and water are mixed.
For this purpose the specific gravity was taken of accurately
weighed quantities of absolute alcohol and water free from air,
at temperatures of from 0° to 30°.   The different mixtures con
tain 40 to 50  per cent, of absolute alcohol. The observations
were interpolated by means of the method of least squares.
From these it follows that the greatest contraction takes place
with a mixture which contains 45.88 per cent. of absolute alco
hol. Such a mixture can be expressed very accurately by the
formula C*H* 94-3H2O, which requires 46 per cent. This
mixture exhibits the greatest contraction at    temperatures.               all
  The author sees               in   this   a    direct proof that the mixture

    When ordinary phosphorus (that is to say, colourless and trans
 parent phosphorus) is kept in water and is not exposed to a bright
 light, it becomes covered with a white opake crust, seldom very
 thick, which is known as white phosphorus.
     According to Baudrimont, who has subjected this to exami
 nation*, this is neither a hydrate, nor an allotropic condition of
 normal phosphorus, nor does it arise from a devitrification.           It
 is only ordinary phosphorus irregularly corroded on the surface
 and roughened, so to say, by the combustible action of air dis
 solved in water—a slow combustion which diffused light accele
rates, and which ceases as soon as the liquid contains no more
 oxygen dissolved.

A    Treatise   on Attractions, Laplace's Functions, and the Figure of
    the  Earth.     By John H. PRATT, M.A., Archdeacon of Calcutta.
    Third Edition.       Cambridge and London: Macmillan and Co.
    1865.
      S this is the third edition of a well-known work, we need not do
        more than mention generally the nature of its contents, and
then advert more particularly to one or two points in which it differs
from foregoing editions. The first part, which is preliminary to the rest
of the volume, contains in the first place the usual investigation of
the attraction exerted by spheres, spheroids, and ellipsoids on internal
and external points; next, an investigation of the properties of
Laplace's functions, and their application to determining the attrac
tion exerted by bodies nearly spherical on external and internal
points; and lastly, an elaborate and interesting discussion of the
 attractions exerted by tablelands, mountains, &c. This last portion
of the first part is illustrated by a series of examples of cases actu
ally occurring in geodetic operations, particularly those of the Indian
survey.     It may be remarked that the attempt to take account of the
effects of local attractions is the distinguishing feature of the book.
    The second, and by far the larger part of the book is devoted to
the question of the figure of the earth.      This is discussed from two
points of view, first, theoretically, on the hypothesis of the earth's
being, or having once been, a fluid mass; secondly, practically, as
determinable by geodetic operations.         Each of these discussions is
very elaborate; and in the course of them there are passed in review
a number of detached observations and investigations            scattered
through various scientific journals. Those who are interested in
learning what has been done on this subject since the publication of
Mr. Airy's celebrated Treatise, will obtain the requisite information
from the present work, which is brief, clear, full, and worthy of
Archdeacon Pratt's high reputation as a mathematician.

   We will now proceed to offer some observations on each of these
discussions, and will begin with the second of them.     It is scarcely
necessary to mention that the mean surface of the earth is nearly or
exactly that of an oblate spheroid, whose minor axis coincides with
that of the earth's revolution; that         equatorial radius cannot    its
differ much from   20,925,000    feet; and that its ellipticity,     the                                               or
ratio which the excess     the equatorial radius over the polar radius

lunar inequalities, and the precessional phenomena . . . . make it
highly probable that the earth has once been in a fluid or semifluid
state” (Conclusion to Treatise on the Figure of the Earth).           And
Archdeacon Pratt (p. 160) says, “we can hardly conceive stronger
evidence than the foregoing pages furnish that the earth was once a
fluid mass.”
     As the Archdeacon has brought forward an additional argument
on the subject, and one of great importance if sound, we will
briefly pass the whole in review, as stated in the present work.
     In the first place, the variations of the force of gravity on the
earth's surface deduced from this hypothesis exactly coincide with
those which are ascertained by means of experiments with pendu
lums. In the next place, the moon's motion in latitude experiences
a perturbation which falls in exactly with the hypothesis.          In the
third place, by making a particular assumption as to the variation of
 the densities of the consecutive strata, a value of the ellipticity of the
mean surface is deduced which nearly coincides with that ascertained
 by geodesy.      In the fourth place, on the same assumption, an ex
 pression for the annual precession can be deduced which, when
 compared with that which actually exists, gives an ellipticity for the
 mean surface not differing much from that ascertained by geodesy.
     Such being the evidence, let us now consider its value. It is
 plainly all of one kind. An hypothesis is framed, and is found to
 lead to results coinciding with observed facts. This may be presump
 tive evidence of the truth of the hypothesis, but is not proof. If a
 large number of phenomena of various kinds are connected and ex
 plained by an hypothesis, the presumption is strong, and may amount
 to something equivalent to proof.      But if the facts are few, the pre
sumption cannot be strong; and if to enable it to embrace these few
 facts it has to be backed by a subsidiary hypothesis, the presumption
 in its favour is very much weakened.       And this seems to be the case
 with the fluid hypothesis.     The third and fourth “tests” depend on
 a particular assumption as to the variation of the densities of the
  successive layers, viz. that expressed by the formula
                               pa-Q   sin qa,
 where p denotes the density of the layer whose semi-major axis is a,
  Q and q being constants.     Now this formula does incidentally imply
  that the  density increases as the centre is approached, and is so far
 unobjectionable; but its chief recommendation is that it possesses
 the unique property of rendering a certain differential equation inte
  grable.   It would, to our mind, be a singularly happy coincidence
  if a law of density assumed for such a purpose were physically
  true.   We think, therefore, that the real evidence for the fluid
  hypothesis is reduced to that furnished by the first two “tests.”
     Now, with regard to them, it is plain that any hypothetical
  arrangement of the matter composing the earth would possess the
  same amount of consistency with these facts as the fluid hypothesis,
   provided that the matter when so arranged continues to exert the
   same attraction as before on all external points.    Hence in order to

 complete the proof of the fluid hypothesis, it is necessary to show
 that no such arrangement is possible.          And this Archdeacon Pratt
 attempts to do.      He says (p. 80), “Suppose some change were made
 in the arrangement of the earth's mass without altering                external                             its
 form.      It  evident that, although the resultant attraction
                  is                                                          the                                      of

 before     every point
            at                the surface;” and then follows some general

 reasoning too long         quote.    Not content with this,                                                he

  To check, therefore, the method, I was led to determine the coef
ficient of expansion of mercury, and, basing my calculations on Kopp's
coefficients of expansion of water, I expected to obtain Regnault's coef
ficient of expansion of mercury.    The coefficient deduced from expe
riments did not agree with Regnault's; and being unable to discover
any source of error in the method of experimenting, I determined to
reinvestigate the matter.
    The memoir is divided into four parts.
    I. On the determination of the coefficients of the linear expansion
of certain glass rods.
    These rods (1825 millims. long and of 20 millims. diameter) were
kindly made for these experiments by Mr. F. Osler. The method
used for the determination of their increment in length was that of
measuring it with a micrometer-screw, with which a length could be
measured with accuracy to 0-001 millim.
    The rod was placed in a long trough, the one end of the rod
resting against a fixed glass tube capped with zinc, the other against
another glass tube the other end of which rested against the micro
meter-screw.     Water was allowed to flow through these glass tubes
during the time of observation.       The trough being filled with water
at ordinary temperature and the position of the screw read off, the
water was heated to boiling and another reading taken.
    The mean of sixteen observations gave for the linear expansion of
these rods
                           Lº–Lo   (1   +0.00000729t),
and therefore for the cubical expansion

  II. On the method employed for the determination of the cubical
expansion of water and mercury.
  This part of the paper contains a full description of the apparatus
employed, and the precautions taken.
  The method consists of weighing the substances in water at                  dif
ferent temperatures, and from the loss of weight in water deducing
its volume.   For this deduction, the expansion      water    of
                                                             differ.    at

  It will be seen from the foregoing Table that Kopp's values are
lower than the others; and bearing in mind that the coefficient of
expansion of mercury, when deduced by means of these, falls below
that obtained by Regnault, but when deduced from Despretz's or
my own agrees closely with Regnault's, we are led to conclude that
Kopp's values must be somewhat incorrect.

   The faces which have been observed are all in one zone, and
exhibit a symmetry which is compatible with either the prismatic
or the oblique system. The crystals probably belong to the pris
matic system.        They are aggregated in such a manner as to render
it very  difficult to isolate a single crystal, or to determine the faces
which   belong    to the different individuals of a group of crystals.

   1.  “On     the impressions    of Selenite in the Woolwich Beds and
London Clay.” By P. Martin Duncan, M.B., Sec. G.S.
   Spaces formerly occupied by crystals of Selenite having been
described by the author as occurring in Woolwich Beds near
Mottingham, Kent, and in the unfossiliferous London Clay of Ten
dring Hundred, he endeavoured to account for the phenomena to
which he had drawn attention.            The various facts bearing on the

sited, their chemical composition, and the mineral condition of the
fossils, having been described in detail, Dr. Duncan proceeded to
discuss the explanations that could be suggested to account for the
formation and subsequent disappearance of the crystals.    He came
to the conclusion that the mineral had resulted from the action of
sulphuric acid, contained in percolating water, on preexisting car
bonate of lime, the sulphuric acid having been formed by the oxida
tion of sulphuretted hydrogen by the oxygen evolved from the de
composing vegetable remains occurring in the Plant-beds interca

resulting from the same decomposition would in solution be suffi

Dr. Duncan urged that, if his explanations were accepted, the oc
currence of Selenite in a deposit must be held to prove the former
existence of organisms in     and the removal    it,

        Mr. E. Tawney      on the Rhaetic Beds in South Wales.      157
December     6, 1865.-W.     J. Hamilton, Esq., President, in the Chair.
   The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Western Limit of the Rhaetic Beds in South Wales,
and on the position of the Sutton Stone.” By E. B. Tawney, Esq.,
F.G.S. With a Note on the Corals of the Sutton Stone, by P.
Martin Duncan, M.B., Sec. G.S.
    Mr. Tawney commenced with a description of the Rhaetic beds
as they occur near Pyle station, west of Bridgend, and at Cwst y
Coleman, north-west of that place, giving detailed sections of the
beds at these localities, and showing the distribution of the fossils
in them. The author then described the characters of the “Sutton
Stone,” and showed its relations to the beds above and below, giving
to the building-stones generally called “Sutton Stone” the name
“Sutton Series,” and to the beds which intervene between the Sutton
Stone and the base of the true Lias, and which have hitherto been con
sidered Lias, the name “Southerndown Series,” illustrating the stra
tigraphical features by a general section from Sutton to Dunraven
 Castle, and by vertical sections at Southerndown and Laleston.
From the evidence yielded by the fossils, the author was of opinion
 that the Southerndown series belonged to the Rhaetic formation,
 and must be separated from the Lias—that the Sutton series is some
 what older than the Avicula-contorta beds, and has affinities with the
 Trias—and that, by the discovery of Ammonites in the Sutton beds,
 the first appearance of that genus in the British area has been
 proved to have occurred during a period anterior to the Lias.
     In his note on the Corals, Dr. Duncan stated that, besides two
 species derived from the Carboniferous Limestone, he had been able
 to determine four species of Zoantharia from the base of the “Sutton
  Stone.” These Corals are unlike any hitherto discovered in North
  western Europe, and, with certain reservations, were said to indi
  cate an horizon which, in the Alpine Triassic districts, would be
  deemed St. Cassian ; but, as our knowledge of the vertical range
  of the St. Cassian Corals is at present very imperfect, their absolute
  age cannot be more definitely stated, their occurrence in South
  Wales rendering it probable that they have a greater vertical, as
 they are now proved to have a greater horizontal, range than has
  hitherto been supposed.
     2. “ Notes    on a Section   of Lower Lias and Rhaetic Beds near
  Wells, Somerset.”       By the Rev. P. B. Brodie, M.A., F.G.S.
     A section   recently  exposed at Milton Lane, one mile and a half
 north of Wells, exhibited the Lima-beds passing into and overlying
  the White Lias and Avicula-contorta zone.         The author described
  the section (which was constructed by Mr.       J. Parker and himself)
 in detail, and showed that the Lima-series attained here a thickness
  of 10 feet 4 inches, and the Rhaetic beds, including the grey marls,
  of 18 feet 6 inches; he was not able to discover any trace of Am
  monites planorbis, or of any of the peculiar limestones indicating the
  “Insect” and “Saurian” zones. He found one fragment from a

158          .                    Geological Society:—
bone-bed lying loose at the end of the lane, and containing character
istic fish-remains; but though he searched carefully, he could not find
in situ the bed from which it had been detached.
   December 20,            1865.-Sir Charles Lyell, Bart., in                            the Chair.
   The following communication                    was   read:—
   “On    the Conditions of                the Deposition       of Coal, more especially
as illustrated by the Coal-formation                         of Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick.”           By    J.   W. Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In several former papers Dr. Dawson has endeavoured to illustrate
the arrangement of the Carboniferous rocks of Nova Scotia, and to
direct attention to their organic remains, the structures found in the
coal, and the evidence which they afford as to the mode of accumu
lation of that mineral.     In this paper the author summed up and
completed his researches, adding some new facts resulting from the
study of the microscopic structure of more than seventy beds of coal
occurring in the South Joggins section, and of the fossil plants
associated with them.
    Some general considerations relating to the physical conditions of
 the Carboniferous period in Nova Scotia were first given, the author
 dividing the strata representing that period into (1) the Upper Coal
formation, (2) the Middle Coal formation, (3) the “Millstone-grit.”
 formation, (4) the Lower Carboniferous marine formation, and (5)
the Lower Carboniferous Coal-measures, describing the characters of
these divisions in detail, and giving a sketch of the physical con
ditions which prevailed during their deposition.          He was of opinion
that we must     regard   each of the above-mentioned divisions as the
evidence of a period presenting during                           its
                                                    whole continuance the

                                              this, Dr. Dawson contended
                                                       in
that the occurrence          Stigmaria

proves beyond question that the material             the coal was accumu
lated   bygrowth      situ, while the character
                       in                             the intervening strata
proves the abundant transport                  of

    On the Microscopic Structure       of the Eozoon-Serpentine.   150
January 10, 1866.-W.      J.   Hamilton, Esq., President, in the Chair.
    The following communications were read:—
    1. “On the Origin and Microscopic Structure of the so-called
Eozoon-Serpentine.”       By Prof. W. King and Dr. T. H. Rowney.
    Taking the Grenville Rock as its type, “Eozoonal Serpentine”
was defined by the authors to consist essentially of variously formed
granules of Chrysotile, or some other allied mineral, imbedded in,
or intermixed with, Calcite. Although differing from the type in
some respects, the varieties of Serpentine which they have examined
from Connemara, Donegal, the Isle of Skye, India, Bavaria, and the
State of Delaware are considered to belong to the same section.
The Serpentine from Cornwall, the Isle of Anglesea, and Saxony,
which appears to be devoid of “Eozoonal” structure, they were dis
posed to look upon, but with considerable doubt, as an eruptive
rock. The authors stated their conviction that every one of the
presumed organic structures of “Eozoonal” Serpentine is purely
and primarily mineral or crystalline. The “skeleton” they held to
be identical with the calcareous matrix of certain minerals, notably
Chondrodite, Pargasite, &c. They adduced various considerations
and evidence to show that the “proper wall” cannot have resulted
from pseudopodial tubulation; and, instead of being an independent
structure, in their opinion it is no more than the surface-portion of
 the granules of Chrysotile crystallized into an asbestiform layer.
The dendritic and other forms, considered to represent the “canal
 system,” were shown to be tufts of Metaxite, or some other allied
variety of Chrysotile; while the resemblance they bear to some
 which are common in crystalline limestones, also their identity to
 the imbedded crystallizations of native silver, moss agates, &c.,
 and the total dissimilarity between them and the foraminiferal struc
 tures with which they have been homologued, are points which the
 authors held to be conclusively fatal to the view which contends for
 such forms being of organic origin; in their opinion they are no
 more than imbedded “imitative” crystallizations. What have been
 taken for “Stolons,” they were convinced are for the most part
 crystals of Pyrosclerite. The “chamber-casts” were considered to
 be identically represented among both minerals and rocks,—in the
 former by the grains of Chondrodite, Pyrallolite, Pargasite, &c.;
 and in the latter by the segmented kernels of native copper, Zeo
 lites, &c., in eruptive rocks; also by the remarkable botryoidal and
 other shapes which occur in the Permian limestone of Durham. The
 authors concluded by offering it as their opinion that “Eozoonal”
 Serpentine is a metamorphic rock; and they threw out the sugges
 tion that it may in many cases have also undergone a pseudo
 morphic change; that    is, itmay have been converted from    a   gneis
  soid calcareous Diorite by  chemical introductions  or eliminations.
   2.   “Supplemental Notes       on
                                  the Structure and Affinitiesof  Eozoon
  Canadense.”    By W.  B.  Carpenter, M.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In   this paper Dr. Carpenter stated that recent siliceous cast
                                               a                      of
  Amphistegina from the Australian coast exhibited      a perfect repre
  sentationof  the “asbestiform layer" which the author described     in

 160                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 his former communication on the structure of Eozoon, and which led
 him to infer the Nummuline affinities of that ancient Foraminifer—
 a determination which has since been confirmed by Dr. Dawson.
This “asbestiform layer” was then shown to exhibit in Eozoon a
 series of remarkable variations, which can be closely paralleled by
those which exist in the course of the tubuli in the shells of existing
Nummuline Foraminifera, and to be associated with a structure
exactly similar to the lacunar spaces intervening between the out
side of the proper walls of the chambers and the intermediate
skeleton by which they become overgrown, formerly inferred by the
author to exist in Calcarina.
   Dr. Carpenter then combated the opinion advanced by Professor
King and Dr. Rowney in the preceding paper, and stated that, even
if the remarkable dendritic passages hollowed out in the calcareous
layers, and the arrangements of the minerals in the Eozoic lime
stone, could be accounted for by inorganic agencies, there still             re
mains the Nummuline structure of the chamber-walls, to which, the
author asserts, no parallel can be shown in any undoubted mineral
product.
   In conclusion the author stated that he had recently detected
Eozoon in a specimen of Ophicalcite from Cesha Lipa in Bohemia, in
a specimen of gneiss from near Moldau, and in a specimen of ser
pentinous limestone sent to Sir Charles Lyell by Dr. Gümbel of
Bavaria.

 ON    THE MEASUREMENT OF SMALL FORCES BY MEANS OF THE
            PENDULUM,  BY MM. JAMIN AND BRIOT.
       a spherical ball, suspended by a flexible wire attached to a
WHEN
  fixed point, is removed but a little from the vertical, and has im
 parted to it a very small initial velocity in any direction, its centre de
 scribes approximately an ellipse situated on a horizontal plane. When
the amplitude of the oscillations is sufficiently small, the two axes of
the ellipse may be regarded as constant in magnitude and in direction.
 If there is no initial velocity, the small axis of the ellipse is equal to
zero, and the motion is in a plane.
    But if on the pendulum in motion a force is made to act other
than that of gravity, and relatively very small, this force produces
in the elliptical motion of the pendulum modifications or perturba
tions which we propose to study.
    We first treated the question analytically by aid of the method
of the variation of constants devised by Lagrange. The constants or
elements in this case are four; that       is,

   As in the Mécanique Céleste, the perturbations are of two kinds,-
the one periodic and producing no appreciable effect; and the other
the so-called secular, and which, accumulating themselves, end, in
virtue of their action repeated during a sufficiently long period, in
producing an appreciable effect, however feeble the disturbing force.
These latter it is important to calculate.  In order to limit the ques
tion, we supposed that the perturbing force emanated from a fixed
point A situated in the horizontal plane at a distance h from the
centre O of the ellipse, and varied inversely as the square of the
distance, which would be the case if there were an attractive or re
pulsive spherical mass fixed in this point. We supposed, moreover,
that the initial value of the minor axis was null—that is, that the
oscillation of the pendulum was originally plane.    Under these con

     and       are small quantities of the second order (the perturbing

 force being taken as a small quantity of the first order), and therefore
 may be neglected.    Hence the direction of the major axis and                                          its
 magnitude are virtually invariable.     But the two other elements

   The variation of the element r produces a change in the duration
of the oscillation; but this small change did not seem to us capable
of being determined with certainty by experiment, as the least change
of temperature in a very long pendulum produces a much greater
change in the duration of the oscillation. The only appreciable
effect is the variation of the small axis.

the force diminishes, the effect decreases; but as it is proportional
to the time, it is only necessary to wait till it becomes appreciable
and capable of being measured.
   These very special conditions appear to us of a nature to justify
the use of the pendulum for measuring attractive or repulsive forces,
however small they may be, and for comparing them to a common unit,
gravity.    Those forces which are accessible to this mode of investi
gation are, in the first place, all the physical forces, and then especi
ally that of universal attraction, which might show itself, not by a
static effect of given magnitude, but by an action which is always
accumulating so as to produce a considerable perturbation.            Ex
periment has shown that                         all

            ON THE EXPANSION OF SATURATED WAPOURS.
                        BY M. A. CAZIN.
   Messrs. Rankine and Clausius deduced,               1850, from the equa
                                                                       in

                                                                        on

adjacent bodies neither furnish nor withdraw from                 any heat.        it
    M. Hirn observed this about 1862. He verified, moreover, two
other consequences        the same equations; that
                                 of                           that bisulphideis,                             of
carbon under ordinary circumstances behaves like water, and that
ether behaves differently, becoming superheated                 expansion, and    by
condensing partially by compression.
    M. Dupré has finally deduced from the equations                   the theory
                                                                                             is of

 Hirn for their valuable advice.
    The first researches were simply qualitative; before determining
                                                                                a its

 and immersed in an oil-bath.            After being heated to a given tempe
 rature, it is exhausted and the liquid gradually introduced.                  The
 moment of saturation is ascertained            by  a  slight deposit    of dew on
 the glass plates.        Connexion is then established with a cold reser
 voir containing air at a known pressure, lower than that of the
 vapour; and at the same time the condition of the cylinder is ob
 served.
    Water and ether behaved as in the experiments of M. Hirn; the
 vapour of the latter liquid never condensed by expansion, while that
 of the former always did. When the difference of pressure was
 more than 0.5 metre of mercury, the fog formed rendered the interior
 of the cylinder completely opake; when it was less, a halo was often
 seen round a flame looked at through the vapour.
    With chloroform, the inversion takes place when the pressure of
 the reservoir is increased. Beyond a certain pressure no condensation
 is obtained, even when the excess of the pressure of vapour is mate
 rially increased. An idea of the experiments may be formed from the
 following Table, in which the pressures are approximately measured
 by columns of mercury.

    It is thus seen that vapour saturated at 125° and expanding with
an excess of pressure of 1:13 metre does not condense, but that
vapour at 129° condenses with an excess of 2:52 metres.                       It is
readily understood that this latter, attaining during expansion the
temperature of inversion at the moment at which it has a pressure
equal to the maximum tension which corresponds to this tempera
ture, behaves from this moment like a vapour which starts from a
temperature lower than that of inversion; thus in this case the fog
is only visible at the end of the expansion.—Comptes Rendus, Janu

of these   I described  the ores of manganese and their uses; and         I
select for the first subject in the present series of papers these
ores, more particularly with reference to their chemical composi
tion and mineralogical characters.
    Manganite.—This species occurs abundantly at Cheverie, on
the south shore of the Basin of Minas, in Hants Co., where it is
found in modules, sometimes of considerable size, on the beach,
about twenty rods above high-water mark, and on the upland
nearly two miles from the water.          It is also met with at Walton,
 some miles to the east of Cheverie on the Petite River, where            I
have picked it up in the fields, and where a bed of it is said to
crop out in a low hill on the river-side.           It is mostly of compact
crystalline structure, of a dark-grey colour, gives a brown streak
and powder, and has hardness a little above 5. In the compact
pieces small cavities are sometimes found, lined with black lus
trous prismatic crystals affording a brown streak; these most
probably consist of the essential elements of the species.              The
mineral is associated with        barytes  and     calcite,   and sometimes
with pyrolusite.     The geological formation of the surrounding
district is lower carboniferous; the prevailing rocks are gypsum
and limestone, sometimes containing magnesia, the latter being
that in which     I believe the ores of manganese always occur in
this  part  of Nova Scotia.
    A specimen from Cheverie was analyzed: the water and
oxygen were determined by ignition in connexion with a tube
filled with chloride of calcium ; the amount of binoxide of man
gamese was ascertained by the oxalic-acid process, and the corre
sponding quantity of sesquioxide calculated; the siliceous gangue
containing a small amount of barytes was estimated by action
with hydrochloric acid as a solvent for the soluble constituents,
among which were a little iron and baryta, which were not
weighed.      The results were these:—

    The amount of oxygen lost on ignition was 3:57 per cent., and
the theoretical loss, in the change of the Mn” O° found into
Mn” O*, is 3.01. These numbers leave no doubt that the mineral
is the hydrated sesquioaide of manganese or manganite, the theo
retical composition of which is—

for it is obvious that, if allowance were made for the unessential
ingredients, there would be very close accordance.   Another spe
cimen of hard ore   resembling   the former, and probably from the
same locality, gave a chocolate powder, and afforded
  Binoxide of manganese, 45.4 = 82.4 per cent. sesquioxide,
with barytes and a little carbonate of lime, results which prove it
to be also manganite.
   This species forms a curious bed of conglomerate, along with
quartz pebbles, about ten miles to the west of Walton on the op
posite shore of the estuary of the Avon, formerly considered
to belong to the New Red Sandstone.
    Pyrolusite.—This species is found at numerous localities in
different parts of the province, and is now being mined in consi
derable quantity at one of them, viz. at Teny Cape, in Hants Co.,
about five miles from Walton, where about a thousand tons have
been got out within the last two years, the bulk of which has
been readily sold in England.          It occurs here in the form of
nodules of irregular, generally rather flattened shape, of              sizes,                all

The steps by which this reasoning may be justified may be                                               pre
sented as follows:—
    A blindfolded man is told that four points are marked on
a  large sheet, and is asked the chance that one of them is en
closed by the other three.      He requests that the points may be
joined by four lines, no three passing through a point.            There
are now six  points;   and if he is allowed now to  inspect  the  figure,
there are three original groups of four points from which it is
equally probable that the figure originated, and in one only, and
one always, of these three groups one point is enclosed by the
other three ; so that the probability is #.
    The reasoning may also be justified in the way by which the
result of the first question was arrived                            at.
    This method, which might           called instantaneous,

30°      or
         35°) before    reaching   the  equator,  the difference       level                           of

a     channel, however narrow, with the unfrozen ocean about the
equator, now and          the time                      of
                                       greatest glaciation

                                            650 and 1000 feet. The at
thickness of the ice                    in
                             these latitudes would be 3500 and 5250
feet; that             is,

   Now,       the ice-sheet began

176                      Prof. Chapman on some Minerals
tions, the force of attraction would not change till the water
from the melted ice had had time to flow away towards the open
sea in the equatorial latitudes; for the water derived from the
ice, though fallen down a few hundred feet into the channels
and lakes below in the general mass, would attract very much as
the ice itself did. And as the gradient of 1000 feet in 60° of
latitude is very slight, the tendency of the water to flow out and
of the sea-level to sink as the ice was turned into water would
be feeble, and the outflow much obstructed by the windings of
the channels and the countercurrents produced by impact upon
the enormous ice-fields into which the ice-sheet would at first be
broken.
    It appears to me, then, extremely likely that the supply of
water in the northern latitudes from the melting of masses be
tween 3000 and 7000 feet high would be far more rapid than
the outflow of water owing to the solid mass becoming less;
and the consequence would be that during the Drift Period the
ocean in the northern    latitudes would stand at a much higher
level, for a considerable time, than 650 and 1000 feet in lati
tudes 45° and 60°; and vast icebergs with huge boulders fixed
in their lower parts might find ample depth of water to carry
them over         all
               the places where the phenomena       abrasion and              of
drift-deposit have been found.                        H. PRATT.                   J.

trace of galena, or any other substance, except a small quantity
of specular iron ore; and the unaltered appearance of the latter
is such as to preclude the supposition of the metal having been
derived from galena, or other lead compound, by artificial heat.
The lead, when cut, presents the ordinary colour, softness, and
ductility of the pure metal. Before the blowpipe it melts
readily, and volatilizes, imparting a blue tint to the flame-border,
and forming a yellow ring of oxide on the charcoal. The fused
globule is perfectly malleable. On the cupel it becomes entirely
oxidized and absorbed without leaving a trace of silver. The
cupel stain, when cold, is of a clear yellow colour, showing the
absence of copper, nickel, &c. The nitric-acid solution yields
with reagents the ordinary reactions of lead-oxide. The sub

crystals that have come under my observation in these lodes.                                            I
have assayed a good many samples for silver without finding any
workable quantity of the latter metal. The highest amount that
I  have obtained corresponds, indeed, to no more than 1% oz. to
the ton of reduced lead. This comparative absence of silver
appears to be connected with the very general absence of arse
mical minerals throughout the district.    A comparative study of
the classical lead-districts of both Europe and this continent will,
I think, be found to warrant the conclusion that, where arsenical
ores, such as arsenical pyrites, Fahl-ores, &c., are generally
absent, the galena will not prove to be argentiferous in a paying
point of view.

miles east of the Kaministiquia river.           In                      all

Bay, near Black River (lat. 48° 46' N., long. 87° 17' W.).
Some specimens from one of these veins gave me (by mecha
nical analysis) very nearly 4% per cent. of molybdenite, an amount
equivalent to about 100 lbs. per ton. Copper pyrites is also
present in the quartz.
    5. Barytine, BaO, SO*—It has long been known that many
veins of heavy spar or barytine occur on the north shore of Lake
Superior, several of these veins being almost free from colouring
matter, and hence of good quality as a paint-material; but am  I
not aware that any crystals from this region have hitherto been
described.    From the vein in Neebing township (about ten or
twelve miles from Fort William), in which the cockscomb variety
                                                 I
of marcasite (described in § 3) was obtained, procured a great
number of small crystals of this mineral of a pale yellowish or
reddish colour.     The same forms are present in all, producing
a combination of (1) the base, Go & ; (2) a front polar or macro
dome, 3 co; (3) a second or lower front polar, $ 35; and (4) the
side polar or brachydome 36, the crystals being elongated in a
right-and-left direction, i. e. in that of the macrodiagonal or
longer horizontal axis. Most of the crystals, apart from this
elongation, offer a very symmetrical aspect; but in some, as
often happens, certain planes become crowded out, or reduced
to mere lines, a plane of the form # 00 being generally the suf
ferer.   In the present case the angles measure as follows:—
 30 & (base):# 35 =158°; 35 36:# 35 = 141°4; 30 36:05–127°15'.
Axes: a (vertical axis) = 1.315; a = 1; ii-0-814]. It should
be observed, in reference to the crystallization of barytine, that
 some crystallographers make the base, as here given, a side ver
tical (or brachypinakoid of Naumann) = 20 & .          In this posi
 tion the front polars, 4 & and # 36, become vertical prisms; but
 the side polar or brachydome, &, remains unchanged.
    6. Fluor-spar, CaF.—Examples of this mineral are met with
 in many of the copper-ore and other veins of Lake Superior;
 but some unusually fine specimens have been lately obtained
 from large vugs in a broad vein of amethyst quartz, situated a few
 miles inland from the north-east corner of Thunder Bay. These
 specimens are crystallized in simple cubes, most of which mea
 sure from 2 to 3 inches across; and they occur as a bold capping
 on equally large pyramids of amethyst. The fluor-spar is thus
 the later formation of the two, and it is itself coated with a
 still newer formation of drusy pyrites in small cubes. Its colour
 is partly pale greenish, but mostly violet, like that of the chief
 mass of the quartz on which it lies. These fine crystals may be
 obtained in blocks of the dimensions of several cubic feet, form
 ing magnificent museum specimens. . Many of the amethyst
 crystals exhibit externally, or along their edges, a deep brownish

oxide of iron deposited within or just beneath the surface-layer.
   7. Anthracite.—In the Revised Report (1863) issued by the
Geological Survey of Canada, a small amount of anthracitic
matter is said to occur in cracks in the chert-beds of the lower
division of the upper copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior
(altered strata of Lower Silurian age), as seen in the vicinity of
Thunder Bay. A small vein of this kind, nearly vertical in posi
tion and averaging about 5 or 6 inches in width, occurs on the
north shore of the bay. It was discovered by Mr. Herrick, a
surveyor well known in Canada by his extended explorations in
this remote district.  A thin layer of colourless quartz lines the
walls on each side.        This is followed by about half an inch, or
rather more, of iron pyrites, possessing a radiated structure, but
crystallizing on         its
                          inner surface        combinations  in      the cube          of
and octahedron. To this succeeds another band                     white crys        of
tallized quartz; and the middle              the vein    of

and highly lustrous anthracite.            The vein thus offers, though
of   small size,    a fine example          banded  of   riband structure,

pressure, we have, in the first place, for 4° and 100° the formulae
given in the second paragraph ; the analogous formula may also
be calculated from the values of k at —87° given in §     III.   From
the three values corresponding to the pressures 0-76, 1, and 2
metres, we get the formula
            k=[0.99749–A(h–1)+B(h–1)*]K,
            A=0.0046608,         log A=7-66846–10,
            B=0.00017608,        log B-6:24570–10,
from which   ;  may be deduced for —87°.
   Comparing this formula with the two corresponding to the
temperatures 4° and 100°, it appears that the values of A and
B, and therefore the variation from Mariotte and Gay-Lussac's
law, are much greater at this lower temperature.
                               -
   c1–c may now easily be calculated for the pressures 0-76, 1,
and 2 metres, and between the temperatures —87° and 100°.

Gauss's addition and subtraction Tables were always used, as
given in Wittstein’s Tables of Logarithms.
   The following Table was obtained for c,   -cin   the case of air:-

   Hence the value of c1–c decreases with increasing tempera
ture and diminishing pressure. Taking for the limiting value
of k, according to the Table in § III., k= 1.00067, which in any
case is not far from the truth, though it cannot be quite defi
nitely calculated, we have
                       J-

           c1–c-                   422-10
which gives the limit to which ci-c approximates.
   If this limiting value be calculated for hydrogen, it must, if
reduced to the same volume, give the same number—as follows,
indeed, from the well-known formula           ci-c-    },  which is   appli
cable to an ideal gas, and hence also to this limiting condition.
Forci-cis proportional tok; and the same applies to the volumes,
since for the same weight, temperature, and pressure these vary
with k. A direct testing was not possible, since the volumes
determined by Regnault had to be reduced to the same limiting
condition; and for this condition k, as was observed, could only
be determined approximately.
                              Carbonic Acid.
   In the   case   of carbonic acid this value could be calculated for
3° and 100°. We have, for instance, at 3° and 0.76 metre
pressure,

   The following Table was thus obtained for          cº-c in    the case of
carbonic   acid:—

condition from Gay-Lussac’s law of volumes. The value of k
for hydrogen in the limiting condition is very nearly = 422-23.

The quantity of heat in a kilogramme of air at 4° and 0.76       -
metre pressure is less than that which it contains
           at 5° and under the pressure 0”7626 by c,
and
           at 5°       3.2       25        0m-76  by c--000005.
Hence in the latter case more beat is contained in the air than
in the former.
   If  a kilogramme of air at 5°, and under a pressure of 0.7626
metre, were allowed to expand until the pressure was 0.76 metre
without performing any external work, as, for instance, if it were
placed in connexion with an exhausted space, 0.00005 thermal
unit would have to be added in order to keep the temperature
at 5°. If this quantity is not added, the temperature sinks. In
this way the following results are obtained:—

   Thomson and Joule have, as we know, determined the depres
sion of temperature which takes place when a current of gas is
pressed through a narrow aperture, and have thus obtained the
results given in the last column. The fourth column gives the
depression of temperature which takes place at the temperature
given in the sixth column, when the difference of pressure is an
atmosphere.     Comparing these numbers with those in the third
column, we see that they are tolerably proportional one to an
other, especially if we take into account the differences in tem
perature; in the case of carbonic acid Thomson’s number refers
to 91°, the preceding to 100°. This agreement in results obtained
in such entirely different ways may be regarded as a confirmation
of the theory.
   The numbers in the third and fourth columns cannot be
directly compared, since they refer to unlike differences of pres
sure. The fifth column gives the cooling in Thomson and Joule's
experiments for a difference in pressure of a metre.   Comparing
this and the third   column, it is found that the  cooling in the
direct experiments was always greater except in the case of hy
drogen; but the absolute value in numbers is in this case too
small to consider this an exception and not an error of obser
vation.

case of    air
           and carbonic acid.   The cooling observed       Thom                by

formed    the passage from the initial
          in                                the final condition;

 heat is indeed again produced, but which, as Clausius shows%,
 partly passes into the sides of the vessel. In our calculation for

   The following remarks may be made in conclusion.          In defi
ning an ideal gas, in § I. only has it been assumed that k is con
stant. This is enough where it is only a question of deviations
from Mariotte and Gay-Lussac’s law; and the deduction of the
absolute zero depends on no further assumption.           But where
the  specific heat is concerned, it must be defined more accurately
whether the    gas in  expanding  is to perform internal work or not.
The assumption that in this gas no internal work is performed
is at the basis of the definition of Carnot's function of tempera
ture. Upon this depends the further development of the theory,
and      its

a small deviation is of very small importance, but of much greater
in the case of solids and liquids.    It is therefore of urgent ne
cessity to investigate as accurately as possible whether such an
ideal state occurs in the case of gases—not because the condition
of these gases is of such importance in itself, but because the
entire theory of heat, so far as it is connected with the ordi
nary definition of Carnot's function of temperature, stands or
falls with it.                                                     -
   The occurrence of this ideal condition is the more probable,
the more the various deviations of actual gases from the ideal
condition taken together converge towards nil. As regards
Mariotte and Gay-Lussac’s law, this follows from Regnault’s
investigation, and it is confirmed by the testing of the law of
volumes; the values of the internal work given in § VII. show,
too, that this decreases with higher temperature and lower pres
sure; this also follows from Thomson and Joule's experiments,
which in this respect have great value.      So          previous         far   as
observations permit,      believe
                            I      may conclude, from what has
                                            I
here been communicated, that these deviations decrease together,
by  which the validity    the assumption
                                of             ideal gas acquires

  By       Captain         A. R. CLARKE, Royal Engineers,                                     F.R.S., F.R.A.S.*
      IN  the application of the method of least squares to the deter
          mination of the figure of the earth, there is this anomaly,
  that the semiaxes are not determined by making the sum of the
  squares of the errors of observation or measurement a minimum.
  Of the existing uncertainty as to the figure of the earth, but a
  small portion is due to errors of measurement or observation; it
  is mainly due to the circumstance that the earth is irregular,
  and cannot be precisely represented by any ellipsoid or other
  simple (algebraically speaking) surface.              Imagine a spheroid
  having         its
               axis coincident with that          the earth’s rotation, and    of

   All this seems  exceedingly   simple; but Archdeacon Pratt, in
the third edition of his ‘Treatise on Attractions, Laplace's Func
tions, and the Figure of the Earth,’ of which a notice appeared
in the last Number of the Philosophical Magazine, has obscured
it by attaching some special importance to certain points (one in
each arc) which he calls standard stations, a term unknown to
geodesists.    For instance, St. Agnes is considered the standard
station of the English arc; but on what grounds? because it is the
southernmost station ? If so, Saxaford has an equally good claim
to be considered the standard station because it is the northern
most; and Greenwich Observatory might have a special claim.
But in reality the standard station is that with reference to which
the differences of latitude in each arc have been taken. The selec
tion of the point in any arc with reference to which differences
of latitude are to be taken is merely a matter of arithmetical
convenience—nothing more: the southern extremity (in the
northern hemisphere) presents facilities; so does the northern;
but it is really quite immaterial, since the result, as is easily
shown, is quite independent of this consideration. Any station,
then, in an arc may be selected as the standard station in this
SenSe.

XXIX.        On the Eapansion of Saturated Vapours.  By W.                                J.

         To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
          GENTLEMEN,
IN forthethe 2nd            of the French Academy of Sciences
               Comptes Rendus
                  of January,   1866, there appears a very inter
esting and important communication by M. A. Cazin, in which
the author states the results of experiments which he has made
for the purpose of testing one of the conclusions deduced from
the laws of thermodynamics—viz., that when a vapour in the
state of dry saturation performs work by expansion in a non
conducting cylinder, there is a certain critical temperature for
each vapour such that below that temperature the expansion is ac
companied by partial liquefaction, and above it by superheating.
   M. Cazin mentions Professor Clausius and myself as having
simultaneously predicted in 1850 the liquefaction of vapours
under such circumstances; and M. G. A. Hirn as having shown,
in 1862, that for certain vapours at certain temperatures, and
in particular for ether, expansive working is accompanied by
superheating.   He then refers to M. Dupré as having proved,
in 1864, that for each vapour there is a temperature below which
expansive working causes liquefaction, and above it superheat
ing, as above described.
   Without detracting from the claim on the part of M. Dupré
to having arrived at that result by an independent investigation,
I wish to point out that the fact of there being such a critical
temperature for each fluid is clearly indicated in my paper “On
the Mechanical Action of Heat,” published in the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh for 1850 (pages 170, 171),
and that an approximate formula for that temperature, with                                its
probable value for steam,    given      me         by

heat of the vapour at constant pressure, and         the dynamical                 J
equivalent of a unit of heat, t being the absolute temperature,
as before.   In a paper read to the Royal Society of Edinburgh
in  1855,  but not published, the same formula was shown to ex
press in dynamical units the total heat of gasefication of any sub
stance under any constant pressure when the final absolute tem
perature is t. In the present paper the author equates that
expression to another expression for the total heat of evaporation
from the absolute zero, at a given absolute temperature t, as

or 8 x 07034. If we suppose such a mass as two miles thickness
of ice, or say 10,000 feet of the density of water, this would give
an elevation over the mean level of some 700 feet.      But it is to
be borne in mind that, to obtain such a mass, we must rob the ex
isting sea of the greater part of                   it.

                                  may feel very confident that the
elevation over the mean level for two miles of ice will not exceed
80  feet, which      reallyis  considerable depression from the

after which the terms become so small and so nearly balanced
as not to be worth setting down.       The result for fifty terms is
A x 01127, or near upon as much again as the quantity obtained
for northern elevation.
    The general result, then, of the disturbance of the earth’s sur
face is not such as was anticipated by those who first started this
speculation, though it cannot surprise those who are familiar
with the theory of the tides. The solid nucleus of our ideal
earth remaining central, as we have seen, there is an accumula
tion of water towards the two opposite regions where the differ
ence between the extraneous attraction on the surface and on the
centre, which is the true disturbing force, is greatest.       In the
tidal theory, owing to the great distance of the luminary, these
differences follow the same law, sensibly, under and opposite
to the disturbing body; but in our case the changes are very
rapid under and near the ice, which lies close to the surface,
while they are gradual in the opposite hemisphere.              Hence
results an egg-shaped form of sea surface, with a comparatively
sharp little end at the north, balanced by a big-end or broad
spread mass at the south, both ends combining to rob the equa
torial region.

    As said at the beginning of this paper, the failure to account
for the special facts of the glacial epoch does not deprive this
theory of a certain positive value. If it cannot explain elevations
or depressions of 1000 feet, it does teach us there is an agency
 at work in nature, which had perhaps been overlooked, which
 must be borne in mind in         all

 between two parallel planes tangental to opposite ends of a dia
 meter, and if the friction on one plane were greater than that
 on the other, the sphere would acquire a rotation in the direc
 tion it would have       if rolling   on the plane whose friction is
 greatest.
    13. The actual orbital motion of the earth being elliptical
 (nearly circular), the part of the surface of the earth (for super
ficial resistance) whose resistance to the medium would tend to
cause rotation in the same direction as the orbital motion of the
earth, and the part whose resistance would tend to cause rota
tion in the opposite axial rotatory direction, are the two parts
cut off by an elliptical (nearly circular) cylinder, one of whose
focal axes passes through the sun, and whose plane radius vec
tor reaches from the centre of the sun to the centre of the earth.
For penetrative resistance, mutatis mutandis.
    14. This principle may be easily illustrated experimentally in
the following manner:—A heavy spherical ball is hung by a fibre
of silk in a wide shallow cylindrical vessel of water. The water
is made to gyrate slowly and steadily by the rotation in it of a
little cardboard screw worked on the end of a stick by a thread
wound round its axis.   As soon as the water is in motion the
ball begins   to rotate on a vertical axis in the same direction.
The orbital   motion of the earth is here represented by the gyra
tion of the  water in the cylinder.
   15. The   actual axial rotation of the earth is in the same di
rection as its orbital rotation. Hence, if its axial rotation be due
to the resistance of the aether, the resistance on the part of the
earth nearest the sun must be greater than that on the remoter
side.           -
    16. This cannot be the case if the aether offers uniform resist
ance throughout, but it would result from the aether which lies
nearer the sun being denser than the remoter aether.
   17. Such a difference would result from the possession by the
aether of weight and elasticity.
   18. The idea of compressibility and elasticity is inseparable from
that of aether; or rather the necessity for an aether has been
felt in order to explain the phenomena of light and heat by
means of travelling states of unequal compression and the re
covery from such states—called undulation.    Further, there can
be no such thing as density, either constant or variable, and           {
therefore no such thing as undulation without matter.     Nor is
it possible to conceive matter without weight.
   19. Hence it is no extension of the ordinary conception of
the aethereal medium to suppose that the aethereal medium ex
tends throughout    all space, indeed, but      is
                                               more dense     in

  20. The hypothesis here proposed is therefore briefly this.
The solar system is full of aether which has weight. It is massed
most abundantly round the bodies of that system which have
the most mass: chiefly round the sun. Spreading from the sun
in    all   directions,          it   diminishes           in   density.          In      its   passage round
the sun the earth encounters the resistance             this ather.                            of

                       the earth nearest                                of to

met with           by
              the remoter side. Consequently the earth revolves
on its axis in the same direction    its orbital rotation.      as

XXXIII.        On an improved form of Statement of the New Rule for
     the  Separation   of the Roots of an Algebraical Equation, with a
    Postscript containing a New Theorem.           By Professor SYLVEs
    TER, F.R.S.*
        Y   new rule (of which the demonstration will be found in a
            paper by the late lamented Mr. Purkiss in the last Num
ber of the ‘Cambridge, Oxford, and Dublin Mathematical Mes
senger”) for separating the roots of an algebraical equation,             I
mean the rule which bears to Newton’s rule generalized the same
relation as Fourier's to Descartes's, is susceptible of a certain slight
improvement as regards the mode of statement, which appears to
me deserving of notice.
    If we suppose fr=0 to be the equation in the theorem as
                       I
originally stated, have employed the double progression
                         fr, fºr, fºr, ... fº,
                          Ga,    Gia,  Gar,  ... Gar,
where fºr means        (#)'<U+017F>, and G,     a  means (fa)*-yºf-12.f4:12,
y, being a known function of r involving an arbitrary parameter,
confined between limits of which one is dependent on n.
    In applying the theorem, it becomes necessary to count the
number of compound successions for which, on writing a given
value a for w, f...f41 and G, . Grit, are both simultaneously
positive, and also the number of the same for which f...f.41,
and Gr. G,41 are simultaneouly negative and positive respec
                           -
tively, the succession

                               Gr   Grº
what    I  have called a double permanence, and in the other case
a variation-permanence.           This latter is of course to be distin
guished from a permanence-variation, which corresponds to the
supposition     off,  f.i. bearing like, and Gr, Grº, unlike signs—
there being in fact four kinds of succession, viz. double per
manences,       variation-permanences, permanence-variations, and
double variations.
    If  the enunciation of the theorem can be made to refer to
double variations and double permanences exclusively, it is evi
dent that something will have been gained in point of simplicity
of statementit; and this     -
                                  can easily be effected in the manner
following.

supposed, an absolute maximum, and subsequently that even
where it agreed with the method commonly employed, it was
essentially faulty.   By admitting the principle of discontinuity
(the legitimacy of which will presently come under considera
tion), and by reasoning in other respects according to the
received rules of the Calculus of Variations, a solid of revolution
was obtained such that the generating line of       surface    com                   its                   is

220            Prof. Challis on the Solution of a Problem in the
essentially the same, and the investigation by polar coordinates
is here adverted to only because it first suggested to me the idea
that the introduction of the factor has an important bearing on
the solution of the problem.      Since the differential equation
from which the subsequent inferences are drawn is incomplete
without the factor, and as the factor equated to zero satisfies
the complete equation, this solution must certainly be taken as
an answer, in part, to the proposed question. The integral of
r   cos   64-r' sin 6=0, or           %–0.           is   r   sin 6=const., or     y= const. ;
and, so far as this integration indicates, the required surface is
cylindrical.
   We have next to inquire what inferences may be drawn from
the integral of the complete equation.     The conditions of the
problem being expressed by

    Supposing the integral to be taken from one extremity of the
 straight line to the other, y18y1 and yoëyo are each indetermi
 nate, and the equation is satisfied because p =0 and po-0.                                                  If
 taken between either of the given points and the extremity of
 the corresponding circular arc, and if yo and y be the respective
 ordinates at these limits, the second term of the above equation
vanishes because yoºyo–0; but since yicyi is indeterminate, the
other term can vanish only because pi-0. We may hence infer
that the straight line and the arcs are continuous at the points of
junction, and that each arc is a quadrant of a circle. The gene
rating line of the required surface of revolution is thus com
pletely defined.
    The result to which the foregoing investigation has conducted

cylinder and two hemispherical ends of the same radius, is larger
than any other solid of revolution having the same amount of sur
face and the same length of aris.

226        Prof. Challis on the Solution of a Problem in the
nates are continuous with the curve, and that the curve is a                        semi
circle, the radius of which is c. Hence, h" and c being given,
the length of the ordinates and the content of the solid may be
calculated.
   The method of solution adopted in the August Number of
1861, gave for the connecting line in the last example a portion
of the curve described by the focus of an hyperbola rolling on a
straight line. The foregoing argument has shown that the                             fal
lacy of this determination consists in making use of an integral
obtained by means of a factor, and not subsequently taking into
account what was indicated by the factor.                -
   Although it results from this new method that the curve just
mentioned has no application in the solution of the problem that
has been under discussion, I think it worth while to point out
that the length and area of that curve are erroneously calculated
in the August Number, and to obtain the correct values, as the
process will serve to illustrate a part of the reasoning in the pre
sent communication.       The semiaxes of the hyperbola being a
and b, the differential equation of the curve is
which remains the same whether y be positive or negative.     But
for the present purpose it will suffice to consider only the posi
tive values of y.     By supposing that pºst-0, and substituting
a’e”—a” for         bº,
                   we obtain a(e–1) for the positive minimum
value of   y,and a<U+017F>e--1) for the positive maximum value.     Also

          colours of a soap-bubble, proverbial for their beauty,
        have long furnished an apt illustration of the optical
effects produced by thin films; but the fragility of the subject

always in rapid motion. Many other appearances were observed;
among the most common are spots of such regularity that at
first sight they produce the effect of structure.    Under a high
power, these latter are resolved into series of Newton's rings of
excessive minuteness.     The variety of the phenomena is quite
remarkable; but the most commonly occurring effects are those
in which the colours red and green prevail. The motion ap
pears to be invariable.    It is diminished, though not prevented,
by first passing the light through a layer of water and covering
the bubble by a small glass shade.
   A flat film will also produce similar effects to a bubble when
viewed through the microscope, but the latter was found to
answer somewhat better.
   The determination of the thickness of the film in which such
effects are produced is a matter of some interest.         Optical
methods are practically inapplicable, since various thicknesses
will produce the same colour, provided they fulfil the condition
of being         constantly either even or odd multiples of
                                                                                                 } It       was,

lowing method, and the results are probably approximately correct.
It consists in determining the weight of the bubble in the fol
lowing manner:—A mixture of hydrogen and            was prepared                       air
which,         by
           filling bubble, would cause

atmosphere without showing any considerable tendency        ascend                                    to
or descend. The bubble was carefully freed from           adhering                               an
drop, and was measured        making                 by
                                          (while still attached      it                                          to

  1866.     DR. Air-cells, and the       Mechanism of Respiration, in
Birds.”
    After brief mention of the additions made to our knowledge of
these matters by numerous distinguished physiologists, he remarked
that still more remained to be done—a proof of the difficulty of the
subject. Several of the commonly received views are quite untenable,
 --such as that the air-cells are intended to assist in supporting the
bird in flight, by rendering it lighter, in consequence of the rarefac
faction of the air in the air-cells, and the hollow bones; and again,

that the air-cells are a sort of second respiratory apparatus, so that
birds may be described, as they were by Cuvier, as animals having
a double respiration. In disproof of these views, it was shown that
a pigeon weighing 10 ounces, or 4375 grains, would have           weight                                   its

the blood-vessels are very minute and sparsely scattered.         Hence

middle     the seventeenth century had correctly described the air
                of

the openings,                on

error that the air passes from the air-sacs into the cavities          the pe                             of

out of the air-cells and bronchial tubes of various orders is difficult
to describe, especially without diagrams.
   The respiration of birds, even when in repose, has been shown to
be much more active than that of mammals.          But in order that
birds may be equal to the enormous exertion required of them for
sustaining themselves in the                   air

be very large, and powerful muscles must have been provided for the
respiratory movements.      But this would add unduly       the weight                     to                    of
the body.     The lungs therefore are small, very porous, and light;

In  short, more perfect localized instruments   respiration cannot be        of

   The appearance of this comet in the telescope was that of an oval
nebulous mass surrounding a very minute and not very bright nu
cleus.     The length of the slit of the spectrum-apparatus was greater
than the diameter of the telescopic image of the comet.
   The appearance presented in the instrument when the centre of
the comet was brought nearly upon the middle of the slit, was that
of a broad continuous spectrum fading away gradually at both edges.
These fainter parts of the spectrum corresponded to the more diffused
marginal portions of the comet.          Nearly in the middle of this broad
and faint spectrum, and in a position in the spectrum about midway
between b and F of the solar spectrum, a bright point was seen.
The absence of breadth of this bright point in a direction at right
angles to that of the dispersion showed that this monochromatic
light was emitted from an object possessing no sensible magnitude in
                                                                               -
the telescope.
    This observation gives to us the information that the light of the
coma of this comet is different from that of the minute nucleus.
The nucleus is self-luminous, and the matter of which it consists
is in the state of ignited gas. As we cannot suppose the coma to
consist of incandescent solid matter, the continuous spectrum of its
light probably indicates that it shines by reflected solar light.
    Since the spectrum of the light of the coma is unlike that which
characterizes the light emitted by the nucleus, it is evident that the
nucleus is not the source of the light by which the coma is rendered
visible to us. It does not seem probable that matter in the state of
extreme tenuity and diffusion in which we know the material of the
comae and tails of comets to be, could retain the degree of heat me
cessary for the incandescence of solid or liquid matter within them.
We must conclude, therefore, that the coma of this comet reflects light
received from without; and the only available foreign source of light
is the sun”. If a very bright comet were to visit our system, it might
be possible to observe whether the spectra of the coma and the tail
contain the dark lines which distinguish solar light.          If  the conti
nuous spectrum of the coma of Comet 1, 1866, be interpreted to
indicate that it shines by reflecting solar light, then the prism gives
no information of the state of the matter which forms the coma,
whether it be solid, liquid, or gaseous. Terrestrial phenomena would
suggest that the parts of a comet which are bright by reflecting the
sun's light, are probably in the condition of fog or cloud.
    We know, from observation, that the comae and tails of comets are
formed from the matter contained in the nucleus.
    The usual order of the phenomena which attend the formation of
a tail appears to be that, as the comet approaches the sun, material
is thrown off, at intervals, from the nucleus in the direction towards
   * This conclusion is in accordance with the results of observations on the
polarization of the light of the tails of some comets. Some of these observa
tions appear to have been made with the necessary care.      See J.  P. Bond's
“Account of the Great Comet of 1858,” Annals of the Astronomical Obser
vatory of Harvard College, vol. iii. pp. 305–310.

 the sun. This material is not at once driven into the tail, but usually
 forms in front of the nucleus a dense luminous cloud, into which for
 a time the bright matter of the nucleus continues to stream.        In this
way a succession of envelopes may be formed, the material of which
afterwards is dissipated in a direction opposite to the sun, and forms
 the tail. Between these envelopes dark spaces are usually seen.
     If
      the matter of the nucleus is capable of forming by condensation
a cloud-like mass, there must be an intermediate state in which the
matter ceases to be self-luminous, but yet retains          gaseous state,          its
and reflects but little light.     Such     non-luminous and transparent

wards Antwerp, but within the Polder-belt, were conjectured, from
their composition and on other considerations, to have been derived
from sands carried inland away from dunes of the Boulder-forma
tion period. The Lös, which is of freshwater origin, resulted from
the annual depositions of melted snow-waters.     The dispersion of
the Cailloux Ardennais was referable to another and earlier stage of
a period of cold, and when the axis of the country had a greater
relative elevation than at present. These views were supported by
reference to the coast-section at Sangatte.
   The Boulder formation proper is only slightly represented                        in
some of the sections about Antwerp.
   With respect to the Lower Kainozoic series, the author preferred
the divisions proposed by M. Dumont (Scaldésien and Diestien) to
the minute subdivisions of Sir C. Lyell and M. Nyst.  The exceed
ingly narrow vertical dimensions of the Crag, and the manner in
which, along the continuous sections now exposed, one bed of the
Scaldésien Crag replaces another, are new facts, and preclude any
systematic order of sequence, founded on percentage comparisons,
from local assemblages of fossils.
   The Antwerp Crag series presents two conditions of sea-bed:—a
deepish-water and life-zone formation, corresponding to the ooze
depths of existing seas; this is the Diestien of Dumont, or Lower
Crag : on an eroded surface of this, there occurs at Antwerp an upper
series of coarser sands, shingle, and gravel, together with much
which has been derived from the lower; this is the Scaldésien.
The change from one to the other indicates a change as to depth
over the Crag sea, and the result has been an admixture                         of the
characteristic materials of distinct sea-zones.
   The original boundary line of the Crag sea is traced, as also the
great breadth of the drift-sand zone, over the Belgian area; this—
coupled with the consideration that the Crag-sea waters on the
continental coast-line nowhere came in contact with any beds older
than Nummulitic, such as Tongrien and Bruxellien, even as high as
Denmark, whilst on the English side, from Suffolk north,      coast       its

 ON   THE CHANGES WHICH STRETCHING AND THE PASSAGE OF A
     VOLTAIC CURRENT PRODUCE IN A MAGNETIC BAR.                      B.Y. M.
     VILLARI OF NAPLES.
       ATTEUCCI      states that if a bar of hard iron which is magnetized
        by a spiral is stretched, the magnetism of the bar increases. If
the stretching ceases, the magnetism again diminishes.          If the same
experiment is made with soft iron, the reverse is the case. If the mag
netizing spiral is not at work, stretching also causes an increase of
magnetism, and relaxation (nachlassen) a diminution.
    Wertheim has repeated Matteucci's experiments, but only con
firms his results in case the magnetizing spiral is at work. He adds
at the same time that the deflection. of the galvanometer observed
is smaller each time the stretching is repeated and the more the
wire is straightened.       He doubts, therefore, whether with a per
fectly straight wire, stretching alters the magnetism of the wire.
    As no further statements exist respecting stretching, it appeared
desirable to make a few new experiments on the subject, in order to
explain the difference between Matteucci's and Wertheim's experi
ments. The apparatus consisted, like Matteucci's, of two spirals,
a magnetizing and an inducing one, in the latter of which a Wie
demann's mirror galvanometer, with sliding coils, was inserted.
    In this method it is not the existing magnetism of the iron or steel
 bar which is measured, but the inducing-action which a change in it
produces.     But the subesquent investigation only refers to changes:
and these    may  very well be measured by the induction which they
produce.
    The apparatus employed was the following:—
    One spiral was firmly fixed in the other, and they were well fas
tened in a frame which stood on a table, and in such a manner that
their common axis was from east to west. The galvanometer was
 at a distance of 4 to 5 metres from the spirals.       The bar of steel or
 of iron which was to be used for experiment, was inside the inner
 spiral. At each end of the bar a thick brass wire was soldered, or
 else screwed.    In order that neither these wires nor the bar to which
 they were fixed should move laterally, they passed through two
pieces of wood which were firmly united with the frame in which
 were the spirals; and they also passed through corks which stuck
in the ends of the inner spiral. One end was fastened to the stand
by means of a screw, at the other was a rope which passed over
a pulley, and by means of a lever could be stretched by 240
pounds.
    The steel and iron bars, before being placed in the apparatus, were
moreover straightened as much as possible, and after they were            in
 serted were repeatedly drawn and, in order that they might be
straight, were stretched by 40 pounds.

240        .             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   Both the spirals were coiled on brass sheaths slit lengthwise. The
external magnetizing spiral, which consisted of covered copper wire
2.4 millims. in diameter, was 580 millims. in length by 225
millims. external and l 10 millims. internal diameter.    The interior
spiral consisted of covered copper wire l millim. in thickness and
600 millims. in length; this had an external diameter of 30 millims.,
and an internal one of 19 millims.
  The bars of iron and steel were all several inches shorter than the
 inner spiral.
    The results of this investigation may be summed up as follows:—
    With a closed magnetizing spiral, stretching and relaxing, the
 stretching produces an increase of the magnetic momentum up to a
 certain point; in like manner, opening and closing a voltaic current
 sent through iron or steel bars produces an increase of its mag
 netic momentum up to a certain amount.
    If this limit has been attained, in further stretchings (as well as in
openings and closing of the current which is passed through) the
 magnetism oscillates about this limit; in a steel or iron bar, stretch
ings diminish the magnetism, if it is thin and strongly magnetized,
while relaxation of the stretching produces just as great an increase.
 But if the bar is thick and powerfully magnetized, an increase is
produced on stretching, and on relaxation a diminution.
    Yet, in transmitting a current, there is a difference between steel
and iron when this limit has been attained.              In the case of iron,
there is an increase on      closing the   current, and on opening just as
great a diminution, whatever be the direction of the current.           Steel
exhibits the same behaviour if the current enters at the south pole
of the magnet; but if it enters at the north pole, there is conversely
a diminution on closing, an increase on opening.
    In the case of an open magnetizing spiral, stretching and relaxa
tion produce a diminution of magnetism, to a certain amount.                 In
like manner the passage of a current and                      its
                                                     interruption produce                   a

opening        closing the current, the magnetism oscillates about this
               or
limit; and        soft iron stretching produces

through the bar. The same              the case with steel
                                               is                 the positive

   An accident to one of the large turbine-wheels employed by the
Merrimack Manufacturing Corporation of Lowell has furnished a
most remarkable illustration of the modern mechanical theory of
heat; and through the kindness of Mr. Isaac Hinckley, the accom
plished agent of the Corporation, I have the pleasure of bringing the
facts to the notice of the Academy.          I cannot do better than to
begin by reading Mr. Hinckley's own statement in a letter addressed
to me, dated December 30th, 1864. The specimens referred to in
the letter             I
               have placed on the table for the inspection of the
Academy.
    “In accordance with your request, I here with send you five pieces
of metal once portions of one of our turbines. I have placed these
pieces in the box in the same relative position which they occupied
when they made a part of the turbine.            To make my statement

screws working in the cast-iron frame which is bolted to the stone
floor of the turbine-pit. In the Tremont turbine this floor is of
wood, and in plate 1 the steady-pin is marked “I.’
   “The pieces sent are marked Nos. 1 to 5. No. 1 is the portion
of the steady-pin which was nearest the shaft; No. 2 the other ex
tremity of the same pin ; Nos. 3, 4, 5 the three pieces of case
hardened iron forming the box, with portions of this steady-pin at
tached.   You will at once perceive that this steel has been partially
fused, and can thus account for its attachment to the iron.
   “The facts are, that on noticing some irregularities of motion on
the part of the wheel, it was stopped, and the water pumped from
the pit until the floor was bare.   Inspection showed that the follow
ing-screws had not done their duty uniformly; and the three pieces,
Nos. 3, 4, 5, no longer preserved their proper relative positions, nor
allowed free play to the steady-pin.        The consequence was, an
amount of friction   causing heat sufficient to fuse steel, although the
latter was immersed 3 feet deep in a raceway 10 feet wide, through
which was passing 75 cubic feet of water per second.
   “A similar accident happened thrice to our turbines, which are
now, however, safely guarded against such mishaps.”
   There are two points in connexion with these facts to which I
wish especially to call attention. In the first place, the weight of
the wheel did not rest upon the surfaces of friction. The three pieces
of case-hardened iron in their displaced position acted simply as a
brake upon the revolving shaft; so that the heat must have resulted
wholly from the destruction of mechanical motion : the immense
moving-power of the wheel, instead of being directed wholly into
its appropriate channel, was       part transformed into that mode                         of
atomic motion called heat.               In in
                                 the second place, the temperature
attained was    at
               least the welding-point   iron, and this, too, although
                                                     of
the heated metal was immersed        stream   inflowing water.

undoubtedly true that the spheroidal condition       the water would of
greatly retard the loss      heat; but still the loss must have been
                               of
exceedingly rapid.     Now the loss, even        the highest temperature
                                                      by

                                               the heat generated during
the same time; and this must, therefore, have been evolved with
equal rapidity   atthe surfaces           of
                                    friction. No change         the mole   in

sufficient to account for this continuous, prolonged, and immensely
rapid evolution      heat; and the facts force upon
                     of                                               us

NOTE REGARDING THE DECREASE OF ACTINIC EFFECT NEAR THE
  CIRCUMFERENCE of THE SUN, As show N BY THE KEw PIC
  TURES.  BY MESSRs. WARREN DE LA RUE, STEwART, AND
  LOEWY.
   The remarks which we ventured to make in the last para
graph of our “Results on Solar Physics,” recently published, have
induced   us to examine the Kew pictures, as regards the decrease of
actinic effect from the centre to the circumference of the sun, to
which decrease we may give the name of atmospheric effect, since it
is without doubt caused by the presence of a comparatively cold
solar atmosphere.                   -
    In conformity with our views, this atmospheric effect ought to be
greater at the epoch of maximum than at that of minimum spot-fre
quency; and furthermore, if there is any reference to ecliptical lon
gitudes in the behaviour of spots—that is to say, if at any time the
spots on the sun attain their maximum at any ecliptical longitude—
there ought (according to these views) to be a greater amount of
absorbing atmosphere at the same longitude, since such an atmo
sphere is supposed conducive to the outbreak of spots.
    There is reason to think that spots attain their maximum in the
 ecliptical longitude opposite to that where Venus exists; so that we
 might expect (according to these views) a diminution in atmospheric
 effect in the same longitude as Venus, and an increase in the effect
 in the longitude opposite to Venus.
   If therefore Venus be at the longitude of the left limb of the
sun, this limb should exhibit less atmospheric effect than the right
limb; and if Venus be at the right limb, we should have most atmo
spheric effect at the left limb.
   It is only the under-exposed pictures that are available for a re
search of this nature, since an over-exposure tends to do away with
the atmospheric effect.
   Without giving any hint of our views, Mr. Beckley was requested
to select some of the last Kew pictures taken in 1859, a year of
maximum spot-frequency, and to compare them with those taken in
 1864 and 1865, periods of minimum spot-frequency;    and he came to
the conclusion that there was more atmospheric effect in 1859 than
in the years 1864 and 1865.
    Furthermore, Mr. Stewart, in conjunction with Miss Beckley, has
 looked over    all
                 the pictures taken    Kew from May 1863
                                       at                      to

XXXVIII.      On the Composition of Forces. By John STEveLLY,
   LL.D.,    Professor of Natural Philosophy, Queen's College,
   Belfast 4.
 IT parallelogram
      is well known that the very beautiful demonstration of “the
                      of forces” given by the immortal Laplace is
too intricate, and depends too much on advanced knowledge of
the differential and integral calculus and trigonometry, to be
used in the instruction of mere beginners in the study of me
chanical philosophy.
   It has lately occurred to me that a most simple and almost
immediate deduction from “Laplace's principle” would prove
the parallelogram of forces in the case where the directions of
the components contain a right angle—from which case to the
general theorem, when the directions of the two components con
tain any angle at the material particle on which they simulta
neously act, is but one easy step, +and that nothing but the ex
treme facility with which this master of analysis used the instru
ments of his art could have caused him to overlook this almost
obvious and very simple method of proving what he takes about
two quarto pages to deduce.       It also proves at once the first and
most   important  part  of Poisson’s proof of the parallelogram of
forces, which, however, is scarcely anything more than a transla
tion of D'Alembert's very elaborate geometrical proof into the
language of algebraists and trigonometricians.
   I shall therefore, with the permission of the editors of the
Philosophical Magazine, give a simple geometrical proof of La
place's principle, and the deduction from it which leads to the
general theorem, premising one or two preliminary points for
the sake of those readers who may be less familiarly acquainted
with the subject.

and the resultant of any other two components which act respec
tively in the same lines of direction and bear the same ratio to
each other, will be in the same direction, and will bear to the re
sultant of the former pair the same ratio as that of either pair of
homologous forces of the two pairs of components.          (1) For
let    P and Q   be two forces which act together on a material point
in    directions making any given angle, a second P and a second
Q acting respectively in the      same directions, would of course
have an    equal resultant,  say   R, acting in the same direction
as before, and therefore 2P with 20 would have a resultant 2R,
still in the same direction.     The same argument applies to 3P
with 30, 4P with 4Q, and nP with nG), having for resultant nE
in the same direction still. Again,                            ; with ;          must

resultant in the same direction ; for if not, the resultant R of P
with Q must be different either in direction or magnitude, or
both, from what it                  is.   The same argument applies                           to:   with

   IV. We shall now proceed to prove that the direction of the
resultant of two forces P and Q, whose directions contain a right
angle and which act together on the material point A, is that of
the diagonal of the rectangle whose sides represent P and Q
respectively; or, what comes to the same thing, if the two forces
P and Q which act together at A are represented in direction
and magnitude by the two sides of a right-angled triangle taken
in order (A B and BD), the hypothemuse A D (taken not in
order, or) acting from A to D represents the direction of their
resultant, as               its

D. A. C. Then, if again we draw A Ds bisecting the angle D2AC,
it can be shown by a precisely similar argument to that already

Gº,         and Lettsom doubt whether or not Wulfenite may
        rank as a British species.  In Thomson’s “Mineralogy,’
vol. i. p. 565, we find the following remarks on a specimen (a
single specimen) in the possession of the Stockholm Academy:—
“It   was ticketed lead-spar, from Mendip, near Churchhill in
Somersetshire; it was chiefly carbonate of lead, but it contained
two portions of a yellower colour than the rest, which attracted
the particular attention of Berzeliust. One of these being exa
mined by the blowpipe, proved to be molybdate of lead. The
other portion was an oxido-chloride of lead.”

   This, so far as know, is the only published record of the
occurrence of this substance in Britain.     Lately a new pit was
 sunk for some 30 fathoms at the “South of Scotland Mines” at
Lackentyre, near Gateshead in Kirkcudbrightshire;     and among
several interesting minerals brought   me thence   by  Mr. James
Russel of Airdrie, there was a single specimen of the molybdate.
The associated minerals are galena, carbonate and phosphate of
lead, and cupreous calamine; the molybdate occurs in well-pro
nounced and unusually brilliantly polished crystals of about one
eighth of an inch in size;
the forms are c s n and
cs   n   m; the faces n and
m   are very narrow : the    m
crystals are thin, transpa

   These considerations led M. Edlund                 study more closely     to

currents.        We shall give              a   brief analysis

   An induction-current can scarcely have any other properties
than those         of    an
                     ordinary galvanic current whose intensity                                                       is
constantly changing.           was easyIt   foresee, therefore, that the

256               M. E. Edlund on        the Heat disengaged
duction,    as much heat as the induced current produces in the
same time.       But the heat which escapes is proportional to the
excess of temperature if the latter is inconsiderable.             Hence the
heat   developed    in a  given    time  by  the induced current is pro
portional to the excess of temperature.            M. Edlund has shown
by previous experiments that the thermoelectric current, and
therefore the deviation which it produces in the galvanometer,
are proportional to the excess of temperature *, provided the
latter is small.       It follows from this that the deflection of the
galvanometer is proportional to the heat disengaged in a given
time by the platinum wire.            After having shown the truth of
this  proposition    by  special   experiments,   and proved moreover by
other experiments that the indications of the dynamometer are
proportional     to  Jºdl,   the author made several experiments to
determine the heat disengaged by induced currents.                  The fol
lowing are some of them:—
    In a first series of experiments the dynamometer was in con
nexion with the internal coil; the dynamometer was then re
moved and replaced in the circuit by a platinum wire. After
having determined the development of heat in the platinum wire
by means of the thermoelectric pile and the galvanometer, seve
ral observations were again made with the dynamometer. These
experiments were made with inducing currents of different inten
                                               gº
sities.   The following are the means of the results obtained:—

  There is thus perfect proportionality between the quantities
of heat disengaged by the induced currents, and the deflection
which these produce in the dynamometer.    The same result was
obtained when the duration of the induced currents was altered,
the intensity of the inducing current being kept constant. With
this view a second special spring was fixed to the toothed wheel,
so as to close another circuit at the moment at which the bat
tery was cut off by the other spring at the opening of the cur
rent.    The extra current, produced in the induction-çoil on
opening the battery, had time to act, and had the effect of
making the diminution of the inducing current on opening take
place far more slowly than in case there was no secondary cir
cuit. This arrangement produced no change in the induction
current produced by closing the circuit.    In order, lastly, to vary
the duration of the induced current, an extra induction-coil
was introduced at first into the inducing current, in which
was a soft iron cylinder.    The effect of this latter on the indu
cing current was to diminish              its
                                   increase                  on
                                              closing. This induc
tion-coil was      so
                  distant from that       which was produced the
                                                       in

                                                 action could take
place between them.                 In
                            order that the quantity        heat pro           of
duced should not      too small, the secondary circuit was removed.

 ment and end of the induced current as limits of the integral.
                                        III.
    An induced current naturally         exerts an action on the prin
  cipal inducing current.        Hence are formed in the latter induced
  currents of a higher order, which, according to their direc
  tion, add themselves to or subtract from the principal current.
  Thus the disengagement of heat in the inducing current while
  induction is taking place may be different from that which takes
  place during the same length of time but when no induction
  takes place. Hence, if we are to measure the heat disengaged
  by induction, we must not only measure the quantity of heat
  which the induction-current developes in a given time, but also
  that which the inducing current developes in the same time,
  first without induction, and then while it is inducing.                   The
  experiments were arranged in the following manner with a view
  to this object.
      The toothed wheel was turned with a constant velocity, making
  an entire turn in a second; and on the stroke of the fortieth second
, the deflection in the galvanometer produced by the thermoelec
  tric current was observed.           To determine the disengagement
  of heat due to the induced         current,  the platinum wire to which
  the thermoelectric pile was attached was interposed in the                          in
  duced current; it was then removed and placed in the prin
  cipal inducing current.        After that, the disengagement of heat
   was examined anew in the platinum wire, first when the induced
  circuit was open and when no induction took place, and then
                                 is,  while under the inducing action
                                                                                      byof
   when it was closed, that
  the   principal  circuit.   Thus measure
                                      a               of
                                                     the heat developed

 last numbers, or 11:58, represents the lessened disengagement
 of heat by the principal current when the latter induces a cur
rent in another conducting wire. But the numbers 11:58 and
 2875 (obtained by the induced current) only represent the
disengagement of heat in the platinum wire, and give no account
of the disengagement in the other parts of the two circuits.
 Hence by comparing these two numbers we cannot know whether
 an induction of this kind really produces heat.          But for the
 same current the disengagement of heat is proportional to the
resistance of the circuit, and that not merely for metallic con
ductors, but also for liquids.      Hence, if we multiply 28:75 by
the resistance of the induced circuit, and 11:58 by the resist
ance of the principal current, the first of these products will
represent the total heat disengaged in the induced current,
and the second the difference in the heat developed in the prin
 cipal circuit when the latter induces and when it does not. If
 M is the resistance of the principal current, we find by experi
 ment that the resistance of the induced current is 0.4405 M.
These two quantities of heat may therefore be represented by
 28.75 x 0.4405 M, and 11.58 M. The first gives 12.66 M, and
 may be regarded as being quite equal to the second; from
 which it follows that this kind of induction does not give rise to
a production of heat.                                             -
    Two other series of observations led to the same result; in the
first, the heat disengaged by the induced current was 12:36 M,
and the difference of the heat disengaged by the principal cur
rent during induction and without induction was 13:21 M. In
the second series 9:52 M was obtained for the first arrangement,
 and 9.63 M for the second. These results prove that when in
duced currents are produced in a closed circuit by opening and
closing the principal inducing circuit, the induction gives rise neither
to an increase nor to a diminution of heat.      The quantity of heat
developed by the induced current is equal to the lessened produc
tion of heat which takes place in the principal current owing to
this induction.
                                  IV.
    In  order, by bringing a secondary circuit near an inducing
current or by removing it away, to obtain an induced current
so strong that the heat which it disengaged could be measured,
a special apparatus was constructed.       It consisted of a fixed coil
of  copper  wire covered   by silk, the interior diameter of which
was 200 millims. In the inside of this was another, also covered
with silk, which by suitable mechanism could be made to rotate
rapidly about an axis in the plane of the first coil. The ends of

260                On the Heat disengaged by Induction-currents.
the wire of the moveable     coil were in metallic connexion with
the ends of the axis of rotation.       These were provided with
springs that could be connected with wires through which passed
the induced current produced by the rotation.           The prin
cipal inducing current, whose intensity was constant, always
passed in these experiments through the fixed external coil.
 When the internal coil was rotating, it produced an induced
current in the fixed coil.      It is readily understood that the
induced current is    always   in a direction such that the mu
tual action of this current and of the principal inducing current
exerts a resistance to the rotatory motion, and that this resist
ance must be overcome by the mechanical force which makes
the coil rotate. An expenditure of mechanical force therefore
accompanies the induction; and this expenditure of mechanical
force, as can easily be seen, is proportional to the square of the
intensity of the principal current so long as the velocity of rota
tion is constant.
   The experiments were made in the following way. The ends
of the inner coil were in the first place connected with the
platinum wire on which the thermoelectric pile was placed. After
that the interior coil was made to rotate, and when the velocity
of rotation was constant (forty-five turns in a second), the exterior
coil was connected with the voltaic battery, the rotation being
continued for thirty seconds; the battery was disconnected, and
after a lapse of twenty seconds the deflection produced in the
galvanometer by the thermoelectric current was read off. This
deflection was a measure of the quantity of heat disengaged by
the induced current during thirty seconds.     That being done,
two similar  experiments  were made, with the simple difference
that in the principal current was inserted the platinum wire
        its
          thermoelectric pile.            In
with                              one           it of
                                         two series the internal
bobbin was rotating;              in
                           the other     was     rest;    that at             so         in
one case there was induction, and              in
                                       the other not.   By means
of  the two latter series  measure was obtained        the quan          of
tity    heat disengaged           in a
                            thirty seconds                by
                                               the principal cur
rent  in of
        the case    which there was induction, and
                            in                            that                in         in
which there was not.       Now      was found that the principal
                                          it
current produced the same quantity                  of
                                            heat whether       did            it         or
did not act  inductively.          In
                               one series            of
                                             observations      deflec          a
tion  of166-6 was obtained without, and          166:9 with induc
                                                          of
tion.  The disengagement          heat   of     in
                                           the induced circuit                           in
the same series was 49-3.     Hence induction      the kind   ofques               in
tion produces          an
                   excess         of
                             heat, and this excess     exactly equalis
to  the heat which the induced current       disengages.     But the
heat disengaged              by
                       the induced current      proportional
                                                         is        the              to
square        of
            the intensity          of
                              the induced   current;    and  this,                       in

   On the Diminution of Direct Solar Heat in the Atmosphere.     261
 accordance with the general laws of induction, is proportional to
 the intensity of the principal current.     The excess of heat ob
 tained by this kind of induction is proportional to the square of
 the intensity of the principal current.    On the other hand, the
 square of the intensity of the principal current is proportional to
 the mechanical force used in surmounting the resistance which
 the inducing and induced currents exert on being approached to
 or removed away from each other. Hence it follows that, when
 induced currents are produced by approaching or separating the
 induced and the inducing circuit, heat is produced by induc
 tion.   In this case the production of heat is proportional to the
mechanical force eaerted in approaching the two circuits or in sepa
rating them.
    The author has proved by a mathematical deduction, which
cannot be reproduced here, that the variation in the disengage
 ment of heat of the principal current arises from induction-cur
rents of a higher order which are produced by the primary
current.

    Regions of the Atmosphere. By J. M. WILSON, M.A., F.G.S.,

       GENTLEMEN,
    N the March Number of the Philosophical         Magazine    Pro
       fessor Tyndall has drawn attention to a note of mine in the
previous Number, on an observation of Mr. Glaisher’s respect
ing the readings of the shaded and exposed thermometers at
great heights.
    Professor Tyndall restates my conclusions, and, not admitting
them, however fairly drawn, to be representative of natural facts,
suggests a possible source of error in the observations arising
from a supposed small capacity of the black-bulb thermometer
for absorbing the invisible solar rays. I will not occupy your
space by quoting Professor Tyndall’s statement, but referring to
it would remark that, even granting any amount of transparency
to the invisible rays on the part of the black bulb, the pheno
menon noticed by Mr. Glaisher cannot be thus accounted for,
as far as    I see at present, without adopting my conclusions
which Professor Tyndall quotes. He is doubtless right in say
ing that the indications of the black-bulb thermometer are more

 itsreadings; but the special failure   the black bulb which he         of

   For    ifthe black bulb were opake          the visible and transpa     to

much heat again from the sun as we actually do receive.       And                                       I
know    too, by  personal   experience, as does Professor  Tyndall,
how at great heights one feels sensations commonly attributed
to solar radiation; and the conclusions in my last paper, which
seemed to contradict these and multitudes of other facts which
occur to everyone, surprised me and staggered mc,           confess.                      I
But the truth is that the contradiction lies between, not the
facts, but the received interpretations of the facts; and when
this is the case, the interpretations must be reexamined; and the
process is one which leads to discoveries.
   Whatever hypothesis is offered, the fact remains, that at great
elevations the shaded and exposed bulb show very nearly the
same very low reading, so low that it may be presumed that they
would show the same reading exactly if they could be taken to a
sufficiently great height.    Mr. Glaisher, will repeat, reasserted  I
this, in the most explicit manner, as based on very numerous
and entirely concordant observations both of the black-bulb
thermometer and water-actinometer.
   The only explanation that I can suggest that is based on
known physical actions is the following.
     If
      the black-bulb thermometer does not indicate the direct
radiated heat, it may be that it loses it by instantaneous radia
tion.    It is contrary to our experience that this instantaneous
radiation is due to diminished pressure; but it may be due to
the nearly total absence of aqueous vapour.           It is the presence
of the atmosphere, and especially          aqueous vapour, that pro
                                                            its

may         be

     Professor Tyndall says, in his “Heat considered as a Mode of
Motion,’ p. 389, “The withdrawal of the sun from any region
over which the atmosphere is dry must be followed by quick re
frigeration.    The moon would be rendered entirely uninhabit
able   by beings  like ourselves through the operation of this single
cause: with an outward radiation, uninterrupted by aqueous
vapour, the difference between her monthly maxima and minima
must be enormous.”            If the radiation were instantaneous,
 Mr. Glaisher’s observation indicates that the surface would
not be heated; it may not be safe to extend this to rough
surfaces, as to sand, as it is conceivable that the reciprocal radia
tion among the particles may be communicated to the mass; but
except on some such insecure ground as this (rejecting, as
 before, the hypothesis of the non-existence of heat, as such, in
stellar space),    I  see no way for reconciling the above infer
ence of Professor Tyndall, or the similar remarks by Herschel
 (Outlines of Astronomy, S. 431), with Mr. Glaisher’s obser
vation.
     I have selected the comparison between the bright and dark
halves of the half moon as an example which gives a pointed
illustration of the difference between my view and the received
 opinions: it seems paradoxical; but is it contrary, not only to
opinions and to inferences, but to facts : In suggesting it I con
fess I see less ground for hesitation in the physical difficulty of
the view than in the mere fact of differing from two such autho
 rities as I have quoted against myself, from whom        I can only
 differ with a mental reservation that further thought and more
 study on my part would probably bring me to adopt their con
clusions. .   I trust that Professor Tyndall will continue to give
his attention to this interesting subject.

of the day. Also the east and west current will be more intense
than the opposite current developed in corresponding posi
tions. At the close of a day, a certain resultant current for
each place should remain, running from east to west.       As the
obliquity of the ecliptic to the meridian at the hour of noon
at any place is continually changing during the year, this result
ant current must be continually changing                  direction. This              its

will be sensibly the sum of the individual actions, and will be
perpendicular to the line proceeding from the middle of the
magnet. The directive action of the earth will be virtually this.
   This being allowed, it follows, as deduced in the former paper,
that, except in high latitudes, the needle will be perpendicular
to the lines of equal molecular magnetic intensity; also that the
horizontal directive force exerted by the earth will be propor
tional, or nearly so, at each station to the molecular magnetic
intensity; and the vertical force approximately proportional
to the difference of these intensities on one side and the other of
the lines of equal force. It may be added here that the above
conception brings our theory into essential correspondence (from
the mechanical point of view) with Gauss’s, and thus that the
conclusions of his memoir become deducible from the present
physical theory.
   If  we conceive the magnetic force of the earth to be wholly
due to the direct action of the electric currents circulating from
molecule to molecule, the force exerted by each element of the
current should be of the same character, and have a similar direc
tion to that in the case just supposed.      But since the resultant
currents are shifting their position from year to year, it follows
that they may differ somewhat from the lines of equal molecular
force.    In the sequel we shall in general, for greater simplicity
and distinctness of conception, regard the magnetic action of the
earth as due to the primary currents, developed as before ex
plained.    If these give place, either wholly or in part, to mole
cular  currents,  the results will be essentially the same.
   Distribution of Terrestrial Magnetism.—The inequality in the
distribution of the magnetism of the earth, upon the same pa
rallel of latitude, may be supposed to arise from differences of
conductibility in different parts of the earth.      It is conceivable
that such differences may exist as a consequence of the exist
ence of two great systems of continental elevations, and that
the magnetic condition of the earth may be represented by sup
posing that two sets of currents, originating in these elevations,
are superimposed upon those which are due to the undisturbed
condition of thc crust of the earth.    But there is another con
ception that may be formed of the possible origin of the unequal
distribution of the earth’s magnetism, which does not involve
the supposition of unequal conductibility.    It is that the present
magnetic state of the earth originated at a remote period in the
history of the earth, when it was still in the process of conden
sation, and  its period    rotation was much longer than
                            of                                  pre  at

of the tropical year, n being an even number, the same region
of the earth’s surface would at the close of each successive year
be, for a considerable interval of time about the autumnal equi
nox, on the opposite side of the earth from the sun, and thus
would come to be traversed by strong currents running from N.
of E. to S. of W. (p. 273); also that at each successive vernal
equinox the same region would be on the side of the earth

matical exposition was given of the formal relations subsisting
between the principles of magnetism and heat in the crust of the
earth, based upon certain mechanical ideas.       We have already
seen (p. 267) that the fundamental ideas then assumed are in
essential accordance with the present theory of the origin of
terrestrial magnetism.     It may now be added that the mathe
matical relations shown to subsist between the intensity of the
magnetic action and the temperature may be seen to have a
physical basis. The dependence here alluded to arises from the
fact that the electric currents developed by the impulsive action
of the aether of space within the crust of the earth must, to a
certain extent, pass off in the form of heat, and that the earth
may derive a large portion of              its
                                      heat from this source.                                     In

toward the east.     Strictly the two sets of ecliptic currents, the
one  having   an easterly  and the other a westerly trend, will be
developed at various points on one side and the other of the
circle of intersection with the earth of a plane passing through
the most advanced point and the geographical pole.       The special
currents developed on the circle    perpendicular  to this will have
the greatest intensity on the side opposite to the sun, as already
shown.     The effects of the diverse currents, originating in the
impulsive action of the aether of space upon the preceding half
of the earth, are conspicuously observable in the variations of
the declination and horizontal force during the last half of the
night and the earlier part of the day. As the day advances, the
radial photosphericcurrents (see Silliman's Journal, vol.xix. p. 190)
come into more effective action, and greatly modify the magnetic
variations that would result from the currents just mentioned.
They augment the diminution of the horizontal force in the fore.
noon, and deflect the needle further to the west at midday *.
They are also the principal cause of the increase of the horizontal
force in the afternoon.     The change of the hours of the morning
maxima and minima with the seasons is mainly a consequence
of the changes experienced, during the year, in the position of
the circle of the earth perpendicular to the radius of the earth's
orbit at 6 A.M., with respect to a meridian passing through
the most advanced point of the earth's surface at that hour.
The circle in question coincides with the meridian at the two
equinoxes, is inclined 23%." to it on the west side at the summer
solstice, and under the same angle on the east side at the winter
solstice.    In consequence of the change of position of this circle,
the radial currents tend to alter the critical hours above referred
to.    For the rest, it should be observed that the phenomena
all  show that the temporary currents           which they are pro

radial photospheric currents are chiefly effective between the
hours of 6 A.M. and 6 P.M., though their influence extends,
especially during the summer, into the earlier and later hours of
the night.   In their effect upon the declination, the marked ten
dency of the first set of currents is to deflect the needle toward
the east for a certain interval of time before and after 6 A.M.,
while the conspicuous tendency of the second is to deflect the
needle toward the west for a certain interval about the middle of
the day. Another effect of the latter set of currents                when                          is,

   This conception of the origin of the irregular disturbances
links them theoretically, as they are in fact, on one side with
the physical changes observed in the photosphere of the sun,
and on the other with the auroral phenomena that occur in
the photosphere of the earth.    It contemplates the corusca
tions of the aurora and the sympathetic tremblings of the mag
netic needle, as but one phase of the “magnetic storm’ of
subtile vapour that descends upon the earth from the regions
of space.
   One of the most conspicuous facts relative to the disturbances
under consideration                   is,
                            that the disturbances        the horizontal    of

                          intensity prevail,                         all
                                                      hours, over those

which augment              it.
                       This fact may        attributed, from our pre

sent stand-point,     the circumstance that the descending masses
of auroral matter,           in to
                       receiving the velocity      rotation     the pho

tosphere      theofearth,  must  generate    electric currents         pro                    or
gressive waves directed toward the west.          There    still another       is
effect that theoretically should result from the arrival              these               of
cosmical masses. The electrical excitation that should            thereby

electric aether that pervades the earth’s crust, and thus originate
the currents supposed, the consequent effects upon the decli
nation and horizontal force should be of the same character,
if not of equal amount, at midnight and at noon. Besides,
the moon by this sort of action should produce greater effects
than the sun. The moon, as a matter of fact, does exercise
a disturbing action upon the magnetic needle, but the pertur
bations produced by it have only been detected by the closest
scrutiny.
   We may here take occasion to remark that the lunar-diurnal
variations of the declination and of the horizontal force are, in
their nature, such as should result from a tidal action of the
moon upon the terrestrial sea of electric aether. Thus there
should be theoretically a maximum of west declination at the
upper culmination, or thereabout, and another maximum at the
lower culmination.    There should also be a maximum of hori
zontal force a few hours after each culmination, and a minimum
 a few hours before each culmination; for the rise and fall of
 the electrical tide should be attended with currents, or rather
 waves of translation, setting from                           all

 it may be seen that the secular variations of the declination
result from the combined operation of two causes, viz.:
    (1) The prevailing annual action of the resultant E. and W.
current, or of the resultant N. and S. current, according to the
declination of the needle; except when the declination is easterly,
when the two currents will cooperate.

But the needle will not, in fact, remain stationary when this po
 sition has been reached; this could not be the case unless the
 effects of the varying resultants of the new and old currents
 should exactly counterbalance each other.            In reality those on
the east side should       preponderate    over those on the west side,
 because they will be more displaced and the currents of im
 pulses proceeding from the same number of points will corre
 spond more nearly in direction on the east than on the west
 side. The tendency of the second general cause should then
 be to give the needle at Philadelphia a motion toward the east
 in the magnetic position in which it would otherwise remain
 stationary.
     If  we now revert to London as a type-station for Western
 Europe, the present easterly movement of the needle should
 continue until the magnetic position of the more easterly of the
 two neutral points so-called is reached.            But at this position
 the resultant currents at places lying to the west should, in
 the existing condition of the currents of the eastern continent,
 preponderate over those lying to the east, and the easterly
 movement should therefore continue. The continued operation
 of the second general cause may thus keep up an easterly move
 ment until the needle attains to a certain easterly declination.
 But the direct tendency to a westerly movement that increases
 as the easterly declination becomes greater, must ultimately
 prevail, and the needle begin to turn toward the west.
     It is obvious that the general result is the same as if the
 whole system of currents were gradually transferred to the west;
 or the representative sinuous curve had such a motion, its folds
 at the same time changing more or less.             Or rather, to obtain
a comprehensive view of the entire process, we should conceive
 of a system of such representative curves traversing the earth’s
 surface at various distances from the equator, and suppose the
 whole system to be carried bodily toward the west.
     To explain completely the secular variations, especially of the
 horizontal force, we must take into account another cause in ope
 ration not yet mentioned.        It is that the resultant currents at
 any station may either be increasing or decreasing in intensity
 from year to year, for the reason that the annual diminution of
intensity of currents already existing may be over-compensated
 by the new currents, or the reverse”.              During the period of
 over-compensation or of increasing intensity, the period of the
 secular change of declination should increase, and decrease in the
    * A tendency to a diminution of the horizontal force may arise from two
causes, viz. a gradual decline of existing currents, and an increase in the
ecliptic photospheric currents developed by the impact of the auroral mat
.er received from the sun.

succeeding period.     Since it appears, from Mr. Scott's discus
 sion of the secular variations (see Report of Coast Survey for
 1855, p. 337), that the secular period is shortening on the west
ern coast of the Atlantic, we have to infer that we are at present
in that magnetic phase in which the reinforcement of intensity
from the new currents is less than the annual diminution.        In
this circumstance we have the     probable  explanation  of the an
nual diminution of the horizontal force in the United States and
Canada. An increase of the photospheric currents may cooperate.
    Another general principle should be had distinctly in mind
in this connexion : it is that the action of the auroral matter re
ceived from the sun upon the photosphere of the earth developes
there a system of currents, the tendency of which should be the
reverse of that of the corresponding system continually developed
in the crust of the earth by the aether of space. The relative
direction in which the solar matter approaches the earth is also
approximately the same as that of the impulsive action of the
aether—only that, in proportion as the velocity of recess from the
sun is greater, the direction of approach is displaced toward the
sun.    As already intimated, the impinging solar matter also de
velopes radial currents by direct action propagated to the crust
of the earth. This effect we have recognized in the partial de
pendence of the morning variation of the declination, and of the
horizontal force, upon the eleven-year period of the sun's spots.
It is also strikingly manifest in determining the principal de
flections of the needle during an aurora borealis, at the same
time that the ecliptic and equatorial currents from east to west
developed in the photosphere have the effect of diminishing the
horizontal force.   This supposed action of the solar matter upon
the crust of the earth may arise either from the direct propaga
tion of the impulses, as already intimated, or, more probably,
from an increase in the density of the aether, resulting from the
acceleration of the fall of the matter in question, produced by the
earth’s attraction.
   The secular variations should also be dependent in some de
gree upon the electric currents due to the solar matter.    In fact
there is abundant evidence of such dependence.           The annual
rates of variation of to   the magnetic elements vary during the
                      a as all
eleven-year period,       they should    do  upon this supposition.

prohibitory statutes have issued, but from the theory of uniform
and constant saturation.      This theory, which is now taking a
very definite form, and which appears to be the highest generali
zation yet attained to in chemistry, has been drifted into, as it
were, during the last ten years.     Its nature may be explained as
follows.    Every atom of which matter is composed has a con
stant and invariable capacity of saturation (which differs accord
ing to the kind of matter); and in whatever form of combina
tion the atom happens to be placed, it is always in a state of
perfect saturation.    Impossible forms of combination are obvi
ously forms in which atoms are represented as not saturated.
   Sometimes the atom is saturated with atoms unlike itself, and
sometimes it is saturated with atoms like itself.   The saturation
by a similar kind of atom may be complete or partial; but when
partial, the deficiency must be made up by the presence of other
atoms. When two or more similar atoms effect a partial saturation
of one another, there results a kind of compound atom—incapable
of isolated existence, and requiring the presence of a suitable
number of atoms. Complications of structure are produced by
partial saturations of this kind. The most complete exemplifi
cation of the theory is afforded by the hydrocarbons.    The atom
of carbon   requires four atoms of  hydrogen to saturate    There         it.
is only one hydrocarbon known whose structure offers only one
atom   of carbon   in union with hydrogen.    This hydrocarbon                          is
marsh-gas, CH*. There are multitudes         hydrocarbons besides,

four,  or two atoms     ofhydrogen for their saturation.      Thus two

    Although the Gerhardt type theory is a most palpable perver
 sion  of fact, for organic compounds fall quite      as naturally under
 three dozen     general types   as under these favoured three, and
 although it has been abandoned with surprising rapidity, and
 although, like the simple compound-radical theory of Berzelius
 and Liebig, it simply accepts a multitude of radicals without
 offering any explanation of their structure, yet it has completely
 changed the aspect of the science.          It was put forward in a
 most    splendid   manner,  and   brought   into prominence many of
the most fundamental doctrines,        e.g., that the elements are not
composed of isolated atoms, but of groups of similar atoms; that
chemical change consists in the vast majority of cases in double
decomposition; that the occupation of equal volumes in the state
of vapour is an excellent sign of the relative magnitudes of che
mical groups; and much besides which            I have no time to point
out.
    The other attempt was that of Kolbe and Frankland, who
more than ten years ago had made the practical discovery of the
real saturating capacity of carbon, and who recognized that by
simple double decomposition the homologous series of alcohols
and acids might be built up. It is a remarkable fact, that
although Kolbe and Frankland were actually employing methods
the validity of which depended upon the fact that the saturating
power of the atom of carbon is equal to four of hydrogen, it
should have been reserved for Kekulé to make the announce
ment that if we assign to carbon a fundamental saturating power
equal that of four atoms of hydrogen, we are able to exhibit
organic compounds with the form of their structure deducible
from the fundamental saturating power of the carbon which they
Contain.
XLIV.      Note on the Periodical Changes of Orbit, under certain
    circumstances, of a particle acted on by a central force, and on Vec
    torial Coordinates, &c., together with a new Theory of the Ana
    logues to the Cartesian Ovals in Space, being a Sequel to “As
    tronomical Prolusions.”      By Prof.  J.  J. SylvestER, F.R.S.*
A       VERY     singular and previously unnoticed species of dis
         continuity arises when, according to the equations of
motion interpreted in the ordinary manner, a particle solicited
by a continuous central force would seem as if it ought to describe
an orbit external to the force-centre.        An instance of this kind,
probably for the first time, presented itself in a question inci
dentally brought forward by myself in the paper inserted in the
                    * Communicated by   the Author.

January Number of this Magazine, where alluded, in passing, to                  I
the case of a body acted on by a central force capable of making
it move in a circle exterior to the force-centre, and fell into the
not unnatural error, which has since been pointed out to me, and
which is obvious on a moment’s reflection, of stating that on
arriving at a point where the motion points to the force-centre,
i. e. at the point where the tangent to the circle passes through
this centre, the particle would go off in a straight line on account
of the motion and the force coinciding in direction. But it is clear
      -        -                     d        -     -            -
that since theinstantaneous area ºp”    remains finite at such point,
it cannot abruptly    become zero; the radial velocity becoming
infinite, does not entitle us to reject the transverse part which
remains finite; thus the radius vector p will continue to revolve
in the same direction as before it reached the tangential point;
it will therefore swing off to another curve, so that the true orbit
will possess an inflexion at that point. The new curve, it may
easily be proved, will be a circle equal to the former, and related
 to it in the manner following:                               let     the force                 be

Thus, ea. gr., if the angular sector be 72°, the orbit will be
   P, Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, Q, P, &c.
   In like manner, if the angle included                            between the tangents be
any commensurable part of 360°, as

integers prime to one another, the orbit will be a closed one
containing mn alternate segments, or mn entire circles, according
as n is even or odd.  By taking n even and giving many arbi
trary odd value, a waving line will be produced forming an ori
ginal and, I think, elegant pattern for a circular lace border.
For this purpose             * should not be                 too small,        in order that the
disproportion between the alternate circular segments and the
ratio of the border to the interior may not be so great as to
offend the eye; and m not too great, in order that the traces of
the pattern may not become too complicated.
   I conjecture that [m =3; n=64] and [m-5; n = 128], pro
ducing respectively 3 and 5 twists, and 5 or 6 and 6 or 7 flex
ures within a quadrant of each twist, would be eligible systems
for the purpose.     In general n ought to be even, and m a large
moderate odd integer.
   If  the angle between the tangents to the circle from the force
centre be not an aliquot or commensurable part of 360°, the
orbit will be a non-reentrant curve intersecting itself an infinite
number of times. Similar or analogous conclusions are of course
applicable to every case where the orbit, seemingly indicated by
the equations of motion, is an oval,                          or,

In the “Prolusions.” raised the question of determining the
force at a focus required to make a body move in such oval.
This may easily be solved by aid of vectorial coordinates; and
as it seems desirable to place on record the tangential affections
of a curve expressed in terms of such coordinates, which am                                                            I

the purpose. The results will be seen to be of great use in sim
plifying the solution of the important problem of determining
the most general motion of a body attracted to two or more fixed
centres, a problem to which I purpose hereafter to return.

  be a linear function
          This linear relation we can establish a priori; for we have
                   gy-H  Aar-
                   y+*= V/
                                    2–
                           of A* when each is regarded as a function of

                                    #144 (*-*)(l +P*).
 Hence making       a =0, we     have
               (5a”–4cº),”—(5cº–4a”)A*-i-8(a”—cº)=0.
 If we are     content to leave the integral irrational in A or p    re
 spectively, then it presents itself under the form of a biquadratic
 rational equation in u and v. Combining the above construction
 of the integral with the well-known one through spherical trian
 gles, we obtain an interesting geometrical theorem, viz. that         if
 from a given spherical lune two arcs be cut off by an arc of con
 stant length, their sines may always be represented by the sum
 and difference of the distances of two fixed points from a vari
 able point in a fixed straight line; and moreover there will be
 two systems of such line and associated points.
     Besides the general integral, we have also the singular ones
 given by
                   u-a     or  v- a,    or ua-c or v- c,
 indicating the familiar proposition that the product of the focal
 distances from the tangents of an ellipse or hyperbola are con
 stant;   u-a    and v=c will correspond to an ellipse and hyper
 bola, of which the foci in the one are the vertices of the other,
 and vice versd.      If from any external point we draw a pair of
tangents to either of these curves,       #, i. e.
                                                   #% and     therefore
%     will have the same value at each point of contact; so that      if
a, a' and 8, 8' be the angles which the tangents respectively
make with the focal distances of the points of contact, we have
cos a      cos Á
                    and   also a!—a    the same in absolute magnitude
cosa!T coss'
as   8-8,     from which it is easy to infer a = 8, 2'-3', showing
that the    tangents    to an ellipse or hyperbola make equal angles
with the focal distances at the points of contact, as is also known
from the theory of confocal conics.
    In precisely the same manner we may integrate the general
equation F(2p, 24)=C, where

 rable classes of differential equations whose integrals can be determined.
  Moreover, by taking ds the element of a curve in space referred to three
 foci, ds can be expressed by aid of the theorem given in a previous foot
 note as a function of the three focal distances f,g,h and their differentials;

it would have been quite impossible to do had the ordinary sys

a rational function of the distance is a result not without interest;

given twisted Cartesian possesses an infinite number of foci,
every point that lies in a certain curve of the third degree being
a focus. When three foci are given there are four disposable
parameters, and no more, for determining this curve, which there
fore cannot be any cubic curve, but is subject to satisfy two
conditions.     This cubic curve of foci for the twisted Cartesian is
the analogue of the three focal points appertaining to the ordi
mary plane Cartesian *.

XLV.       On the Physical Cause of the Submergence and Emer
    gence   of the Land during the Glacial Epoch.         By JAMEs
    CRoll*.
        the Philosophical Magazine for last month Mr. Heath has
 IN favoured      us with a long and elaborate paper on the glacial
submergence question.        In that paper he arrives at the conclu
sion that an ice-cap placed upon the arctic regions would not
only attract the water of the ocean towards those regions, but
would also cause a similar flow of water to the south pole, pro
ducing a rise in the sea-level there also, the solid nucleus of the
globe meanwhile remaining undisturbed in the centre of the
ocean. That an ice-cap resting on the solid ground should by
its attraction cause the waters of the ocean to recede to the oppo
site side of the globe, is a conclusion so diametrically opposed to
the received principles of mechanics, that we fear there are few
physicists who will not be apt to suspect that Mr. Heath in his
reasoning must have gone astray somewhere or other. We are
inclined to think that he has been misled by adopting an erro
neous theory regarding the cause of the tides. Mr. Heath ex
plains the cause of tides as follows:—
    “The common explanation,” he says, “ of the phenomena of
the tides, by reference to the tendency of the ocean, under the
influence of the moon or sun, to assume an elliptical shape with
the long axis pointing towards the luminary and the solid nucleus
of the earth at the centre, would not be in anywise affected by
 supposing either luminary to be attached to the ‘solid mass of
the earth’ by a rod of insensible weight; whereas Mr. Croll’s
axiom would lead to the gathering up of the waters, not into
two opposite semidiurnal tides respectively under and antipodal
 to the moon, but into one globular mass under it.”
     It is perfectly true that the ordinary phenomena of the tides
 would occur just as they do at present, though the earth and
 moon were connected by a “rod of insensible weight,” pro
 vided those orbs be permitted to revolve around their common
 centre of gravity.      But stop their motion and allow them to be
 held    separate  by  the “rod,” which we presume is the idea
 Mr. Heath wishes to convey, and there would not then be two
 semidiurnal lunar tides, as he supposes, but only one on the
 side under the moon, just as my “axiom" would lead us to
 conclude.
     I  am of opinion that Mr. Heath has been misled at the very
 outset by overlooking the fact that the rise of the waters by the
  attraction of the ice-cap and the rise of the tidal wave are not
                      *  Communicated by the Author.

302        Mr.      J.    Croll on the Physical Cause of the Submergence
analogous phenomena. The rise of the ocean under the attrac
                                         I
tion of the ice-cap, as have already shown”, is a purely statical
effect, whereas the tidal wave is as much a kinetic effect as a
statical.
    He states that the principle on which             have attempted to            I
solve the   problem   is altogether    erroneous.    I had expressed the
same opinion myself regarding one part of my principle, but in
rather too unqualified termst.          From the letter of Professor W.
Thomson appended, it will be seen that had been led to abandon                I
the fundamental plan of calculation used in my original theory
somewhat too hastily.
    All those who have discussed the subject, with the exception
of Archdeacon Pratt, have assumed the earth to be a perfect
sphere previous to the-ice cap being placed upon                      shall,                  it.   I
however, assume                                                    the ice

cap.    This assumption          allowable; for      reality     ice-cap          in         an                of
the form which          shall assume actually makes the earth more

spheres after several days; under 6 atmospheres there was a
feeble but distinct reduction of silver; and under 14 atmospheres
dark-violet silver was deposited even on the next day.          A
solution of 1 part of sulphate of silver in 50 parts of water exhi
bited no decomposition under a pressure of 14 atmospheres, but
it did under a pressure of 23 atmospheres.
   Eageriments with Carbonic Acid.—A 12-per-cent. solution of
acetate of lime was enclosed in a tube with marble and hydro
chloric acid.  When the pressure of the carbonic acid given off
amounted to 14.5 atmospheres, no action was perceptible. Under
27-5 atmospheres there was, after a few days, a separation of
carbonate of lime.    In a saturated solution of acetate of lime
carbonate of lime was precipitated under a pressure of 28-5 atmo
spheres.   The latter appears in these cases, when seen under the
microscope, as globular aggregates of acicular crystals.             In
versely, marble was sealed up with excess of dilute acetic acid.
In a few days the pressure rose to 17 atmospheres, but did not
further increase even after eight months. Part of the marble
remained undissolved.      Hence the decomposition of marble by
acetic acid  stops at pretty much the same temperature as that
at which the decomposition of acetate of lime by carbonic acid
stops.
   A dilute perfectly neutral solution of chloride of calcium was
not changed under a pressure of 45 atmospheres (the tube in
this case contained condensed liquid carbonic acid); nor was
acetate of baryta under 30 atmospheres, or chloride of barium
under 60 atmospheres.
   The author’s experiments on the reducing-power of zinc and
aluminium at high temperatures are known from previous com
munications.    Whereas aluminium readily sets free barium, it
does not reduce calcium from oxychloride of calcium.         Alumi
nium can in turn be     separated     by magnesium   (from artificial
cryolite for instance).        caustic potash is heated in a gun
                              If
barrel with aluminium, globules of potassium are readily obtained.
This reaction may perhaps be applicable in practice.

   It is thus seen that almost universally the specifically lighter
metal is also the stronger.           The further the metals are apart,
the more certain is this rule.            With elements which are near
each other (Sn and Pb, Ag and Hg), the reverse of the rule may
be the case. With metals of almost equal specific gravity (Ni and
Co, Cd and Cu), the mutual replacement is determined with diffi
culty. Copper and lead form a surprising exception: although
copper is specifically lighter than lead, yet lead, as is well known,
easily displaces copper; but copper scarcely displaces lead. Hg
and Ag are scarcely to be considered exceptions: mercury dis
places silver; but, as Odling found, silver can also displace        -
mercury; and, moreover, mercury is liquid.
   Besides the metals, the rule indicated is confirmed by the
cases of Cl, Br, and I, and, as far as can be concluded from a
few experiments, in the cases of O, S, Se, and Te.
   The author discusses the influence of the specific gravity of
the elements on their reactions, and thereby reduces chemical
affinity to purely mechanical principles.
   In chemical decompositions the relative stability of different
compounds plays an essential part.                 The author comes to the
conclusion that, of the compounds of an element, those are most
stable in which the equivalents of the elements united are as nearly
equal as possible.     Of the silver compounds, for instance,
       AgO (108:8–13.5:1),                 AgCl (108:35-5–3: 1),
             AgI (108: 127=1           :  1)),

 iodide of silver is the most stable, because here the ratio of the
 equivalents is nearest unity. Hence it is that AgO so readily
 decomposes with KI, and in like manner AgCl with KBr and
 KI. But potash decomposes AgI and AgBr only with diffi
 culty, but AgCl much more easily. The elements have there
fore a tendency to form compounds with equal equivalents; and
it is not surprising that the author could liberate barium from
BaO, but not from BaCl by aluminium.
    This, however, forms no exception to the influence of the
specific gravity of the elements upon the course of the reaction.
According to Wöhler, aluminium can readily liberate Ag from
AgI, and the author succeeded in doing the same with manga
nese.    But at a very high temperature aluminium and, especi
ally, magnesium will probably be set free from their respective
iodides by silver, as in fact Deville has set potassium free from
KI   by silver.

vapours at different pressures, by which other temperatures were
obtained. This mode of heating has two advantages over the
use of liquids in producing high temperatures: in the first place,
the temperatures are quite uniform, and may be retained for any
length of time; in the second, the interior of the exhausted
tube is visible, and that, too, in the case of strongly-coloured
vapours, such as that of sulphur, provided a flame is held behind
the tube.
   Red phosphorus, at temperatures of 307° and 324°, became
somewhat darker, without any other change; but when heated
in the vapour of chloride of mercury (358° C.), a few drops of
colourless phosphorus were found in the upper part of the tube,
the quantity of which did not increase, provided this tempera
ture was not exceeded.      When, however, the vapour of sulphur
or of sulphide of phosphorus was used, the quantity of colour
less phosphorus materially increased. While the glass tube is
heated, this quantity of colourless phosphorus fills the interior
of the exhausted tube as vapour; in a given space at a given
temperature, a definite quantity of vapour is formed from the
red phosphorus without the latter becoming liquid. When this
maximum of density and tension is attained, the rest of the
phosphorus remains unchanged.         On cooling, this vapour con
denses as colourless   phosphorus.               If

    The vaporization of red phosphorus is exceedingly slow as
 compared with that of a liquid body.                            -
    An exhausted glass tube containing red phosphorus was screwed
up in an iron one, the interstices being filled with magnesia pressed
 down. The tube was then heated in the flame of five Bunsen’s
burners, the temperature of which was gradually raised. In the
 cases in which the tubes held out, besides the drops of colourless
phosphorus, the red phosphorus was found to be merely sintered
together, and not melted. In this respect, as comparative expe
 riments showed, the deportment of phosphorus quite resembles
 that of arsenic: arsenic heated in a closed tube volatilized and
formed beautiful crystals without melting.
    Colourless phosphorus, when heated in an hermetically sealed
vessel (an iron tube can be used), is changed into red phosphorus
by being heated for a short time to a temperature of 300° C.
    An attempt was made to determine directly the heat which
 becomes free when colourless changes into red phosphorus, by
placing a thermometer in some phosphorus contained in a flask
which was heated in an air-bath.       When the temperature of the
 bath was    295°, the thermometer in the phosphorus marked
282°; at this point the temperature of the latter began rapidly
to rise and soon attained 370°C.; the cork in which the thermo
meter was placed was not tight at this temperature, and phospho
rus-vapours escaped and caused the experiment to be stopped.
    Schrötter found the tension of colourless phosphorus to be
760 millims. at 290°; comparing this with that of red, which
at 358° is only 31 millims, and considering that above 300°
liquid colourless phosphorus cannot exist, it would appear pos
sible to drive phosphorus from a position of lower temperature
to one of higher. An exhausted tube containing ordinary phos
phorus was exposed at one end to the temperature 255°, and at
the other to that of 358°C.; the hotter part remained, however,
quite empty; no red phosphorus was deposited there. It follows
from this thatcolourless phosphorus-vapour can retaina higherten
sion and density than that which is formed from red phosphorus.
A number of special experiments show that when colourless phos
phorus was used instead of red, far higher densities and ten
sions were obtained for the same temperatures.
    Colourless phosphorus in the exhausted tubes, when the tem
 perature is raised, has probably passed partially into the vaporous
 state. The part which has remained liquid passes into the state of
red phosphorus, and, by
                            of its
                               disengagement    of heat, materially  in
 creases the temperature       the surrounding medium, and thus
 givesa  higher density and tension      to the vapour.   Experiment
 showed that the tension and density which the vapours          at first
obtain are not stable and continually diminish, while red phos

phorus is deposited. Only after about two hours' heating is a
 stable maximum obtained; it very slowly increases with the
 temperature, and is always considerably greater than that dis
 engaged at the same temperature from red phosphorus.
    A large quantity of colourless phosphorus was heated in hy
 drogen gas under various pressures, which increased to four at
 mospheres.      When heated over free flame it always boiled rapidly;
 the formation of vapour was always more rapid than the change
into red phosphorus.
    From Hittorf's experiments it follows that the vapour of red
 phosphorus may be cooled from 447° to 358° (that                       through                is,
 90°) without changing                         its

 M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., Superintendent of the Kew Observatory.
    Some time since, in connexion with a research on the fusing
point of mercury, several observations were made at Kew of the
specific gravity of this fluid.
    A specific-gravity bottle was used for this purpose, and it was
 washed, in the first place with sulphuric acid, secondly with dis
tilled water, and thirdly with alcohol; when this was done it was
found to contain mercury without any air-specks or any diminution
of that metallic lustre which pure mercury exhibits when in contact
with a vessel of clean glass. Three different specimens of pure mer
 cury were used, and were separately weighed in the specific-gravity
bottle at 62°Fahr. The following results were obtained:—

 the mean of these will be 13591'66 grs.
   It was found that the specific-gravity bottle had an internal volume
equal very nearly to 4 cubic inches; and assuming that a cubic inch
of air weighs 0.31 gr., then the air displaced by the liquid filling the
bottle would weigh 1:24 gr.
   In like manner the air displaced by the Kew standard weights
(sp. gr. 8:2) would have the volume of 6-6 cubic inches, and would
weigh 2:04 grs.
   From these premises we find that the real weight of the mercury in
vacuo would have been 13590'86 grs.
   Again, the amount of water which the same bottle held at 62°F.
weighed in air 1000-53 grs.
   Here the air displaced by the bottle                              is,

   The following communications were read:—
   1. “On the mode of formation of certain Lake-basins in New
Zealand.”    By W. T. Locke Travers, Esq.
  The author's observations had been chiefly directed to the neigh
bourhood of the Spencer Mountains, which occupy the centre of the
area constituting the provinces of Nelson and Marlborough, in the
Middle Island, and in this paper he more particularly described
Lake Arthur, Lake Howick, and Lake Tennyson, with the rivers
flowing out of them.       After describing the nature and mode of
occurrence of certain Postpliocene boulder-beds          overlying older
Tertiary deposits in the vicinity of Lake Arthur, Mr. Travers showed
that that lake owes       existence    its

                                  in          for several miles down the
valley.    Similar facts were then described      having been observed             as
                         Tennyson;   and attention was specially drawn
to at
    Lakes Howick and
    their great depth, Lake Howick being 1000 feet deep rather less
than halfway up, and the others also attaining          depth     several                a               of

      conclusion Mr. Travers stated that, although
        In                                                  had confined                       he

    3.       “On       the Glacial Phenomena                        of   Caithness.”          By   T.    F.   Jamie
son, Esq.,             F.G.S.
    The glacial drift              of       Caithness              occurs     in   sheets filling        up   the low

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                  319
troughs and winding hollows which form the beds of the streams,
the rocks on the higher ground being either bare or hidden by a
growth of peat and heather.          It thins out at altitudes of from 100
to 150  feet, and its thickness is therefore very variable, though it
seldom much exceeds 100 feet.           Mr. Jamieson first described the
distribution of the drift-beds over the area in question, their texture
and colour at the different localities where they occur, and the
nature and appearance of the stones and boulders found in them;
he then noticed the broken state of the shells, the most common
species being Cyprina Islandica, Astarte borealis, A. elliptica, Tellina
calcarea, T. Balthica, and Turritella ungulina.          The direction of the
glacial markings on the rocks was shown to be pretty uniformly
from N.W. to S.E. (true); so that it must have been produced by a
movement of ice proceeding from an external region to the N.W.,
and not by glacier-action proceeding from the interior of the country,
as is the case in the midland region of Scotland.           The glacial drift
of Caithness and the old boulder-clay of the middle of Scotland
resemble one another in their physical arrangement, but differ in the
prevalence of marine organisms in the former. The absence of tran
quilly deposited glacial-marine beds, of moraines, and of gravel
hillocks, and the deficiency of valley-gravel in Caithness, are also
points in which the glacial series of that area differs from that of
Central Scotland; and Mr. Jamieson inferred that, of the two series,
the Caithness drift was the more recent.           In conclusion the author
described the deposits of the Postglacial period in Caithness, and
showed that they did not differ materially from        -  those occurring in
 the rest of Scotland.

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF GASES UNDER FEEBLE PRESSURES.
                               BY A. MORREN.
          author alludes to the experiments which M. A. de la Rive
 THE  made on the conductivity of nitrogen and hydrogen; and he pub
lishes the results at which he himself has arrived either with these
gases or with others.
   The author enters into details on the subject of the methods which
he used in his experiments.        It is sufficient to mention that, in rare
fying the gases, he used a mercury aspirator provided with two ma
nometers, one a mercurial one, the other containing sulphuric acid,
 so that the pressure on the gas could easily be determined to one
tenth of a millimetre of mercury.
   The electricity was furnished by a Ruhmkorff's coil put in action
by four Bunsen's elements; and the intensity of the current was mea
sured by a galvanometer formed of copper wire, 25 metres in length
and one-tenth of a millimetre in diameter. The gas is slowly rarefied,
so as to catch the moment of the first deflection; and at each instant
the elastic force of the gas, and the corresponding deflection of the
galvanometer, were accurately noted. To compare with greater cer
tainty the results obtained with various gases, the author had to

construct and frequently verify the Table of the ratios of the forces
to the galvanometric deflections.
   M. Morren has succeeded thus in arranging a comparative Table
of the electrical conductivity of some gases, which contains for
each gas the pressure, the deflection of the galvanometer, and the
force of the current corresponding to this deflection. Up to 36° of
deflection the forces are represented by the same numbers as the de
flections; but from 36° they increase far more rapidly than the
deflections.
  Thus, for a deflection of 66°-2 (the maximum deflection obtained
with hydrogen under a pressure of 2 millims.), the corresponding
force is 174, and so on.
   One of the most singular characters which rarefied gases present
is the black non-luminous band found near the negative electrode.
Its length frequently varies under circumstances which apparently
are quite identical; yet the author was able to determine the follow
ing lengths in various gases at pressures between 1 millim. and 0:5
millim :—                                                      millims.

  The colour of the jet varies with the nature of the glass of the tube
in which the gas is enclosed, which exercises great influence on the
colour which the different gases present.    The aureole which sur
rounds the negative electrode varies least, and furnished a ready
means of ascertaining the greater or less stability of some gases, par
ticularly of the compound gases.
   One fact noted by M. Morren, which appears curious enough, is
that oxygen, when pure, and the vapour of mercury give no stratifi
cations.
   It follows from the numbers in the Tables given by M. Morren,
that conductivity commences for each gas at very different moments
as regards pressure. Thus the current begins to pass, approximately,

             from the same Table, that for each gas there is a certain
pressure at which the electric conductivity is at  maximum.      Thusits

   I hope you can afford me space in your forthcoming Number to
announce and correct a serious blunder in my paper on “Sea-levels.”
   Starting, as I did, I should have treated the excess of matter in
the nucleus, equally with the ice-cap, as extraneous to the homoge
neous spheroid of which I was determining the form only.

my equation ; and         value,     its

 such size as to make the resultant of the resisting pressures pass
 otherwise than infinitesimally near the centre of gravity of the whole
 body.     Professor Challis in particular finds this non-resistance of the
 aether to the orbital motions of the planets a problem requiring a
 special solution (Phil. Mag., May 1859).

 resistance being the real and only cause of the earth's axial rota

 ventured to remark that “In the actual case of the planets, their
 masses and velocities of rotation are such that the solar medium can
 be of course conceived, not as causing, but only as tending slightly
 to accelerate their rotations.” Were it the cause of such rotations,
 there would be such acceleration as, in the case of the earth at least,

               1860 I publishedt a method by means of which
IN Ithehadyear
           succeeded in constructing exact resistance-standards.
I thenproposed to accept, as unit of conducting-power, that                                 of
mercury at 0°C., and as unit of resistance that of a prism                                  of
mercury one metre long and one square millimetre section,                                   or

     The grounds upon which                         I   supported my proposition       were
briefly    as    follows:–

be adopted for general resistance measurements—although it is
 obviously of the last importance to determine, as exactly as pos

328                  M. W. Siemens    on the Question   of
in which         I
            can scarcely suppose him, however, to be serious: it
is that we have never found a gold chain become brittle.
   It may, however, be conceded that changes in the resistances
of normal standards and their copies may be so small as to be
without practical importance in our present experiments.     But
the normal measures of the B. A. are destined to serve in future
times, when probably an infinite number of higher claims to
exactness in a measure will be set up than we can pretend to.
   On this ground it is certainly significant that the Committee
should have made ten normal measures instead of a single one,
even supposing them to agree with each other to within 0.03
per cent., as asserted.
   With regard to the agreement between the B. A. unit and
107   junits,
      second          even allowing  that it is within 0.1 per cent.,
as stated in the Report of 1864, still it is too small to enable
the values to be given out as equivalents; and if a coefficient
must be used, I do not see that it matters in the least whether
it differs a little more or a little less from unity.
   Besides, it is by no means satisfactorily proved that this pro
fessed accordance of the B.A. and the 107      #.  units really exists.
A glance at the Table of results given in the Report of 1864
(p.350) will suffice to show, between the values of the negative and
positive observations, combined into pairs, differences amounting
to 9 per cent.      These differences are partly accounted for by the
torsion of the fibre, which entered into the results, adding or
subtracting from the observed values, according as the helix of
the apparatus was rotated right- or left-handed.        But the mean
values of these    pairs of observations differ still as much as 1:4
per cent.      By what train of reasoning the Subcommittee holds
itself justified, in the face of such differences between even the
means of their single observations, in concluding upon a pro
bable error of only 0.1 per cent., I am totally unable to ima
gine.    Whatever method is taken to calculate the mean values
of the given numbers, if some of the extreme measurements or
some of the mean values be left out, very much greater differ
ences are indicated.
  In  my opinion, certainty lies only within the limits of those
numbers which are not liable to be regarded with mistrust as
being faulty and therefore entitled to be cast out.
   It
        in is,
         however, impossible, from the numbers given             the in
          question,    conclude upon                                      so

Subcommittee;    and  when   we   recollect  that  the observations
were made with the same apparatus, with the employment                    of
the same correction-coefficients, the probability considerably

much greater than it appears.            It is true that the determinations
of the constants       are,   for the most part, given as being exact
within    0-0001;     but we must conclude that this was only attained
in consequence of extraordinary manipulation and carefully se
lected methods of measurement.               The methods used are, how
ever, not entirely free from sources of possible error.            It is well
known, for example, that it is absolutely impossible to wind a
coil of silk-covered wire to an approximately round or solid coil
without stretching          it.The amount       this stretching varies, with
                                                          of
the thickness and the tension               the wire (in winding), between
                                                    of
1   and    6 per cent.      It would therefore        next     impossible
                                                                      be        to                              to
conclude, with anything like certainty, within              per cent., upon    ;
the real length          of the coiled wire.       The real length        the                       of
coiled wire, however,            given                                                       In

                                 is        311'2356 metres.         addition
to   this,  it   quite impossible
                 is                       wind such coil perfectly round   a
 and concentric with covered wire. The circumference, the mean
 radius, the thickness           the coil, &c., can therefore only      given                      be
 approximately.        But        in of
                                  the Reports the numbers representing
 these values are given                   to

British Association, has undoubtedly been made with the greatest
possible exactness.                    I
                         am, on the contrary, certain that science
has materially  profited by a most serviceable work.
           I
   But think that the Committee, on convincing itself that
Weber's absolute unit even was not adapted for a normal mea
sure, would have done better not to have set up another arbitrary
unit, but to have had the mercury unit, as defined by me, re
produced with               all
                      possible care, with the great talent and the
perfect arrangements        their command, and
                                           at          have distributed                   to
copies     of   it.
                  This unit       already   very  generally

this procedure the Committee would have conformed with Kirch

                                       in
coincided, and with which the Committee,                first Report, de             in   its

   There       is   no

an accuracy quite equal   present requirements—that        say,

     Dr. Matthiessen concentrates     argument          his
                                                   the two theses—               in
     1st. That          no
                  true mercury unit has been issued.
     2ndly.    That the units issued from time                              to       time have not the
same resistance.
.    He endeavours     justify both these assertions
                                  to                    the fact that,                 by
in   the determinations    the unit,    of
                                      made use     the wrong

gravity     of   mercury;      that two sets                     of
                                                  resistance-coils shown                                        in
the London            Exhibition      1862 differed 1.2 per cent. between
                                             of
themselves     ;      that    the first determination
                              in                           the mercury unit     of
differences        of  1.6 per cent. appeared between the different tubes;
and that       his    determination      the unit differs 0.8 per cent. from
                                                  of
Inline.
     In
      supporting his first assertion, Dr. Matthiessen loses sight
of the fact that the measure proposed          consists     defini    by    me                   of   a
tion, and     therefore absolute. That the resistance-coils and
               is

                                  I                the contrary,                 on                            I
have repeatedly expressed the wish that, sooner      later, experi                     or
enced  physicists would take the trouble    reproduce  the measure    to
according        to
               the definition with the best means        command.                           at
Dr. Matthiessen would have been justified            his first assertion        in
if my definition had been doubtful,                              or
                                               the method laid down   if
had been untrustworthy; but                            he
                                        has proved neither.          con                              I

0.1 per cent.                   -
   From the first determination only few standards and sets   a                                               of
resistance-coils were made, originally for our own use. Those
sets  of coils which have been made subsequently, for our own use
or for  sale,  have been, without exception, adjusted according                                               to
the second determination         the unit.   Lastly, from the mean
                                                 of
values of the third determination        have had about   I   hundred                            a

  Dr. Matthiessen must be well aware of the fact that points of
contact between solid metals have always a changing resistance;
that therefore the contact-plugs of a set of resistance-coils through
which, either wholly or in part, the current has to pass must
give rise to a want of exactness.   He will himself have frequently
found and be fully able to appreciate the great difficulties in the
way of summing up 5000 units for the first time in this way
without considerable error creeping                             in.
    The set of resistance-coils which Dr. Matthiessen calls
“Siemens, London,” was one                          of
                                           the first made for private use                                      in

                                                                    of

                                                  the weight system. The

                                          of
 an  improved system.
    Dr. Matthiessen asserts, further, that the sets                coils adjusted     of
 by this improved system differ 0.5 per cent. from the standards                                               of
 1864.     He concludes this from the measurements                          copper          of   a
 wire which Mr. Fleeming Jenkin, during the Exhibition                       1862,                   of
compared with the sets             coils. of What     temperature      the  copper
 wire had         the two measurements, made with

 discrepancy

334                  M. W. Siemens              on the Question               of
to which this might be attributed, viz. variations of temperature
of the copper wire with which the tubes were compared, to 3°C.,
and of the tubes themselves to 2°C. Besides this, Sabine has
pointed out in his paper that these differences were ascribable
principally to errors in the measuring-apparatus, being quantita
tively plus or minus according as the balance-wire was bisected on
one side or the other of the middle point. And even were the
differences apparent in the first determination not to be satis
factorily explained, they would nevertheless say nothing against
the system, because the tubes chosen were not so cylindrical as
they might have been—the object of this determination not being
so much to establish normal standards, as to prove that the pro
posed method was capable of doing so.        For practical purposes,
at that date, an exactness of 0.5 per cent. was considered amply
sufficient; and indeed Dr. Matthiessen was himself contented
with determinations of the conducting-powers of the metals.
which differed many per cent.
    The little standards which             I
                                  have distributed were      adjusted                    all
to  within 0.05 per cent.             of
                               the mean value        the third repro     of

                                                                it             be

ducible within the same limit of exactness.
I      do not think that Dr. Matthiessen should have compared
the results     ofhis determination with mine,                has departed,
                                                                         as    he
in  several material points, from the method which              laid down.         I
    The correction-formula for conicalness         employed        Dr. Mat           by
thiessen regards the tubes                 as
                                       series     different cylinders, and
                                                          of
not   as cones,      as   inmy formula.       The coefficient       however,           is,
very small, and would not account for the difference between
the determinations, although             would
                                            it                 be   in
                                                        the same direction.
A   more   important      deviation from the modus operandi which                                 I
followed,      is
               in  filling   the tubes           by
                                             dipping them into trough                        a
of   mercury, and lifting them out again                             by
                                                         pressing the ends
between two     fingers.       The soft skin     the  points
                                                          of     the fingers        of
would naturally              pressed into the openings, whereby the
weighed contents          of be
                              the tubes would          too small, and the
                                                                be
calculated resistance therefore too large.
  It   is also barely possible that Dr. Matthiessen has omitted
to  invert the tubes      in the bridge, and              to
                                                  take means       the read            of
ings  in each direction.
   At any rate, the difference 0.8 per cent. exists between his
determination        of the mercury unit and mine; and                   not           if    it
                                                                                             is

                                               the method      had pointed    I
out.    On this account           I   do
                                    not think that the result        his de               of

                   the Unit of Electrical Resistance.              335
terminations can be put forward as a proof of the incorrectness
of mine.
     Mr. Fleeming Jenkin, in his paper* “On the New Unit of
Electrical Resistance proposed and issued by the Committee,”
&c., brings forward no new features whatever, but turns the
conclusions and experiments of Dr. Matthiessen to account
in a still more extended way. The communication which he
makes, that four of my 1864 standards were compared with four
different copies of the B. A. unit by four different observers,
with four different measuring-apparatus, giving the values
1-0456, 1-0455, 1-0456, and 1.0457 respectively, is interesting.
     The mean value of these observations (1-0456), multiplied into
the coefficient of correction for the right specific gravity of
mercury, or
                      13:596
                              x 1-0456= 1-0486,
                      T3:557
is   therefore the value of the B. A. unit in mercury units, or
                 1 mercury unit=0.9536 B. A. units.
     In  the present uncertainty     of the true relation between the
values of the B.     A. unit and    107;        units, we can translate
 the value of a resistance given in mercury units into terms
of the 101° Weber’s unit, or 107         #.     units measure by sub
 tracting 5 per cent.
     The historical sketch of the order in which different pro
 positions for resistance-measures     have been made, and the pro
 gresses in the field of resistance-measurements, with which Mr.
 Fleeming Jenkin commences his paper, induce me to make a
 few observations in order to correct some errors and omissions
 of things which interest me personally.
      Complete sets of resistance-coils, from 1 to 100 units, each
 unit equal to the resistance of one geographical mile of copper
 wire of 1 line diameter, at a temperature of 20° C., have been,
  since 1848, made in the Berlin branch of my establishment,
  repeatedly described, and distributed far and wide.       Mr. Jenkin
  says that “ until about the year 1850 measurements of resist
 ance were confined, with few exceptions, to the laboratory; but
 about that time underground telegraphic wires were introduced,
 and were shortly followed by submarine cables, in the exami
 nation and manufacture of which the practical engineer soon
 found the benefit of a knowledge of electrical laws.”
     Mr. Jenkin ought surely to be aware that, as early as
 1847 and 1848, subterranean lines of considerable lengths were

           L. On      the Aqueous Lines   of the Solar Spectrum.
                            By Josiah P. CookE, Jun.*
     CAREFUL       examination of the solar spectrum, continued
       during several months with the spectroscope described in
a recent article in this Journalit has led me to the conclusion
that a very large number of the more faint dark lines of the solar
spectrum, hitherto known simply as air-lines, are due solely to
the aqueous vapour of our air, and hence that the absorption of
the luminous solar rays by the atmosphere is chiefly at least
owing to the aqueous vapour which it contains.
  The appearance of the Fraunhofer's   line D, seen under pre
cisely the same conditions, but with increasing quantities of
aqueous vapour in the atmosphere, is shown in figs. 1, 2, 3, and
4. The D line is selected because, being a favourite test-object
for the spectroscope,             its
                        general appearance     well known                  is                        to   all
observers.     But even more marked changes than those here
illustrated have been noticed        others, but chiefly
                                                 in          contiguous               in
portions     of
              the solar spectrum.
    These changes attracted my attention from my earliest obser
vations with the spectroscope; but with my first instrument and
the bisulphide-of-carbon prisms then employed,              was almost               it
impossible       eliminate the effects which might                               be              by
              in to                                       caused     the
variations      the condition     the instrumentof itself;  and    these                        as
                       very great,
                            be         was possible that they might

were known                                            it
account for         the variations observed.     With the improved
instrument, however, just referred                              to,
                                               absolute constancy                                          of
                                   of all
action is  obtained,  and    merely   instrumental variations avoided.
       peculiar condition    the atmosphere gave the first clue                                       as
                                                                                                           on to

D lines, there   was a faint but broad nebulous band, barely re
solvable into lines of still lower magnitude”. It is impossible to
represent this band accurately with a woodcut; and the shaded
broad band marked k, on the right-hand side of fig. 4, only
serves to indicate              its

ture in the atmosphere was 376 grains per cubie foot. The ap
pearance of the D line at this time is shown in fig. 3.     Two of
the lines, m and S, and the nebulous band k, seen on the 17th of
November, were invisible, and, moreover, the group of three lines,
8, e, º, on the left-hand side of the figure, were only just within
the limits of visibility.
   On the 25th of December only two lines were visible within
the D lines, marked a and 8 in fig. 2, and the last of these was
quite faint. The temperature at the time of observation was
46°; the wet-bulb thermometer indicated 40°, and the amount
of moisture in the air was 2.42 grains per cubic foot. The sky
was clear, and the sun brilliant.     Lastly, on January 5, 1866,
one     of the                                    in our climate
                   clear cold days which are so common
during the winter, only the single line a was visible within the
D line, as is shown in fig. 1. At the time of observation (near
noon) the dry-bulb thermometer marked 10°, the wet-bulb 9°;
and hence the amount of moisture in the atmosphere was only
0.81 of a grain per cubic foot. The sun, however, was as bril
liant as in either of the previous cases. The D line also ap
peared as in fig. 1 on the 8th of January, 1866, when the ther
mometer at noon stood at 10° below zero Fahrenheit, and when -
the barometer attained the unusual height of 31 inches.
   The above figures have been drawn so as to show, as nearly
as possible, the relative intensity of the different lines under dif
ferent atmospheric conditions.      As no accurate means of making
the comparison are yet known, I was obliged to depend upon
my eye alone; and small differences at different times of obser
vation may easily have escaped my notice.             Indeed      should                I
have been liable to great error were it not for the fact that one
of the lines within the D lines, marked a in           the figures, does    all
not vary        intensity, and served                      as

340                     Mr.      J.   P. Cooke on the Aqueous Lines
and a series of comparisons made under the same conditions, at
different heights, would give data for determining the law ac
cording to which the amount of vapour decreases with the eleva
tion above the sea-level.
   All the aqueous lines change in intensity like the line 8.
They first appear very faintly when the amount of vapour in the
air reaches a definite point, varying for the different lines, and
gradually gain in intensity as the amount of vapour increases.
Thus the group of three lines, 8, e, , do not appear in fig. 2, are
barely visible in fig. 3, but become very marked in fig. 4*.
The lines m and 8 and the nebulous band k do not appear until
the air is very moist, and even when it contains 6:57 grains of
vapour per cubic foot they are still very faint.  Under still more
unusual   atmospheric  conditions   they will  undoubtedly become
more intense, and we shall then probably be able to completely
resolve the nebulous band and count the lines of which it
consists.
       It is
         hardly necessary to repeat that the examples here given
are selected from a large number of observations.              During the
cold dry weather of winter the appearance of the D line is uni
formly as shown in fig. 1, the line & only occasionally appear
ing when the atmosphere becomes more moist. During the
warm weather of summer, when the absolute amount of mois
ture in the air is in almost                      all
                                    cases greater than          winter, the             in

rays, when most brilliant at noon, traverse a greater extent of
air, but, moreover, the atmosphere at this time is usually clearer,
and the reflected beam of light which enters the spectroscope
is at times even more brilliant than when the sun attains a
higher elevation, and the light is reflected
                                    -        under less favourable
conditions.

flint-glass prisms.    These sulphide-of-carbon      prisms are very
variable in their action; but under the best conditions they
might show the D line as in fig. 3, when with the flint-glass
prisms it would appear as in fig. 2.
   The facts stated in this paper fully account for the discrepan
cies in the representations which different observers have given
of the D line. Some time since Mr. Gassiot of London gave in
the ‘Chemical News’ a representation of the D line as seen with
his instrument, showing several lines in addition to those seen
by myself and other observers.     On visiting the Kew Observa
tory in the summer of 1864, I was surprised to find that this
instrument was less powerful than the one I was then using, and
I   also learned that these lines were only seen on a single occa
sion. The moist climate of England is the evident explanation
of the additional lines.
     As I stated at the beginning of this paper, the D line has been
 selected simply to illustrate a general truth.       The development
 of  aqueous   lines in contiguous   portions of the spectrum is even
 more marked than in the       exceedingly limited portion here repre
 sented.     Indeed, as has been already intimated, the number of
 these lines seen in the yellow region of the spectrum, on the
 17th of November, was at least ten times as great as that of the
 true solar lines. That part of the yellow of the spectrum which
 lies on the more refrangible side of the D line, and in which,
 during dry weather, only a comparatively few lines can be dis
 tinguished, was then as thickly crowded with lines as the blue
 or the violet; but the lines were of course far less intense.
     Professor Tyndall of London has shown, by a remarkable
 series of experiments with the thermo-multiplier, not only that
 aqueous vapour powerfully absorbs the obscure thermal rays,
 but also that the elementary gases of the atmosphere exert little
 or no action upon them.     I   have endeavoured to establish in this
 paper, from direct observations with the spectroscope, a similar
 truth in regard to the luminous rays. It has been estimated by
 Pouillet and others, that about one-third of the solar rays inter
 cepted by the earth are absorbed in passing through the atmo
 sphere; and it now appears that aqueous vapour is the most im
 portant, if not the chief, agent in producing this result.         It is
 impossible, however, from any data we yet possess, to determine
 how great a power of absorption is exerted by the oxygen and
 nitrogen gases which constitute the great mass of our atmo
 sphere.     I have shown that a very great many, and I have no
 doubt that almost    all the lines hitherto distinguished    as
                                                               air-lines
 are simply aqueous lines; but     it   isvery difficult to distinguish
 atmospheric lines from the true solar lines, and our knowledge         of
 the firstis   as   yet very incomplete.     It still remains      to
                                                                   make

 careful comparisons throughout the whole extent of the spectrum,
before we can determine absolutely the relative absorbing power
of the different constituents of our atmosphere.
   One other inference from the facts here developed is worthy
of notice before closing this paper. It has been for some time
suspected that the blue colour of the sky was in some way con
nected with the vapour in the atmosphere; and it is a fact of com
mon observation that this colour is more intense during the moist
weather of summer than during the dryer weather of winter.
The distribution of the aqueous lines through the solar spectrum
not only confirms the opinion previously entertained, but also
points to the cause of the colour.       So far as my observations
have extended, the aqueous lines are almost wholly, if not com
pletely, confined to the more refrangible portions of the spec
trum.     Here they are found in vast numbers, and            am not
                                                                 If,
                                                                                     I
positive that they exist anywhere else.           then, the aqueous
vapour absorbs most powerfully the yellow and red rays             the                   of

it was inferred, the motion being wholly vibratory, that the con

   Secondly, reasons were given for concluding that, although the
series for    and
                w     were derived from equations that are not
                          a
linear, the velocities and condensations expressed        different                       by
sets  ofsuch series may coexist.   As, however,    appeared from                   it
further consideration that the reasons alleged were not valid                                              to

from a fixed centre, because the motion in that case is rectilinear,

plicable, the following process of solution has been adopted for
the case of undulations incident on a fived sphere.      As in this
 case a relation exists between U and W which       depends   on the
mutual action of the parts of the fluid, and is on that account to
 be ascertained by integration, the quantities in brackets in the
 equation (8) are equated to zero, and from the two resulting

   Since, as has been already remarked, the differential equations
to this order of approximation are the same whether the origin
of the polar coordinates be fixed or moving, the preceding results
may be made applicable to the case of a small sphere oscillating
in the fluid at rest. In fact, if the vibrations of the fluid be
counteracted by impressing equal and opposite vibrations, and if
the same vibrations be impressed on the sphere, we pass from
the problem above considered to that of the oscillating sphere.
But in consequence of these impressed velocities W is evidently
diminished by m'sin q(alt+co) sin 6, and a is diminished by the
condensation due to the state of vibration of the incident fluid—
                        do’,

                        a'dt
 the remaining values of a and W are precisely those which are ob
 tained by the usual mode of solving the problem of the disturb
 ance of the fluid by the sphere.        Now it is to be observed that
 in the case of each    problem   the velocities and pressures are the
 same, as far as regards approximations of the first degree, whether
the fluid be considered very elastic or wholly incompressible.
But if the fluid be incompressible,         action    the sphere    its
                                                                     rest           on                    at

              acted upon by the Undulations                             of an Elastic Fluid.                  357
 versely, if the cubical portion of fluid be stationary and the sphere
 oscillate, the fluid which passes the plane through the sphere's
 centre must be just as much as the sphere displaces; and this,
 again, results from the usual analytical treatment of this pro
 blem.     But from these considerations it necessarily follows that
 the condition of the rigid boundary is involved in that mode of
 treatment.      By reasoning contained in this and previous com
 munications,            I
                   have pointed out that this condition is implicitly
 introduced when uda-H way+wdz is assumed to be an exact differ
 ential for this instance of arbitrary disturbance.     The two pro
 blems here considered admit of that assumption, and are on that
account correlative; but the problem of the sphere oscillating in
unlimited fluid is distinct from these, not being a case for which
uda + vay-Fwdz is integrable without a factor, and requiring on
that account particular treatment, which I have already frequently                                                   .

object of this inquiry is to determine the motion of a sphere free
to obey the impulses of the fluid. To make the preceding inves
tigation applicable to the solution of this problem,    adopt the                             I
principle that the action of the undulations on the sphere in
motion is due to the relative motion of the fluid and sphere.

LII.      On the Galvanometer Resistance to be employed in testing

IT with
   has been proved elsewhere that, in measuring resistances
        Wheatstone's diagram, the highest degree of sensi
tiveness is attained when the four branch resistances                                 are   equal;
but no investigation exists at present, to my knowledge, for                                    de
termining the equally important question,
  Which relative galvanometer resistance raises the magnetic mo
ment of the galvanometer to a maximum when the other branches
of the     diagram   are given.
     It        further proved that, in order to raise the magnetic

moment of the galvanometer in simple circuit to a maximum,
the resistance of the galvanometer must be equal to the external
resistance.
    For analogous         it may be inferred that there must be
                        reasons,
a similar law in  measuring  resistances with Wheatstone's dia
gram; and the only question        Which        is,

                      that the readers of the present communication
PRESUMING
         are familiar with my papers on Newton’s Rule in the
 Magazines for August and October last, I now proceed to sup
ply what appears to be necessary in order to complete the de
monstration of that rule. And first           observe that whenever I
Newton’s condition of imaginary roots holds for any triad of
terms in a primitive equation, it necessarily holds also in every
equation derived from it into which the same triad of coefficients
enters; and consequently it holds for every reciprocal of these
derived equations.
    This is a circumstance peculiar to the class of imaginaries
thus indicated; and from which it follows that the cubics derived
from the reciprocal equations will retain among them just as
many several conditions of imaginary roots as are presented to
us in the primitive equation. This truth is sufficiently esta
blished by the series of cubics, in a general form, deduced from
the equally general reciprocal equations.
    Taking these cubics in order, from the first to the last, we see
that the entrance of an imaginary pair into an advanced cubic
may be necessitated by, and therefore dependent on, the entrance
of an imaginary pair into the preceding cubic just passed over;
and that this again may necessitate the entrance of a pair into the
next succeeding cubic, and so on.
    Suppose, however, that these dependencies cease, and that we
at  length  arrive at a cubic the imaginary pair in which is unde
rived from, and independent                         of,
                                      preceding pairs. Would such
an occurrence warrant the inference that there must be             least                         at
two   pairs   ofimaginary   roots   the primitive

when the eccentricity was 0.0569, and the other ranging from
950,000      750,000 years before the present epoch, with three
                 of to
maxima       eccentricity, viz. 0-0517, 0.0747, and 0.0575.        The
following are Mr. Croll's words:—
  “We have     already stated        our opinion that the glacial epoch
                                                    it     as
of the geologist was the period beginning about 240,000 years
ago and extending down till about 80,000 years ago (‘Reader,’
October 14, December         and 9). The time 2       the greatest cold                  of

 At that time the eccentricity was exactly equal           what     was                         to              it
210,000 years ago.        Going back 50,000 years further, we find
the eccentricity          only 0:0132.

ther back,   viz. 850,000  years  ago, the eccentricity almost reached
 its
   superior limit.         quite possible that this, and not 200,000
                                     It   is
years ago, may have been the period            the boulder-clay.   Pro       of

but at the period 950,000 years ago it reached the high value
of 0-0517.    Here we have three glacial epochs following each
other in close succession—or rather, we should say, one long
glacial epoch of about 250,000 years broken up by two mild
periods 100,000 years apart.”
   The foregoing conclusions are irreconcileable with the opinion
commonly held by astronomers, that the quantity of heat received
from the sun annually increases with the increase of the eccen
tricity; so that the periods selected as glacial epochs by Mr.
Croll are probably nearer the times of maximum heat, so far as
this is dependent on the eccentricity of the orbit.
   The following demonstration of the law, “That the quantity
of heat received per annum from the sun varies inversely as the
minor azis of the orbit,” may be of use to some of your junior
readers:—

 Mr. Jenkin found difference       a   1.2 per cent.between the values

                                  informed me that our formula was
quite       correct            as
                         that used                       by
                                        Dr. Siemens (both being only
approximate formulae).

                         p.

           364) 0.07 per cent.       Had the soft skin       the points                    of

  the weighings is 0.01.1 per cent. ; with the second, 0.007 per
 cent.; and with the third, 0.07 per cent.
.    (3) Dr. Siemens says that we ought to have inverted the tubes
 in the bridge, and taken the readings in both directions. We
  did not do this, but we did what amounted to the same; we took
  the zero-point of the scale immediately after each series of read
  ings.    It must be remembered that our bridge was so arranged
  that a millimetre movement of block corresponds to a change in
  the ratio of the resistances of about 0.01 per cent, whereas in
  Dr. Siemens’s bridge it corresponds to 0.4 per cent. ; also that
  we used as bridge-wire a platinum-iridium alloy (2 millims. dia
  meter), which on heating varies in conducting-power much less
 than platinum, of which Dr. Siemens's bridge-wire (0.16 millim.
 diameter) was made.
     One point which neither Dr. Siemens nor Mr. Sabine mention
 in their papers               is,
                       whether their weights and metre-scales were
 normally accurate;        mean whether they took the precaution

 ascertain,     we did with ours, that their gramme and metre were

My focal cubic is the locus of one set of foci of a system of
comics whose axes are parallel, which pass therefore through
four points lying in a circle. The axis in which the foci are
taken, and which is parallel to the real asymptote, in general
meets the focal curve in two points.       Whenever these points
come together, this parallel to the asymptote becomes a tan
gent; and the foci do come together for the circle itself and for
the three pairs of lines which can be drawn through the four                                                                       .

the centre of the circle and through the intersections of the three
pairs of lines just spoken     but   each

constituting a remarkable theorem concerning seven points (four
quite arbitrary) in a plane. If (as seems probable) the case
supposed is what actually obtains, a geometrical rule must
exist for determining the proper combination of signs to be em
ployed in the above determinant; and then l; m; n ; p will be
proportional to the first minors of the three first lines of the
matrix above written f.
   The above theory, very hastily sketched out under the pressure
of other occupations, will serve at all events to manifest in how
very imperfect and incohate a form the theory of foci at present
exists, and may serve to raise the question whether there is not
a family of curves distinguishable by the possession of syzygetic
foci, and which may be termed syzygetic or norm curves (in

   * In an evil hour for the cause of sound nomenclature, and by an over
hasty generalization, a property of foci properly so called was substituted
for their true definition as centres of linear relationship.          The temp
tation was    great, it must be allowed;  for the new definition    gave  a means
of describing each focus per se without reference to the associated points:
it calls to mind the analogous attempted definition of man as a featherless
biped, and is open to the like kind of objections.          The mischief being
done, and under cover of the authority of names so great that to root it

pile devised by Melloni for the examination of this and kindred
questions. Through the kindness of my friend Mr. Gassiot, a
very beautiful instrument of this kind, constructed by Ruhm
korff, has remained in my possession for several years, and been
frequently employed in my researches.       It consists of a double
metallic  screen, with a rectangular aperture in the centre, a sin
gle row of thermo-electric elements 12 inch in length being
fixed to the screen behind the aperture.      Connected with the
latter are two moveable side pieces, which can be caused to ap
proach or recede so as to vary the width of the exposed face of
the pile from zero to       oth of an inch. The instrument is
mounted on a slider, which, by turning a handle, is moved along
a slot on a massive metal stand.     A spectrum of a width equal
to the  length of the thermo-electric pile being cast at the proper
elevation on the screen, by turning the handle of the slider the
vertical face of the pile can be caused to traverse the colours,
                                                                                      -
 and also the spaces right and left of them.
    To produce a steady spectrum of the electric light, I employed
 the regulator devised by M. Foucault and constructed by Du
 boscq, the constancy of which is admirable.           A complete rock
 salt train was constructed for me       by Mr.   Becker,   and arranged
 in the  following     manner:—In the front orifice of the camera
 which surrounds the electric lamp was placed a lens of trans
parent rock-salt, intended to reduce to parallelism the divergent
rays proceeding from the carbon-points.          The parallel beam was
permitted to pass through a narrow slit, in front of which was
placed another rock-salt lens, the position of this lens being so
arranged that a sharply-defined image% of the slit was obtained
at a distance beyond it equal to that at which the spectrum was
to be formed.        Immediately behind this lens was placed a pure
rock-salt    prism    (sometimes two of them).       The beam was thus
decomposed, a brilliant horizontal spectrum being cast upon the
screen which bore the thermo-electric pile.             By turning the
handle    already   referred       to,
                                  the face     of

     Here, as before stated, we begin in the blue, and pass first
  through the visible spectrum. Quitting this at the place marked
  “(extreme red),” we enter the invisible calorific spectrum and reach
* the position of maximum heat, from which, onwards, the ther
  mal power falls till it practically disappears.
     In other observations the pile was first brought up to the
  position of maximum heat, and moved thence to the extremity
  of the spectrum in one direction.      It was then brought back to
  the maximum, and moved to the extremity in the other direc
  tion.   There was generally a small difference between the two
  maxima, arising, no doubt, from some slight alteration of the
  electric light during the period which intervened between the
 two observations. The following Table contains the record of a
 series of such measurements.     As in the last case, the motion
 of the pile is measured by turns of the handle, and the values
 of the deflections are given with reference to a maximum of 100.

several, expresses,                      with a close approximation to accuracy, the
distribution of heat in the spectrum of the electric light from
fifty cells of Grove. The space A B C D represents the invisible,
while CD E represents the visible radiation. We here see the
gradual augmentation of thermal power, from the blue end of
the spectrum to the red. But in the region of dark rays beyond
the red the curve shoots suddenly upwards in a steep and massive
peak, which quite dwarfs by              magnitude the portion      its  the                                                       of

   The sun's rays before reaching the earth have              pass through                                      to

  Leaving the cell undisturbed, the transparent bisulphide of

The results, it is plain, refer solely to the iodine dissolved in the

THE
  “On the Forms of Graphitoidal Silicon and Graphitoidal                                            Boron.”

                                      Graphitoidal Silicon.
   It has been so confidently assumed that graphitoidal silicon is
an allotropic condition of silicon crystallized in octahedrons, that on
ascertaining by measurement of angles that some graphitoidal silicon
given me by Dr. Matthiessen was in simple and twin octahedrons, I
at once concluded that the substance had been wrongly named.
Later, however, I obtained from Dr. Percy a supply of graphitoidal
silicon of unquestionable authenticity.       Its lustre was that of the
crystals     I
             had previously examined.      It occurred in small scales,
having for the most part the appearance of crystals of the oblique
system.     On measurement, however, they proved to be octahe
drons in which two parallel faces were much larger than any of the
other faces, and two other parallel faces were either too small to be ob
served or were altogether wanting.         One of the scales had       the                               all
faces   of
         a twin octahedron.        appears, then, that there

                             form, for separating graphitoidal from octa

  The forms observed                            by     Sella, considered as belonging to the
oblique system, are:—

dal.    Sella, however, relying apparently upon the evidence afforded
by the lustre and colour of the scales, for he was unable to obtain
any measurements, expresses his conviction that they are not differ
ent from pure boron.      Some scales of this substance, for which, as well
as a supply of crystals of pure boron,    I am indebted to Dr. Matthies
sen, have faces on their edges, but so narrow that the reflected image
of the bright signal is diffracted into a line of considerable length, and
therefore difficult to bisect.    For this reason it is not possible to de
                                                                        -

    One of them, about 2 millims. wide and 0:01.4 millim. thick,
of the shape of half a hexagon divided by a line at right angles to
 two opposite sides, exhibited faces agreeing in position very fairly,
considering the unavoidable errors of observation, with two of the
faces k, two of the faces e, c, m, three of the faces b, two of the faces
r, q, three of the faces h, and four of the faces a. Another, smaller
and thinner, of the shape of a hexagon, had faces coinciding with
 two of the faces k, two of the faces e, c, m, f, v, and four of the faces
h. The agreement in position of so many of the faces with those of
pure boron appears to leave but little doubt of the identity of the
forms of the two substances.

    The following communications       were  read:—
    1. “On the Tertiary Mollusca of Jamaica.”          By R. J. Lechmere
 Guppy, Esq.
    In 1862 Mr. Lucas Barrett deposited in the British Museum a
collection of Miocene fossils from Jamaica; and the author having
 described the nature of the beds whence the fossils were obtained,
 remarked on the extended development of the Miocene formation in .
the Caribbean area. From his examination of the fossils, he was
able to confirm many of the conclusions arrived at by Mr. Carrick
Moore from his investigation of the San-Domingo fossils, and by
Dr. Duncan's and Prof. Rupert Jones's investigations of the Corals        -
and Foraminifera of the West-Indian Miocene deposits.
    The author considered that the Middle Tertiary beds of San
Domingo, Cuba, Cumana, and the Caroni series in Trinidad, toge
ther with the Miocene deposits of Jamaica, represent the upper or
later part of the West-Indian Miocene; while the chert formation
of Antigua, the Anguilla beds, and the beds exposed at San Fer
nando in Trinidad belong to the lower and older part of the same
formation.
    Reference was then made to the distinguishing features and cha
racteristic fossils of the beds exposed in the several localities named;
and in endeavouring to correlate the beds in the different islands,

400                              Geological Society.
the terms Upper and Lower Miocene were used merely as marking
what seems to be their relative antiquity. Out of sixty-one species
enumerated in this communication, thirty-four have been found to
be common to Jamaica and San Domingo, and fourteen to Jamaica
and Cumana.      Thirteen species are ascertained to be still living,
some of which have been found in the Miocene of Europe and other
localities. Several of the extinct species exhibit strong eastern
affinities; but there is also a resemblance between a part of the
fauna and that now existing in the West Indies; and a certain
number of the species are allied to European early and middle
Tertiary forms.    The fauna as a whole is more nearly related to
that of Bordeaux, Dax, and Malta than to that of the American
Miocene deposits.
     2.   “On Tertiary Echinoderms from                the   West Indies.”    By
R.  J. Lechmere Guppy, Esq.
   The Corals, Shells, and Foraminifera of the West-Indian Miocene
having been more or less completely described, the author now
brought under notice the Echinoderms belonging to the same fauna,
which have been found in Anguilla and Trinidad associated with
shells determined to be of Miocene age. The species sufficiently
well preserved for determination are nine in number, of which two are
found in the Maltese beds; three others, which are new, are closely
allied to species found in the same locality. Three out of the nine
are still living in the West-Indian seas, but these are rare in the
 fossil state.
  3. “On Tertiary Brachiopoda from Trinidad.”      By R.      Lech      J.
mere Guppy, Esq.
  The beds whence these Brachiopoda were derived have already
been mentioned in the previous papers; their organic remains
have led to the belief that they belong to a lower horizon in the
Miocene series than the beds of Jamaica, Cumana, and San Domingo.
The Brachiopoda, which consist of three species of Terebratula, can
hardly be considered to throw much new light upon the question,
as they seem to be suggestive of Cretaceous affinities.   As it had
been suggested that the fossils in question might be derived from
older beds, the reasons which have led the author to an opposite
opinion were stated; and it was remarked, in conclusion, that they
do not resemble those of Malta.
   4. “On the affinities of Platysomus and allied genera.” By John
Young, M.D., F.G.S.
   The author described in detail the anatomy of Platysomus par
vulus, Ag., and two new genera, Amphicentrum and Mesolepis,                    all
from the North Staffordshire Coal-field, and, after discussing their

of iron-wire gauze of 170 to 200 meshes to the square centimetre ;
this is heated, and by means of a cylindrical piece of wood of smaller
diameter than the tube, with a hemispherical end, the disk is pushed

bright-green rings appear at equal distances.               On closer inspec
tion, it is seen that from ring to ring a faint blue band stretches
above the red one in a wave-shaped form, corresponding to the up
wards and downwards flickering of the upper part of the flame. The
greatest breadth of the blue band is in the neighbourhood of the
green rings. The sharpness with which the latter appear in the
mirror, indicates that the intervals of time during which the flame
emits intense green light are small as compared with the duration
of an entire pulsation. The beautiful green light does not arise from
the copper of the brass tube ; for it appears even in a glass burner;
moreover spectral observation shows that the green of the hydro
carbon spectrum is here concerned.
    3. The tube, in the condition suitable for sounding the pipe, may
also be used for another experiment.          If a platinum wire bent rect
angularly be held vertically in the flame so that it is near the gauze,
the wire soon begins to be incandescent;           for the small flame is very
hot, and silver readily melts in                     it.

matic analysis of the light which comes to us from them, how
ever, is surrounded with no ordinary difficulties.  The light of
the bright stars, even when concentrated by an object-glass or
speculum, is found to become feeble when subjected to the large
amount of dispersion which is necessary to give certainty and
value to the comparison of the dark lines of the stellar spectra
with the bright lines of terrestrial matter.       Another difficulty,

                      Spectra       of some of the   Fiated Stars.                 407
brighter       stars could be seen. The remeasuring of those already
described    by  Fraunhofer and    Donati,   and even the determining
the positions of a few similar lines in other stars, however, would
have been of little value for our special object, which was to
ascertain, if possible, the constituent elements of the different
stars. We therefore devoted considerable time and attention to
the perfecting of an apparatus which should possess sufficient
dispersive and defining power to resolve such lines as D and b
of the solar spectrum. Such an instrument would bring out
 the finer lines of the spectra of the stars, if in this respect they
 resembled the sun. It was necessary for our purpose that the
 apparatus should further be adapted to give accurate measures
 of the lines which should be observed, and that it should also be
 so constructed as to permit the spectra of the chemical elements
 to be observed in the instrument simultaneously with the spectra
 of the stars. In addition to this, it was needful that these two
 spectra should occupy such a position, relatively to each other, as
 to enable the observer to determine with certainty the coincidence
 or non-coincidence of the bright lines of the elements with the
  dark lines in the light from the star.
     Before the end of the year 1862 we had succeeded in con
  structing an apparatus which fulfilled part of these conditions.
  With this some of the lines of the spectra of Aldebaran, & Orio
  nis, and Sirius were measured; and from these measures dia
  grams of these stars, in greater detail than had then been pub
  lished, were laid before the Royal Society in February 1863.
  After the note was sent to the Society, we became acquainted
  with some similar observations on several other stars by Ruther
  furd, in Silliman’s Journal for 1863%. About the same time
  figures of a few stellar spectra were also published by Secchit.
  In March 1863 the Astronomer Royal presented to the Royal
  Astronomical Society a diagram in which are shown the positions
                                                      -
  of a few lines in sixteen starsi.
      Since the date at which our note was sent to the Royal Society
  our apparatus has been much improved, and in                       its
                                                          present form

408              Mr. W. Huggins and Dr. W. A. Miller                         on the
vatory of Mr. Huggins at Upper Tulse Hill. The object-glass
is a very fine one, by Alvan Clark of Cambridge, Massachusetts;
the equatorial mounting is by Cooke of York; and the telescope
is carried very smoothly by a clock motion.
   As the linear spectrum of the point of light which a star forms
at the focus of the object-glass is too narrow for the observation
of the dark lines, it becomes necessary to spread out the image
of the star; and to prevent loss of light, it is of importance that
this enlargement should be in one direction only; so that the
whole of the light received by the object-glass should be concen
trated into a fine line of light as narrow as possible, and having
a length not greater than will correspond to that breadth of the
spectrum which (when viewed in the apparatus) will be just suffi
cient to enable the eye to distinguish with ease the dark lines by
 which it may be crossed.     No arrangement tried by us has been
found more suitable to effect this enlargement in one direction
than a cylindrical lens, which was first employed for this purpose
 by Fraunhofer.     In the apparatus by which the spectra described
in our “Note” of February 1863 were observed, the cylindrical
lens employed was plano-convex, of 0-5 inch focal length. This
was placed within the focus of the object-glass and immediately
in front of the slit of the collimator.
   The present form of the apparatus is represented in Plate V.
figs. 1 and 2, where the cylindrical lens is marked a. This is
plano-convex, an inch square, and of about 14 inches focallength.
The lens is mounted in an inner tube, b, sliding within the tube
c, by which the apparatus is adapted to the eye-end of the tele
scope.    The axial direction of the cylindrical surface is placed
at  right angles to the slit d, and the distance of the lens from
the slit within the converging pencils from the object-glass is
such as to give exactly the necessary breadth to the spectrum.
   In consequence of the object-glass being over-corrected, the
red and, especially, the violet pencils are less spread out than the
pencils of intermediate refrangibility; so that the spectrum,                               in
stead of having a uniform breadth, becomes slightly narrower at
the red end, and tapers off in a greater degree towards the more
refrangible extremity*.
   * The experiment was made, of so placing the cylindrical lens that the
axial direction of         its
                       convex cylindrical surface should         parallel with the
                                                                        be

                        Spectra    of some of the Fired Stars.                                   41   l
stars which we have examined, the dark lines appear to be as
fine and as numerous as they are in the solar spectrum.                  The
great breadth of the lines in the green and more refrangible
parts of Sirius and some other stars, as seen in the less perfect
form of apparatus which was first employed, and which band
like appearance was so marked as specially to distinguish them,
has, to a very great extent, disappeared; and though these lines
are still strong, they now appear, as compared with the strongest
of the solar lines, by no means so abnormally broad as to require
these stars to be placed in a class apart. No stars sufficiently
bright to give a spectrum have been observed to be without lines.
The stars admit of no such broad distinctions of classification.
Star differs from star alone in the grouping and arrangement
of the numerous fine lines by which their spectra are crossed.
     6. For the convenience of reference and comparison, a few of
the more characteristic lines of twenty-nine of the elements were
measured with the instrument.             These were laid down to scale,
in order to serve as a      chart,  for the purpose of suggesting, by a
comparison with the lines measured in the star, those elements
 the coincidence of the lines of which with stellar lines was
 probable.

412           Mr. W. Huggins and Dr. W. A. Miller             on the
accordant with those of the same lines taken in the solar
spectrum.
     Before commencing the examination of the spectrum of a star,
the alcohol-lamp was again placed before the object-glass of the
telescope, and the correct adjustment of the apparatus obtained
with certainty. The first observation was whether the star con
tained a double line coincident with the sodium lines D. When
 the presence of such a line had been satisfactorily determined,
 we considered it sufficient in subsequent observations of the same
 star to commence by ascertaining the exact agreement in posi
 tion of this known stellar line with the sodium lines D.
      Since from flexure of the parts of the spectrum-apparatus the
 absolute reading of the micrometer might vary when the tele
 scope was directed to stars differing greatly in altitude, the mea
 sure of the line in the star which was known to be coincident
 with that of sodium was always taken at the commencement and
  at the end of each set of measures.           The distances of the other
  lines from this line, and not the readings of the micrometer,
  were then finally registered as the measures of their position ;
  and these form the numbers given in the Tables, from which
  the diagrams of the star-spectra have been laid down.
       The very close approximation*, not unfrequently the identity,
   of the measures obtained for the same line on different occasions,
   as well as the very exact agreement of the lines laid down from
   these measures with the stellar lines subsequently determined
   by a direct comparison with metallic lines the positions of which
   were known, have given the authors great confidence in the
   minute accuracy of the numbers and drawings which they have
   now the honour of laying before the Society.
                § III.  Observations    on the Moon and Planets.
       7.  It is well known that in the solar spectrum many addi
    tional remarkable lines make their appearance when light from
    the sun seen near the horizon reaches the observer, after having
    traversed a much greater length of our atmosphere than when
    the sun is viewed at greater altitudes.          This circumstance sug
    gested to us the importance of a careful examination of the solar
    light after reflexion from the moon and planets, in reference to
    the extent and analogous constitution of atmospheres possibly
    surrounding these bodies. As far as practicable, the spectra of
    the moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have been observed
    on several occasions with this special object in view.
        8. The Moon.—All the astronomical phenomena in which we
      .*  These measures, on repeated observation, seldom varied more than a
    single division of the scale, or rºarth of the distance between A and H.

should expect to discover indications of an atmosphere about the
moon, if such exist, agree in proving the non-existence of a lunar
atmosphere of sensible amount.      From the absence of appreci
able refraction at the moon’s limb, and from the sudden extinc
tion during a total lunar eclipse of stars of even the tenth and
eleventh magnitude at the limb of the moon, “we are,” writes
Sir John Herschel, “entitled to conclude that no amount of
appreciable vapour is suspended near the surface of the moon,
and . . . . the non-existence of an atmosphere at the moon’s
edge having the 1980th part of the density of the earth’s
atmosphere    *.
     As   by directobservation we know that the solar light is
reflected from the surface of the moon, the light which reaches
the earth after having undergone this reflexion must have passed
through a length of lunar atmosphere, if such exist, at least
equal to double the height of such atmosphere above that sur
face of the moon which is visible to      From some parts    us.the                                 of

indication of similar lines could be detected.     On each of the
three evenings just mentioned successive portions of the moon's
illuminated surface, from the centre to the circumference, were
brought before the slit of the spectrum-apparatus.     The quan
tity of light from different parts was observed to be very differ
ent; but not the smallest change in the lines of the spectrum
could be perceived, either in respect of relative intensity or the
addition or disappearance of any lines”.
    The result of this spectrum analysis of the light reflected by
the moon is wholly negative as to the existence of any consider
able lunar atmospheret.

rapidly changing appearances of the disk of Jupiter, other than
those due to the rotation of the planet, present very strong
evidence of the existence of a very considerable atmosphere
   * [With the spectrum-apparatus described at page 415, the spectra of
particular and very limited regions of the moon's surface can be examined.
The opening of the slit of the apparatus corresponding to a spectrum that
can be separately observed is about      ºfinch x + y inch. The image of
the moon formed by the object-glass of the telescope has a diameter of 1:04
inch. Practically it is found that the light reflected from an area upon the
surface of the moon of about one-third that of Tycho can be analyzed in
the instrument.
   The particular spot of the moon’s surface under observation can be ascer
tained by means of the finder attached to the telescope.    For this purpose,
however,    a special set of wires, accurately adjusted, and an eyepiece of
considerable power are necessary.       When the part of the moon’s surface
under observation presents marked inequalities of illumination, the spectra
of these differently illuminated portions can be easily recognized by the
differences in their comparative brightness.      In these observations the cy
lindrical lens may   be  removed.—August    31,  1864.]

                  Spectra of  some  of the Fired Stars.           415
about Jupiter. The same, though in a much less marked degree,
is probably true of Saturn and Mars.           In addition, the dimi
nished    brightness  of the disk of Jupiter  near the periphery sup
ports the inference that an atmosphere exists about that planet.
     The planet Jupiter was observed on April 12, 1862, and
April 14 and May       1, 1863.    The solar lines B, C, D, E, b, F,
and G were seen, with numerous fine intermediate lines, and D,
E,    b, and  F were measured; but no marked lines other than
those    usually present in the solar spectrum were detected.
    [Since these observations were made, we have had a spectrum
apparatus constructed by Mr. Browning, optician, of the Minories,
which is similar in general arrangement to that already described,
but possesses much less dispersive power. In this apparatus the
cylindrical lens, the collimating lens, and the object-glass of the
small telescope correspond exactly in diameter and in focal length
with those of which a description has been given; but the eye
piece of the telescope is of less power, and has a magnifying
power of about three diameters.         A second eyepiece was occa
sionally used, magnifying nine diameters. Two prisms are em
ployed; one has a refracting angle of 35°, the other a refracting
angle of 45°.
     With this apparatus, in the spectrum of Jupiter a strong line
in the red is seen which is scarcely distinguishable with the more
 powerful instrument, and was from this cause overlooked in our
earlier observations.     The remarkable increase of visibility of this
 line is due to the much greater brilliancy of the spectrum in this
 apparatus; and this is much more than inversely proportional
 to the diminution of the dispersion, since, on account of the
 greatly reduced obliquity of incidence, the loss of light at the
 surfaces of the prisms by reflexion is much less.      This saving of
 light in the spectrum-apparatus is of very great importance in
 observations of the planetary spectra.       The image of a planet in
  the telescope is not a point, but forms a disk of considerable
  magnitude relatively to the image of a star. Of this image, en
  larged in one direction by the cylindrical lens, a very narrow
  section only, corresponding to the breadth of the slit, passes on
  through the collimating lens to the prisms; and this portion
  only of the total light collected by the object-glass becomes
  available to form the spectrum.       On this account we have found
  the observations of the   planets  much more difficult than would
  be observations of stars possessing an equal apparent brilliancy.
     This band of which we are now speaking in the spectrum of
 Jupiter occurs in a rather obscure part of the spectrum; more
 over, by the instrument of greater dispersive power, it appears
 to be resolved into two or more lines, which are severally very
 faint, and are less visible than a single stronger line. The alti

tude of Jupiter being small (about 22° above the horizon) at the
time of observation, it was of great importance to have satisfac
tory evidence that this band was not due to absorption by our
atmosphere.
   On June 16, 1864, the moon and Jupiter being near each
other in the sky, the opportunity was seized to compare directly
the moon’s light with that of Jupiter under precisely similar
conditions of atmosphere. The observations of this evening were
decisive in showing that this band in the spectrum of Jupiter
was due to a modification suffered by the solar light before
reaching our atmosphere, and therefore due probably to absorp
tion by the atmosphere of Jupiter.
   On June 20, and on July 12 and 14, an observation still more
crucial was obtained.       The length of the opening of the slit is
much greater than the diameter of the telescopic image of
                                                                                                   If,

   Other lines less refrangible were perceived in the spectrum of
Jupiter, but   were not sufficiently distinct to be measured.     The
bands in the     orange   and the red to which we have      referred,
when examined in the spectrum-apparatus of greater dispersive
power, and with a much stronger illumination by directing the
apparatus to the sun when near the horizon, are resolved into
groups of lines. The stronger of these lines are represented in
the upper spectrum of the diagram. The relative position of the
band in the red due to lines of oxygen and nitrogen when the
induction-spark is taken in air, is shown below the spectrum of
Jupiter.    This band is in a small degree more refrangible than
the strong band due to Jupiter.
   If this band, at 914 of the scale, in Jupiter’s spectrum con
sists of lines severally coincident with the lines composing the
faint atmospheric band with which it appears to correspond in
position, it would seem entitled to be regarded as an evidence of
the similarity of Jupiter's atmosphere to our own, with respect
at least to one of            its
                       constituents,             the vapours diffused
                                                          or             of

would appear       oppose the supposition that Jupiter's atmosphere
                     to
is  identical with our own. This negative evidence, however,
cannot        be
            regarded         much weight, since telescopic observa
                                    as   of
tions show that the      light which we receive from Jupiter       for                             is
the most part reflected from clouds floating                atmosphere        in   its                   at
 an elevation above the    planetary   surface. The solar light, there

     [On August 10 and 29, 1864, we re-examined Mars, using
 the new spectrum-apparatus.           No lines in the red, similar to
 those of  Jupiter  and   Saturn,   were observed; but in the extreme
 red, probably about B and a, two or three strong lines were seen.
 With the exception of these, no lines were detected in the red,
orange, yellow, and green portions of the spectrum, other than
 those of the solar spectrum.         At about F the brilliancy of the
 spectrum diminishes in a remarkable manner, in consequence of
 a series of strong and nearly equidistant bands, which com
 mences at F and continues towards the more refrangible end as
 far as the spectrum can be traced. The absorption of these
 bands is evidently the cause of the predominance of the red rays
 in the light of this planet.
    The spectrum-apparatus of greater power resolves these bands
 in the blue into groups of lines.—August 31, 1864.]
     The light of Venus gives a spectrum of great beauty. The
 observations were chiefly made on April 17, 22, and 26, 1863.
 The line D was seen double. B, C, and numerous solar lines to
 a little distance beyond G, were distinctly visible; and the prin
 cipal of these were measured and found to agree with correspond
 ing lines in the solar spectrum. Lines other than these, and in
 the position in which the stronger atmospheric lines present
 themselves, were carefully looked for, but no satisfactory evidence
 of any such lines has been obtained. Venus was observed as
 early in the evening as possible, and while a considerable amount
 of daylight still remained.
     The imperfect evidence which analysis by the prism affords of
 the existence of atmospheres around these planets, notwithstand
 ing the high probability, amounting almost to certainty in the
 case of Jupiter, that such atmospheres do exist, may receive an
 explanation in the supposition that the light is chiefly reflected,
 not from the planetary surfaces, but from masses of cloud in the
 upper strata of their atmospheres.           In this case the length of

spectra of the ansae of the rings to be brighter than that of the ball. The
dark lines in the red and orange, however, were less distinct in the light of
the rings than in that of the ball. This observation is in accordance with
the telescopic appearance of Saturn and his rings when viewed with high
powers.]

considerably lessened.    With perhaps the exception of Mars,
telescopic observations are in favour of such a supposition.
               § IV. Observations on the Fired Stars.
    10. The number of fixed stars which we have, to a greater or
less extent, examined amounts to nearly 50. We have, however,
concentrated our efforts upon three or four of the brighter stars;
 and two only of these have been mapped with any degree of
completeness. These spectra are, indeed, as rich in lines as that
of the sun; and even with these it may be advantageous to com
pare the spectra of additional metals when the season is again
 favourable.    The few really fine nights that are available whilst
 the star is well situated for such observations, in respect of alti
 tude and the time of sun-setting, necessarily make the complete
 investigation even of a single star the work of some years.
    11. Aldebaran (a Tauri) (Plate VI.).-The light of this star is
 of a pale red. When viewed in the spectroscope, numerous strong
 lines are at once evident, particularly in the orange, the green,
 and the blue portions.    The positions of about seventy of these
 lines have been   measured,  and their places have been given in
the Table.      Besides these, numerous other strong lines are
visible, particularly in the blue; but they have not been measured,
owing to the feebleness of the light; we have therefore not                        in
serted them in the Table or in the diagram.        A similar remark
is applicable also to the results of our examination of a Orionis
and S Pegasi.
    We have compared the spectra of sixteen of the terrestrial
elements by simultaneous observation with the spectrum of
Aldebaran, of course selecting those in which we had reason,
from the observations, to believe coincidence was most likely to
occur.     Nine of these spectra exhibited lines coincident with
 certain lines in the spectrum of the star. They are as follows:–
 sodium, magnesium, hydrogen, calcium, iron, bismuth, tellurium,
 antimony, and mercury.
    (1) Sodium.—The double line at D was coincident with a
 double line in the stellar spectrum.
      (2)Magnesium.—The three components

     (4) Calcium.—Electrodes      ofthe metal were used; four lines
 in   itsspectrum were observed       to
                                      coincide with four            of
                                                            the stellar
 lines.

   (5) Iron.—The lines in the spectrum of this metal are very
numerous, but not remarkable for intensity.        There was a
double line corresponding to E in the solar spectrum, and three
other more refrangible well-marked lines coincident with lines in
the star.
   (6) Bismuth.-Four strong lines in the spectrum of this metal
coincided with four in the star-spectrum.
   (7) Tellurium.—In the spectrum of this metal also four of
the strongest lines coincided with four in the spectrum of the
Star.
   (8) Antimony.—Three        of the lines in the spectrum of anti
mony were observed to coincide with stellar lines.
   (9) Mercury.—Four of the brightest lines in the mercury
spectrum correspond in position with four lines of the star.
   It must not be supposed that other lines in the spectra of                                        all

   The spectra obtained from sixteen elementary bodies were
observed simultaneously with the spectrum of 2. Orionis.     In
five of these, viz. sodium, magnesium, calcium, iron, and bis
muth, lines corresponding with certain stellar lines were found
to exist.
   (1) Sodium.—The lines coincident with D are fainter in this
star than in Aldebaran.
   (2) Magnesium.—Decided group of three stellar lines coinci
dent with the group at b.
   (3) Calcium.—Four lines of this metal were on two different
occasions seen to be coincident with four lines in the spectrum
of the star.
  (4) Iron.—The double line of this metal at E, and three other
more refrangible bright lines, coincide with lines in the star
spectrum.
    (5) Bismuth.-In the spectrum of this metal also, four lines
were found to coincide with four in the stellar spectrum.
    Thallium.—The bright green line so characteristic of this
metal appears to coincide with one of the lines seen in the star
spectrum; but this line may be due to calcium, since the small
difference between the position of the thallium line and that of
one of the calcium lines very close to it would not be distinguish
able with the dispersive power of the apparatus employed.
     Inthe spectra of the other elements which we compared with
that of the star, no coincidences occur.
   Hydrogen.—There is no line coincident with the red line C of
hydrogen; but in the star are two strong lines, one on either
side of the position of C: there is also no line coincident with F.
It is strikingly confirmatory of this method of analysis, that in

                            Spectra     of some of the          Fived Stars.                         423
lines C and F are highly characteristic of the solar spectrum and
of the spectra of by far the larger number of the fixed stars to
which our observations have been extended.
   These exceptions are further interesting as they seem to prove
that the lines C and F are due to the luminous bodies them
selves. Of this some doubt might be entertained, and it might be
suspected that they are in some way due to our own atmosphere,
if these lines were present in the spectra of all the stars without
exception.
   This absence of the lines corresponding to hydrogen is also
the more entitled to consideration since it is so rare to find them
wanting, amongst the considerable number of stellar spectra
which we have observed.

Th;       problem to which the following remarks relate may be
      thus enunciated:—To determine the greatest solid of revo
lution, the surface of which is given, and which cuts the axis at
two fixed points. The problem has been discussed in the Philo
sophical Magazine for July 1861, August 1861, September
1862, and March 1866; but something may,                       I

   Adopting the usual notation, we have to make Tºyºde a
maximum, while       2T) y W(1+p°)da               is given.       Let a be a con
stant at present undetermined; then we have by the received
theory to make u a maximum, where u denotes

where b is another constant, which is introduced                                           by the      inte
gration.
  Since the curve is to meet the axis, we have                                        y=0       at certain
points; hence b=0, and the equation becomes
                                    {viz,     2a
                                                              tº }y=0
                                                                      y=U.

Thus we have either                                     +y=0, or y=0. The first cor

responds to a sphere, and the second to a cylinder, of indefinitely
small radius.      This solution is due to the Astronomer Royal;
it is  given in the Philosophical Magazine for July 1861, and
illustrated by figures.
    There     is,
              however, one difficulty which still exists.      On pro
ceeding      verify the solution,
             to                       find that the terms denoted by

B   vanish    the limits; also
                 at                 vanishes for   A   that part    the         all                  of
solution which    corresponds     the  sphere;    to
                                                but     does not vanish           A
for the remaining part                   of
                             the solution.       fact,   we put y=0,    In            if
we find that A=2a.       Thus instead       having  &u=0,        of
                                                             we have

the  range which corresponds the  cylindrical  portion tothe                                         of

difficulty.

        the value            must                    Thus 8u, instead
being zero,       essentially
                    is            small negative quantity; this, how
                                              a

   The following consideration will,             think, show that

428              Dr. A. Paalzow on the Heat of the Electric Spark.
was replaced by two electrodes and sparks were allowed to leap
across the intermediate space, Knochenhauer observed a depres
sion of the column of liquid, dependent on the quantity and ten
sion of the electricity; but he ascribed this phenomenon not to
the heat generated by the sparks, but to the mechanical move
ment of the air.
   The main object of the subjoined experiments was to establish
a connexion between the heat of the spark, the quantity and
tension of the electricity, and the resistance of the apparatus;
and as these three magnitudes can be most readily varied and
increased in the case of the Leyden jar, it seemed expedient, first
of all, to study the thermal relations of sparks from the Leyden
battery.
      #. heat               of the spark was                       determined by three different
methods:–

were screwed (air-tight) from              millims. apart. They were

   It appears therefore that intense heating of the sparks by
great resistance in the circuit, striation of light, and incandes
cence of the negative wire are only observed when the duration
of discharge has been augmented by great resistance, and when
the velocity of electricity, and consequently the mechanical move
ment of the medium in which the spark appears is very small—in
which case only could we first predicate of the                that     plays        air         it

           GENTLEMEN,
       the third edition of my ‘Treatise on the Figure of the
    IN Earth’  I have introduced the following proposition (see
    page 80,
           Art. 84):—
    “PRop. To prove that if the form of                                               the earth's surface be a
 spheroid of equilibrium, the earth’s mass                                             must necessarily be                     ar
ranged according to the fluid law, whether the mass is or has been
fluid or not, in part or in whole.”
    Exception has been taken by a friendly reviewer of the book
in your Number for February last, to my demonstration of this
                                   I
proposition; and am free to admit that his criticism has some

The object had in introducing it state in the previous article I
of my book. It was to refute a wrong notion which has of late
years appeared in print, that the law of gravity at the surface of
the earth can be obtained theoretically without any reference to
the arrangement of the mass.      The original investigation from
which this result was supposed to flow is referred to at p. 190 of
Mr. Airy's ‘Mathematical Tracts,’ fourth edition; and the fol
lowing is an extract from the investigation                                   itself:-
   “Without assuming the earth's original fluidity, but merely sup
posing it consists of nearly spherical strata of equal density, and

derived from reflections on fluid-pressure.     The geodesist mea

mean axes.     But whence has he derived his conception that the

theory, and nowhere else. We cannot do without the fluid theory;
 and to my own mind the evidence, especially from pendulum
 experiments, and more particularly the influence of the bulging
 out of the internal strata upon the pendulum (see from p. 85 to
 97 of my Treatise), is quite overwhelming in favour of the con
 clusion that the distribution of the mass at present is proximately
 according to the fluid-law.

 436                   Prof. Tyndall on Calorescence.
    From the setting of paper on fire, and the fusion of non
 refractory metals, to the rendering of refractory bodies incandes
 cent, the step was immediate. To avoid waste by conduction,
 it was necessary to employ the metals in plates as thin as pos
 sible. A few preliminary experiments with platinum-foil, which
 resulted in failure, raised the question whether, even with the
 total radiation of the electric light, it would be possible to obtain
 incandescence without combustion.                 Abandoning the use of
 lenses altogether,     I  caused a thin leaf of platinum to approach
 the  ignited  coal-points.     It was observed by myself from behind,
 while my assistant stood beside the lamp, and, looking through
 a dark glass, observed the distance between the platinum-foil
 and the electric light. At half an inch from the carbon-points
the metal became red-hot.            The problem now was to obtain at
 a greater  distance a focus which should possess a heating-power
 equal to that of the direct rays at a distance of half an inch.
    In the first attempt the direct rays were utilized as much as
 possible. A piece of platinum-foil was placed at a distance of
 an inch from the carbon-points, there receiving the direct radia
tion.    The rays emitted backwards from the points were at the
 same time converged by a small mirror upon the foil, and were
found more than sufficient to compensate for the diminution of
intensity due to the withdrawal of the foil to the distance of an
inch.     By the same method incandescence was subsequently
obtained when the foil was removed two, and even three, inches
from the carbon-points.
    The last-mentioned distance allowed me to introduce between
made at the time. A glass globe, 3% inches in diameter, was filled with
the opake solution, and placed in front of the electric light. An intense
focus of invisible rays was formed immediately beyond the globe. Black
paper held in this focus was pierced, a burning ring being produced.         A
 second spherical flask, 9 inches in diameter, was filled with the solution
 and employed as a lens. The effects, however, were less powerful than
those obtained with the smaller flask.
   Two plano-convex     lenses of rock-salt, 3 inches in diameter, were placed
with their flat surfaces opposite, but separated from each other by a brass
ring ºths of an inch thick. The space between the plates was filled with
the solution, and thus an opake lens was formed.        Paper was fired by this
lens. In none of these cases, however, could the paper be caused to blaze.
Hollow plano-convex lenses filled with the solution were not effective, the
focal length of those at my disposal being too great.
   Mr. Mayall was so extremely obliging as to transfer his great photogra
phic camera from Brighton to London, for the purpose of enabling me to
operate with the fine glass lens, 20 inches in diameter, which belonged to
it: the result was not successful. It will, however, be subsequently shown
that both the hollow lens and the glass lens are effective when, instead of

The bisulphide of carbon is an extremely inflammable substance;
and on the 2nd of November, while employing a very powerful
battery and intensely heated carbon-points, the solution took
fire, and instantly enveloped the electric lamp and                       appur              all     its

   A  piece of platinized platinum-foil was supported in an ex
hausted receiver, the vessel being so placed that the focus fell
upon the platinum.       The heat of the focus was instantly con

   Blackened paper was now substituted for the platinum in the
exhausted receiver.     Placed at the focus of invisible rays, the
paper was instantly pierced, a cloud of smoke was poured though
the opening, and fell like a cascade to the bottom of the receiver.
The paper seemed to burn without incandescence.            Here also a
thermograph of the coal-points was stamped out. When black
paper is placed at the focus, where the thermal image is well
defined, it is always pierced in two points, answering to the
images of the two carbons. The superior heat of the positive
carbon is shown by the fact that                         its
                                             image first pierces the

 the calorific action of the extra-violet rays is so exceedingly
 feeble   (in fact     immeasurably small) that, even supposing them
                            so
 to  reach the platinum, their heating-power would                      utterly            be   an
 vanishing quantity.         Still mechanical considerations rendered
 the exclusion          of rays, all    higher refrangibility than those

kingly illustrated by these experiments. The air at the focus
may be of a freezing temperature, while the aether possesses an
amount of heat competent, if absorbed, to impart to that air the
temperature of flame.   An air-thermometer is unaffected where
platinum is raised to a white heat. Numerous experiments will
suggest themselves to every one who wishes to operate upon the
invisible heat-rays. The dense volumes of smoke which rise
from a blackened block of wood when it is placed in the dark
focus are very striking : matches are of course at once ignited,
and gunpowder instantly exploded.     Dry black paper held there
bursts into flame.   Chips of wood are also inflamed: the dry
wood of a hat-box is very suitable for this experiment.   When
a sheet of brown paper is placed a little beyond the focus, it is
first brought to vivid incandescence over a large space; the
paper then yields, and the combustion propagates itself as a
burning ring round the centre of ignition. Charcoal is reduced
to an ember at the focus, and disks of charred paper glow with
extreme vividness.   Sheet-lead and tin, if blackened, may be
fused, while a thick cake of fusible metal is quickly pierced and
melted.   Blackened zinc-foil placed at the focus bursts into
flame; and by drawing the foil slowly through the focus, its
ignition may be kept up till the whole of the foil is consumed.
Magnesium wire, flattened at the end and blackened, also bursts
into vivid combustion. A cigar or a tobacco-pipe may of course
be instantly lighted at the dark focus. The bodies experimented
on may be enclosed in glass receivers; the concentrated rays will
still burn them, after having crossed the glass. A small chip
of wood in a jar of oxygen bursts suddenly into flame; char
coal burns, while charcoal-bark throws out suddenly showers of
                                                    -
scintillations.

mingled with them; they were exclusively extra-red. The action
of the atoms of platinum, copper, silver, and carbon upon                                                 these
rays transmutes them from heat-rays into light-rays. They
impinge upon the platinum at a certain rate; they return from
it at a quicker rate. Their refrangibility is thus raised, the                                              in
visible being rendered visible.
   To express this transmutation of heat-rays into others of
higher refrangibility,                I
                        would propose the term calorescence.   It
harmonizes well with the term “fluorescence” introduced by
Professor Stokes, and is also suggestive of the character of the
effects to which it is applied.  The phrase “transmutation of
rays,” introduced by Professor Challis”, covers both classes of
effects.

making use of two lamps, two mirrors, and two filters, and con
verging the heat of both lamps in opposite directions upon the

raised it to dazzling whiteness.                                 I
                                            am persuaded that the metal

                           much lowered that fusion was not effected.
By coating the platinum with lampblack               has been brought                                               to

treated, are speedily burnt up.

the  Royal    School of Mines in Jermyn Street. The focus was
formed in a darkened chamber, in which the platinized platinum
foil was exposed.      Cutting off the visible rays by the solution of
iodine, feeble but distinct incandescence was there produced by
the invisible rays.
   A blackened tin tube (A B, fig. 10, Plate IV.) with square cross
section and open at one end, was furnished at the other with a
plane mirror (a y) forming an angle of 45° with the axis of the
tube.     A lateral aperture (a       about        0),

focus of the lens on the roof of the Royal Institution.
   Knowing the permeability of good glass to the solar rays, I
requested Mr. Mayall to permit me to make a few experiments
with his fine photographic lens at Brighton. Though exceed
ingly busy at the time, he in the kindest manner abandoned to
iny assistant, Mr. Barrett, the use of his apparatus for the three
best hours of a bright summer's day. A red heat was obtained
 at the focus of the lens after the complete withdrawal of the
 luminous portion of the radiation.
     § 9. Black         has been very frequently employed in the
                      paper
foregoing experiments, the action of the invisible rays upon it
being most energetic. This suggests that the absorption of those
rays is not independent of colour. A red powder is red because
of the entrance and absorption of the luminous rays of higher
refrangibility than the red, and the ejection of the unabsorbed
red light by reflexion at the limiting surfaces of the particles of
the red body. This feebleness of absorption of the red rays
 extends to the rays of greater length beyond the red; and the
consequence is that red paper when exposed at the focus of invi
 sible rays is scarcely charred, while black paper bursts in a
 moment into flame.      The following Table exhibits the condition
 of  paper  of various kinds when exposed at the dark focus of an
 electric light of moderate intensity.

   The extremely remarkable fact here reveals itself, that when
the beam of the electric lamp is sifted by certain blue glasses, the
platinum at the focus glows with a distinct pink colour.       Every
care was taken to avoid subjective illusion here.         The pink
colour was also obtained at the focus of invisible    rays.   With
drawing       all
             the glasses, and filtering the beam         solution                     by   a                  of

dimmed the brilliancy of the thermograph.            The intense calo
rific rays of the electric light pass through such glass with free
dom. We here come to a point of considerable practical import
ance to meteorologists. When such pure-white glass has carbon
mixed with it when in a molten condition, the resulting black
glass is still eminently transparent to those invisible heat-rays
which constitute the greater part of the sun’s radiation.           I have

entire absorption          of
                       the solar rays. This conclusion         fallacious,    is

      ELDMANN*                  has investigated the roots of the Laserpitium
          latifolium,          L., and has found that this plant, like many
others which are botanically allied, contains a peculiar new crys
tallized substance to which he has assigned the name Laserpitine.
    The finely-cut roots are exhausted by alcohol of 80 per cent.
at a temperature of 60°, and of the filtered extracts as much
alcohol as possible distilled off in the water-bath.             On cooling,
the liquid separates into two layers—a lower aqueous layer, and
an upper brownish-coloured resinous one.               This latter contains,
along with some resin, nearly                             all

were obtained, which, by their properties and by analysis,                                             were
identified as angelic acid, C19H80°.
   While the liquid, which in the above experiment had been
supersaturated with sulphuric acid, was being distilled, brownish
red oily drops were formed which gradually sank to the bottom.
When these were purified, a body was obtained in a crystallized
condition which had many of the properties of an alcohol, and
which Feldmann calls laserole.
   The author found the composition of laserpitine to be
C*H*O”;       and             its
                     decomposition into laserole and angelic acid
isthus  expressed:

   Phenose is obtained as a feebly-coloured amorphous mass
which deliquesces in the air; it tastes sweet like grape-sugar,
with a sharp after-taste. It is soluble in water and alcohol, but
not in ether. When heated it becomes brown, and above 100°
it decomposes with the formation of a caramel odour.
   Heated either with acids or alkalies, it is rapidly changed into
humus-like bodies. The latter form also an acid, which seems to
correspond to the glucic acid which is formed from grape-sugar.

   The acid is remarkable for great stability; when heated above
100°, it sublimes in very beautiful lustrous crystals.    It is a
strong acid, and forms with ammonium and barium easily soluble
crystallized salts.
   When the acid is treated with hydriodic acid, it is decomposed
with liberation of iodine, and separation of a hydrocarbon which
is probably cymole, formed in accordance with the equation

     Bauer has made+ another addition to the series                         of bodies iso
meric with acetylene, which he had already enriched by the dis
covery of rutylenet.
   With a view to obtaining oxide of triamylene, he prepared the
bromide of triamylene, Gº Hº Brº, and acted with this body on
acetate of silver for some days at the temperature of 100°.
The mass having been exhausted with ether, the ethereal solution
was evaporated     and the residue distilled in an oil-bath.     This
distillate was treated with solid powdered caustic potash and
again distilled.      The product thus obtained consisted of two
layers: the lower one was water; the upper layer was subjected
to fractional distillation, by which it was found to consist of a
liquid distilling between 230° and 240° C. On analysis this
body proved to be a new hydrocarbon, which has the formula
C*H*. Bauer names it benylene, to denote both relation                       its

dant red  precipitate of cuprous  acetylene  is formed, both in con
tact with the flame and below. The experiment may be made
with chloride of ethyle, C*H* Cl, and propylene, C*H".
   With marsh-gas, C*H, acetylene is formed in like manner,
though with less brilliancy.    Its formation under these circum
stances is a direct  proof of the condensation which marsh-gas
undergoes under the influence of heat.      Thus

    2. It is more especially in the case of volatile liquids that this
formation of acetylene in incomplete combustion is met with. It
 may well be shown by means of ether, a few drops of which are
introduced into such a gas-jar as is mentioned above.                Two or
three cubic centimetres of ammoniacal solution of cuprous chlo
ride being added and the ether lighted, the jar is inclined almost
horizontally and turned round; in a moment the entire inner
surface is lined with a blood-red coating of cuprous acetylene.
This is a beautiful lecture experiment; and the quantity of ace
tylene formed makes it probable that a convenient method for
preparing acetylene may be based on this experiment.

a mixture of hydrogen and bisulphide of carbon. The action is
slower, however, than in the preceding case.
   The formation of acetylene in a mixture of carbonic oxide and
hydrogen is still more difficult; the passage of the electric spark
must be continued for ten hours.
   De Wilde describes” several experiments which he had under
taken with a view of obtaining a ready means of preparing ace
tylene.  Dutch liquid, chloride of ethylene, C*H*CI*, may be
regarded as consisting of acetylene and hydrochloric acid; and
it might possibly, under the influence of heat, decompose into
acetylene and hydrochloric acid, according to the equation
                       C4H4 Cl2=C4H2+2 HCl.
When the vapour of chloride of ethylene is passed through a
porcelain tube heated to bright redness, a portion does indeed
decompose in this manner, but the quantity formed is so small
as to render this mode of formation of little use; in fact 100
grms. of the liquid only yielded about 2 litres of the gas.
   A well-known experiment consists in mixing ethylene gas and
chlorine, and setting fire to the mixture, by which a large quan
tity of carbon is deposited,—it being assumed that the mixture
is decomposed into carbon and hydrochloric acid:
                       C4H4+4Cl=C4+4HCl.
   De Wilde has shown that in this case some acetylene is formed.
He also found, independently of Berthelot, that acetylene is
formed in the incomplete combustion of ethylene and of coal
gas, but, as Berthelot observes,              did not establish the general
character of this reaction.
   The remarkable property which platinum-black and spongy
platinum possess of condensing large quantities of gas, led De
Wilde to try the experiment whether hydrogen could not in this
way be fixed on certain organic compounds.       An experiment
was first made with acetylene.   A small quantity of compressed
platinum-black of the size of a pea was introduced into a mea
sured quantity of hydrogen in a jar of this gas standing over
mercury; the platinum was then removed and placed in a mea
sured volume of acetylene.    An immediate absorption is set up,
which is complete after the lapse of half an hour.    Numerous
experiments showed that when the hydrogen was in excess, two
volumes of hydrogen absorbed exactly one volume of acetylene;
the odour of acetylene completely disappeared, and     presence      its
could scarcely    be   detected        by   means    of   ammoniacal solution   of

IN Magazine
        an article contained in the Number of the Philosophical
                    for May, I have completed the discussion and
exemplification of the mathematical reasoning proper for de
termining the motion and pressure of an elastic fluid, so far
at least as that reasoning may be required for the mainte
nance of the general physical theory respecting matter and
force, the principles of which         I   have on several occasions ex
pounded in this Journal.          I  propose   now, with the aid of the
mathematical results obtained in that and previous communica
tions, to reassert those principles, and to answer certain objec
tions to them which        I  have chanced to meet with in the writings
of  my   contemporaries.        But before commencing this discussion,
I  am desirous of     adverting   as briefly as possible to two points in
the mathematical reasoning which have recently appeared to me
to admit of further elucidation.
    The first point is the numerical determination of the velocity
of propagation in an elastic fluid. Assuming that the analytical
                                                                       2

I propose to consider        in what way the numerical value of the
factor   by which a is     multiplied  may be obtained.      In the course
of  supplementary     considerations relating to the Undulatory Theory
of Light contained in the Philosophical Magazine for May 1865,
I  have shown that my first determination of the value of that
factor is erroneous, and have arrived at a different result by a
process the legitimacy of which          I  have not hitherto seen reason
to question.      In this new method, instead of the equation to
which the mathematical reasoning conducts, viz.

of the same quantities.       Hence for a given value of r, the velo
 city w parallel to the axis and the condensation a are functions
of z-rat. We may therefore conclude that the composite velo
 city and condensation relative to an axis, so far as their expres
 sions to terms of the second order indicate, are propagated in
directions parallel to the axis with the uniform velocity ca.
    In the same article the reasoning is extended to the case of
vibrations relative to any number of axes having any positions in
space, terms of the second order being still included; and on
examining the conclusion of the investigation, it will be seen
that, for the case in which the axes are        parallel, the resultant          all
velocity parallel                to
                       the axes and the resultant condensation are                                                    at

                             this view Newton has not been followed                                               by
modern philosophers.

which personal sensation and experience render perfectly intelli

the hypotheses, after all, rests on a comparison of consequences
mathematically deduced from them with actual phenomena, and
on their capability of explaining the phenomena.         For the sake
of illustration I shall first show how the hypotheses of the Theory
of Gravitation satisfy the above conditions, before        proceed to              I
consider whether they are satisfied by the hypotheses of my
Physical Theory.
   In the Theory of Gravitation it is supposed that             bodies                      all
attract each other with forces which          given distance are pro

portional     their masses, and
              to                    different distances vary inversely
                                              at

                    the distances. This law     the variation              of                           of

going statement of them with the accompanying remarks may
suffice to show that they are such as to satisfy the conditions
which, as before said, are requisites of the hypotheses of a phy
sical theory. The opinion generally entertained that gravity is
an essential property of matter forms no part of the theory.               It
is a  gratuitous   speculation    without   physical  significance.
   Before dismissing the subject of gravity, another remark may
be appropriately made, bearing upon the relation of the force of
gravity to a general physical theory. Assuming, as the present
state of physical astronomy allows us to do, that the Theory of
Gravitation has been established by the combination of calcula
tion with observation, it will follow that the hypotheses of the
theory are proved to be physical realities.             But the terms in
which they are expressed sufficiently show that they are not
ultimate facts, but rather laws, and as such deducible by mathe
matical reasoning from the fundamental ideas of matter and
force, it being a rule of philosophy that                 quantitative laws    all
              priori deduction from initial principles.          The hypo

Physical Theory already enunciated, which             now proceed              I                                   to
discuss one            by
                  one, with the view         showing that they are
                                                                 of

would not      distinguishable
                  be             from space.    All bodies, therefore,
have parts that are not separable into other parts; that           they                                      is,

of atomic constitution       supported  is    chemical analysis and  by

                 Matter and Force in Theoretical Physics.                                                467
synthesis, and by the facts that bodies may be broken, may
change as to form by alteration of the relative positions of the
parts, and may change as to magnitude by compression or dila
tation.    The last fact implies that the atoms are separated by
                                -
spatial intervals.
    (2) The essential qualities of matter are those we perceive by
 the senses. This is Newton’s fundamental principle. All bodies
of which we take cognizance by the senses have form. There
fore the atoms, or ultimate constituents of bodies, have form;
otherwise they want an essential quality of matter. Change of
form, which we perceive bodies to be capable of, is a consequence
of atomic constitution, and therefore cannot be predicated of the
 atoms themselves.
     (3) All that is said in paragraph (2) is equally true if magni
 tude be substituted for form.
     (4) We know what inertia is by experience of it in masses,
and it is found by experiment to be always the same in the same
quantity of matter independently of                              all
                                               other properties. Hence
                an
                essential quality       matter, sui generis, existing                                        in

 inertiais
 masses   only  because      exists
                                  it   their ultimate parts. Thus the
            bodies are essentially inert.

other suggests this hypothesis, is the ascertained velocity of
light, which is so great as to be scarcely compatible with the
 transmission of matter, and may reasonably be ascribed to trans
 mission of motion, like the propagation through the                    waves                        air   of

470                 Prof. Challis on the Fundamental Ideas of
sical force, or perhaps resolve it into volition. This, however, is
approaching very closely to the region of metaphysics; and as
far as regards physical research, it suffices to take the law of the
proportionate variation of the density and pressure of the aether
as an ultimate fact.

        All

that do not hold       myself  responsible  for these hypotheses, not
perceiving how any others could be framed consistently with a

and to the essential requisites of the foundations of science.
The real difficulty that stands in the way of the progress of
theoretical physics is a mathematical one—that of discover
ing the true methods of applying differential equations of three
or more variables, and their integrals, for finding the mo
tion and pressure of a fluid under given circumstances. This
is purely a matter of reasoning, and by reasoning only can
it be settled. It is in endeavours to surmount this difficulty
        I
that have for many years given attention to the mathematical
theory of the motion of fluids; and though                           I
                                                   have succeeded to a
considerable    extent,         I
                           am well aware that much remains to be
done.     In particular it may be mentioned that have not ob              I
tained an analytical expression for the quantity called h towards
the end of the article in the May Number, the determination of
which is of much importance relative to the theory of attractive
and repulsive forces.       Having spent a great deal of time and
thought on these researches,                 I
                                      must now leave to others, who
may think it worth their while, the task of pursuing them

472                 Prof. Challis on the Fundamental Ideas of
attraction of gravity.    The other physical forces, electricity, gal
vanism, and magnetism, are referable, not to vibrations, but to
steady motions of the aether; and many of the more obvious phe
momena are at once explained by hydrodynamical theorems.           It
remains for me to meet certain objections which have been made
to the views            I
                 have been maintaining, and to notice some ob
stacles which stand in the way of their being received.
   In the Philosophical Magazine for July 1865, in a note at the
bottom of page 64,                    I
                         have remarked that the expression “finite
atoms l” occurs.    A note of admiration is no argument, but it
expresses an opinion, and may express a prejudice.         After the
argument respecting atoms contained in this communication,                                                             I
think it needless to do more than state a counter opinion. The
author of this note of admiration, in upholding the law of “con
servation of energy,” has found it necessary to account for waste
of energy; and in attempting to do this a difficulty is met with
which has led to the making and making again of hypotheses
destitute of            all
                 verisimilitude.   This difficulty arises from the
adoption           of
               system  a   philosophy that rejects the finite atom.

particular arrangements of their discrete atoms, and will, think,                                       I
eventually be accounted for by ascertaining the laws according
to which the aether (such as I conceive it to be) acts on the
individual atoms. But there is no reason from experience to
conclude that crystalline structure is the property of masses
that are not of comparatively limited extent.    It plainly exists
only in the solid state, and is therefore dependent on the mole
cular conditions which separate the solid from the fluid state.
But these conditions have reference only to the state of aggrega
tion of the atoms very near the confines of the substance, which
clearly must be different from the state of aggregation in
                                                                                                                    by

THE   “Further    Observations on the Spectra        of some of the Nebulae,
with a Mode of determining the Brightness             of these Bodies.” By
 William Huggins, F.R.S.
    In the first part of this paper the author continues his observations
on the spectra of nebulae and clusters. The results already presented
by him to the Royal Society are confirmed by his new observations,
namely, that with his apparatus clusters and nebulae give either a
continuous spectrum or a spectrum consisting of one, two, or three
bright lines. The positions in the spectrum of these lines are the
same as those of the bright lines of the nebulae described in his former
  apers.                                 -
p
   On account of the faintness of these objects the author was not
able to ascertain whether the continuous spectra which some of the
nebulae give are interrupted by dark lines in a manner similar to
the spectra of the sun and fixed stars. Some of these spectra appear
irregularly bright in some parts of the spectrum.
   The nebulae which follow have a spectrum of one, two, or three
bright lines; in addition to which, in the case of some of them, a
faint continuous spectrum was visible.            These bodies are probably
gaseous in constitution.

   The second part of the paper contains an account of a mode of
determining approximatively the intrinsic brightness of some of the
nebulae.

distant from the places where external forces are applied, to eliminate
the local irregularities produced by their application.

    The following communications were read:—
    1. “Documents relating to the formation of a new island in the
neighbourhood of the Kameni Islands.”            By St. Vincent Lloyd,
Esq., H.M. Consul at Syra, A. Delenda, Esq., Consular Agent at
 Santorino, and M. Décigala.
    In these documents it was stated that on or about February 1st
 the sea in the neighbourhood of the Kameni Islands, in the centre of
 the crater forming the harbour of Santorino, began to show signs of
 volcanic action, and that the result has been the formation of a new
 island, which has since become nearly joined to the south of the
 island Nea Kameni. Details of the volcanic phenomena observed
 up to February 7th were given in the letters from Messrs. Lloyd and
 Delenda; and in the impression of “La Grèce’ newspaper of
 February 15th, M. Décigala gave an account of the further progress
 of the upheaval and increase of the new island, which he had named
“George the First.”
    2. “On    the   Carboniferous     Slate (Devonian Rocks) of North
 Devon and South Ireland.”             By  J. Beete Jukes, Esq., M.A.,
F.R.S., F.G.S.
    Mr. Jukes gave     a sketch of the geological structure of the south
  west of Ireland,  tracing   the Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous
 Limestone from Wexford through Waterford into Cork, and show
  ing that some thin beds of black shale which intervened between
  those groups on the east expanded westwards until they acquired

478                                    Geological Society:—
a thickness of two or three thousand feet. The group then received
Sir R. I. Griffith's appellation of Carboniferous Slate. The Old
Red Sandstone similarly expanded to the west, from a thickness of
a few hundred feet in Wexford to one of several thousand feet in
North Cork. Slaty cleavage, which shows itself in both these
groups on the east, becomes more marked on the west, until they
might both be spoken of as clay-slate formations.
   West of Cork Harbour the Carboniferous Slate is covered in one
or two places by patches of black slate, which Mr. Jukes believes
to be the lower part of the Irish Coal-measures, resting conformably
on the Carboniferous Slate, with no very definite boundary between
the two, as in North Devon.      He believes, accordingly, that as the
Carboniferous slate expands towards the west, the limestone dies
away from below upwards, and that the beds which are the base of
the limestone at Ballea, a few miles west of Cork Harbour, are on
the same horizon as the Upper Limestone beds of Waterford, even
these uppermost beds disappearing a little further west.  He there
fore looks on the Carboniferous Slate, especially in     upper part,            its
 asbeing contemporaneous with the Carboniferous Limestone.       He
believes that there      regular consecutive series from the Old Red
                              is
                              a
Sandstone into the Coal-measures, through the Carboniferous Lime
stone   inone area, and through the Carboniferous Slate     the other.           in
   In North Devon the author considered the dark slates and sand
stones which strike from Baggy Point and Croyde Bay by Marwood
and Barnstaple       Dulverton, identical with parts
                         to                              the Carboni        of
ferous slate    Ireland; and red and variegated sandstones and slates,
               of
rising out    the northward from underneath the grey series, iden
              to
tical in character with the Irish Old Red Sandstone.      On recent                    a
visit, however,         to
                 the north coast    Lynton, Ilfracombe, and Morte
                                                  at
hoe, he found that those beds also were identical    character with        in
parts   ofthe Carboniferous slate, and contained some             the same       of
fossils  as  are found       Ireland and
                                  in        the Barnstaple district, each
                                                       in
district having fossils not found                in
                                        the others.
   These beds,          in
                     the absence     any reason
                                             of       suspect the contrary,
                                                                 to
would    be judged      pass under that Old Red Sandstone.
                             to                                     Relying,
however, on the conclusions formed            Ireland, Mr. Jukes believes
                                                       in
that the central band of Old Red Sandstone must be cut off towards
the north by great longitudinal fault, with
                   a                                    downthrow a      the               to
north   of some 4000 feet. Mr. Jukes pointed out that this hypo
thesis would        do
                    away with the necessity        assigning the enormous
                                                            of
thickness     tothe North Devon rocks which the ordinary hypothesis
requires.
   After discussing        general terms the objections that may
                                  in                                                            be
urged against the hypothesis, especially the palaeontological ones,
 he ventured      propose that geologists should
                   to                                    longer include the
                                                                      no
Old Red Sandstone       among   the Devonian   beds,  but confine the term

tween the top       of

measures.      Taking their wide range over the world into account,
he  would even regard the Devonian rocks and fossils               the most       as

   The following communications were read:—
    l. “On the Fossil British Oxen.—Part I. Bos Urus, Caesar.” By
W. Boyd Dawkins, Esq., M.A., F.G.S.
    The problem of the origin of our domestic races of cattle was
considered by the author to be capable of solution only after a care
ful examination of each of the three European fossil species of Ox,
namely, Bos Urus of Caesar, B. longifrons of Owen, and B. Bison of
Pliny.    In this paper he began the inquiry with Bos Urus, Caesar,
being the Bos primigenius of Bojanus; and he arrived at the con
clusion that between this species and Bos Taurus, or the common
Ox, there is no difference of specific value, though the difference in
size and some other characters of minor value render the bones of
the two varieties capable of recognition. After giving the synonymy
of Bos Urus in some detail, and measurements of the different bones
as represented by specimens from a number of localities, Mr. Boyd
Dawkins described the range of the species in space and time, show
ing that it coexisted in Britain with the Mammoth, Rhinoceros lepto
rhinus, R. megarhinus, and R. tichorhinus, and was associated with
Elephas antiquus, Felis spelaea, Ursus spelaeus, U. Arctos, Bos priscus,
Megaceros Hibernicus, Cervus Elaphus, C. Tarandus, Equus fossilis,
 &c., and held its ground during the Prehistoric period, after most
 of these animals had become extinct or retreated from this country.
The precise date of its extinction in Britain was stated to be
 somewhat uncertain, although the author inclined to the belief that
 it existed in the wild state as late as the middle of the 12th century;
 while on the continent it seems probable that it lingered until the
 16th century.     The author then endeavoured to explain its gradual
 diminution in size by the progressive encroachment of cultivation on
 its old haunts; and in conclusion stated his belief that at least the
 larger cattle of Western Europe are the descendants'of the Bos Urus,
 modified in many respects by restricted range, but still more by the
 domination   of man.

 in the neighbourhood of the - Kameni Islands.” By Commander G.
 Tryon.
     Åºuled account was here given of the formation of the new
 island, named “Aphroessa” by the Greek Commissioners.            It was
 stated to be 100 yards long by 50 wide, and to be daily increasing
 in size. Volcanic eruptions had taken place in two localities, one
 in the new island, and the other in what was called Mineral Creek,
 which is about two-fifths of a mile distant, and which had been com
 pletely filled up with lava. Considerable concussions were experi
 enced at Patras and other parts of Greece, which were by some
 attributed to an earthquake, and by others to volcanic explosions;
 but with these exceptions no earthquake had attended the eruptions
  or the formation of the island.
     3. “Note on the Junction of the Thanet Sand and the Chalk,

480                        Geological   Society:-
and of the Sandgate Beds and Kentish Rag.”          By T. M'Kenny
Hughes, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
   At the bottom of the Thanet Sand there is always a bed of green
coated flints in a green and rust-brown clayey sand, which the
author is of opinion was derived from the decomposition of the
chalk by the percolation of carbonated water after the deposition
of the Thanet Sand, as none of the flints are water-worn, and only
chalk-fossils have been found in the bed.
   At the base of the Sandgate Beds, and resting on rubbly Kentish
rag, there is generally a bed of green sand; it may be seen in the
quarries near Maidstone, where it occupies furrows of the nature of
pipes.   Mr. Hughes endeavoured to show that this bed has been
derived from the decomposition of the Rag after the deposition
of the brick-earth, and that the rubbly limestone below it is the
same, in process of decomposition.    He remarked in conclusion that
conformabilities or uncomformabilities of beds must not be inferred
from an examination of the line of junction only, as that may have
been very much modified after the deposition of the newer formation.
  4. “On the Lower London Tertiaries of Kent.” By W. Whit
aker, Esq., B.A., F.G.S.
  This paper gave the general results of the Geological Survey
work in the Tertiary district of Kent, chiefly by the author, who
expressed his agreement with Mr. Prestwich's paper, except in a few
matters of mere detail.           -
  Five different members of the Thanet Beds were distinguished,
the only constant one being the “base-bed,” the possible formation
of which, after the deposition of the sands, &c. above, worked out
in detail by Mr. Hughes, had occurred also to the author. It was
shown that the fine Thanet Sand of West Kent was replaced east
ward by beds of fossiliferous sandy marl and sand, which come on in
succession above it.
   Of the overlying Woolwich Beds, only the lower part is present
in the eastern part of the county, the middle (the estuarine shell
beds) and upper        parts being limited to the western       and central
districts.
  The sands of East Kent which Mr. Prestwich had somewhat
doubtfully classed with the basement bed of the London Clay and
the pebble-beds of West Kent, part of which had been classed
with the Woolwich series and part with the basement bed, the
author had been led to look upon as a distinct division, to which he
gave the name “Oldhaven Beds,” and which are separable alike
from the London Clay above and from the Woolwich Beds below.
   The basement bed of the London Clay, in the limited sense in
 which it is understood by the author, changes       its
                                                   structure accord
ing   tothat of the underlying beds.
   The author corrected some mistakes that had been made               in   a
paper printed     inthe Society's Journal,    in
                                              which an undoubted
Eocene-bed near Chislet was classed with the Crag,         on
                                                         the strength
of its fossils, many      of
                          which     he
                                     believed   have been wrongly
                                                to
named.
  It  was then pointed out that the Woolwich and Reading series

         On the Brown Cannel Coal-seams at Colley Creek.               481
was known to be transgressive over the underlying Thanet Beds, and
it was shown that the Oldhaven Beds were transgressive over both,
so that outliers of the last might rest at once on the Chalk; and
from this the author thought that, in the absence of good palaeon
tological evidence, the occurrence of the isolated patches of sand on
the North Downs, which Mr. Prestwich had classed with the Crag,
might be explained by the geological structure of the older Ter
tiaries, although he did not attempt to say that they belonged to
that series: should a more decided opinion be given on their fossils,
he was quite willing to take Mr. Prestwich's view.
  April 11.-Warington W. Smyth, Esq., President, in        the Chair.
  The following communications were read:—
  1. “On the Brown Cannel or Petroleum Coal-seams at Colley
Creek, New South Wales.”     By William Keene, Esq., F.G.S.
  In this paper the author described the geological position of the
Brown Cannel or Petroleum-coal of Colley Creek, Liverpool Plains.
From an examination of the rocks, he stated that he had been able
to determine that this Cannel is below the Coal-seams worked in
the Newcastle coal-field. It appeared to form the very base of the
Coal-measures, and to be in such close contact with the Porphyries,
that these latter seemed mixed up with the lower portion of the
Cannel Coal. There are two parallel seams of workable thickness,
which are tilted at a high angle, and run north and south.    In ap
pearance the specimens are identical with the Brown Cannels from
Hartley, and are but little different from the Boghead coal of
Scotland.
   At Scone, near the Kingdon Ponds, a section was noticed in
which the marine fossiliferous bed is proved to overlie the coal
seams, affording, as the author remarks, conclusive testimony as to
the high antiquity of the Coal-beds.
   2. “On the Occurrence and Geological Position of Oil-bearing
Deposits in New South Wales.” By the Rev. W. B. Clarke, M.A.
F.G.S.
  The author first described the oil-producing schists and cannels
of New South Wales as they exist at Colley Creek, at the head of
the Cordeaux river (Illawarra shales), at various places in the Wol
londilly and Nattai valleys, at Reedy Creek (Hartley Cannel),
Stony Creek, and elsewhere; as well as a substance resembling
“Bog-butter,” occurring at Bournda, and probably of very recent
date.   Respecting the Colley Creek Cannel described in the pre
vious  paper, Mr. Clarke observed that he saw no porphyry near               it,
but that seam
         a         ormass     the Cannel, which here contains nume
                             of
rous scarcely rounded    grains     quartz, was passed through
                                    of                            inthe
midst of a  series oflayers    black, partly unctuous clay, which also
                               of
contained many similar quartz-grains; these grains gave     tothe clay
  porphyritic aspect,   so          by
                                     sight alone one might   be
                                                                             at to
a                           that                                led
consider them  a   decomposed porphyry. The chief conclusions
which the author arrived were, (1) that, with the exception
                                                                  on in of
                                                                    the
Stony Creek Cannel,      all the oil-producing deposits occur       the
Upper Coal-measures, and that the Cannel       of  Stony Creek,     the

river Hunter, occurs in the Lower Coal-measures, which are above
the Lower Marine beds with Trilobites, below which again are nu
merous fossiliferous beds before the porphyry is reached; and (2)
that the Cannel belongs to beds in which Glossopteris occurs, and
therefore may be a slight additional evidence of their antiquity, as
it is an analogue of the “Bog Head” Cannel of Scotland.
    3. “Remarks on the Copper mines of the State of Michigan.”
By H. Bauerman, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author described briefly the different conditions under which
native copper is found in the trappean belt of the Upper Peninsula
of Michigan, on Lake Superior. The district in question is a
narrow strip of ground about 140 miles long, and from 2 to 6 miles
in breadth, made up of alternations of compact and vesicular traps,
with subordinate beds of columnar and crystalline greenstones, con
formably interbedded with sandstones and conglomerates.              Three
different classes of deposits are known,-namely, transverse or fissure
lodes in the northern district; cupriferous amygdaloids and conglo
merates following the strike, in the central or Portage district; and
irregular concretionary lodes, also parallel to the bedding, in the
southern or Antonagon district.        In the fissure-veins copper occurs
either spotted through the vein-stuff, or concentrated in compara
tively smooth plates, or lenticular masses, of all sizes up to 500
tons.     In the Antonagon lodes the masses are also large, but of
much more irregular forms.         In the Portage district, on the other
hand, only small masses are found, the great production of the mines
of this region being derived from the finely divided spots and grains
 interspersed through the amygdaloids and conglomerates.
    After giving details of the phenomena observed in the lodes of
particular mines, and a list of the principal alternations of minerals,
 chiefly zeolites with quartz, native copper, and calcite, the latter
mineral being both newer and older than the copper, the author
proceeded to notice the various hypotheses that may be framed for
 elucidating the occurrence of native copper in the Lake Superior
 traps.    Two principal sources were indicated—the first on the sup
 position that protoxide of copper may have originally formed part of
 the felspathic component of the trap, or that the same rock may
have contained sulphuretted compounds of copper mechanically in
 termixed; while according to the second view the overlying sand
 stones may have contained small quantities of copper-bearing
 minerals, in a similar manner to the Kupferschiefer and other Per
 mian and Triassic rocks in Europe.        Supposing the trappean rocks
 to have been percolated by solutions carrying the products of the
 alteration of such minerals, it was suggested that the reduction to
 the
      metallic state was mainly produced by the action of substances
 containing protoxides of iron, which by higher oxidation have given
 rise to the dark-red colour and the earthy ochreous substances found
in the vein-matter. The causes producing the metalliferous de
posits in the trap were stated to have evidently acted throughout
the whole system; and the absence of copper from the compact beds
is probably rather due to the absence of cavities    fit  for the reception
of  such   masses, thanto any   differencein  chemical   composition.

   ON THE INFLUENCE OF THE EIECTRO-NEGATIVE ELEMENTS
             UPON THE SPECTRA OF THE METALS.
D'AºN     has published an interesting paper upon the influence of
  chlorine, bromine,iodine, and fluorine upon the spectra of various
elements,         and has confirmed        and extended Mitscherlich's results.
The memoir is preceded by a good historical introduction, and
is illustrated by four excellent figures of spectra. The author sums
up his results as follows:—
   The chlorides of certain metals which are very rapidly decomposed
in the gas-flame are at least partially volatilized in a chloridizing
flame, and are therefore capable of producing spectra.    These spectra
in general  differ from those which are observed with the oxides of the
same metals in an oxidizing flame.
   The chloride, bromide, iodide, and fluoride of the same metal placed
in an oxidizing flame may give rise to bright lines, the position of
which is different according to the salt examined.      These lines, the
duration of which is very variable, are always accompanied by the
spectrum which we obtain with the oxide.
   Since the lines which appear with the chlorides belong to spectra
which characterize these salts when volatilized in a chloridizing flame,
it is proper to regard the new rays which are presented by the
bromides, iodides, and fluorides as forming part of the spectra which
these compounds would give in flames which do not act upon them.
Hence it follows, that if it were possible to make with these salts
experiments similar to those made with the chlorides, we should
have for the same element, barium for instance, five different spectra.
   Diacon considers the influence of the electro-negative element upon
the spectrum to be placed beyond a doubt by his experiments, as
well as by Mitscherlich's. The spectra given by Bunsen and Kirchhoff
for the alkaline earthy metals are mixtures of the spectra which are
obtained when the oxide is ignited in an oxidizing flame, and those
obtained by igniting the chlorides in a chloridizing flame.      The
spectra attributed by Mitscherlich to the chlorides are also in part
mixtures of the same spectra. In the first case, however, the spectra
of the oxides predominate, and in the second those of the chlorides.

IT     is now a universally acknowledged fact that muscular ac
        tion is brought about by chemical changes alone; and
the   proposition,    that it is by processes of oxidation that the mus
cles are rendered capable of performing work, would be just as
little likely to meet with contradiction.            But       are not agreed          all

appear       think that the oxidation

-486               Drs. A. Fick and        J. Wislicenus           on the
specially the oxidation of albuminous compounds which produces
muscular force. It is quite possible that the non-nitrogenous
substances in muscle play the part of combustibles, although
but a small quantity of those substances is to be found in muscle
at any particular moment. It is even conceivable that these
compounds pass, as it were, through the muscle in a rapid stream,
each particle which enters it being immediately oxidized and
carried away again.              If
                           we examine this supposition more closely,
we find that, even from the most general points of view, there
is much to be said for the hypothesis that non-nitrogenous
compounds form the fuel or oxidizable materials in the muscles.
   Liebig long ago pointed out that the non-nitrogenous organic
compounds of the food, particularly the hydrates of carbon and
the fats, are the sources of heat. He, indeed, could hardly have
thought of fuel generating mechanical power, chiefly because
our present problem was far beyond the chemists and physiolo
gists of that time.    But from the point to which science has at
present attained, if once a certain group of materials of food
are found to be heat-producers, it is easy to conceive the derivation
from the oxidation of these substances, not merely of heat, but
also of the mechanical work of the organism, since, as is now well
known, heat and mechanical work are only two manifestations
of the same force. In fact it would be very strange                     the      if,     in
animal economy, one particular group                         of
                                                  food-constituents was

we chose the ascent of a mountain-peak, the height of which
was known.      We preferred the mountain to a treadmill, not
merely because the ascent is a more entertaining employment,
but chiefly for the reason that we had no suitable treadmill at our
disposition.   Of the numerous peaks of the Swiss Alps, the one
most suitable for our purpose appeared to be the Faulhorn, near
the lake of Brienz, in the Bernese Oberland.    It was necessary
that the mountain which was to serve for our  experiment  should
be as high as possible, and nevertheless should permit of our
passing a night on                        its
                       summit under tolerably normal circum

the work urine.    Again, the amount of urine secreted between 20
minutes past 1    and 7 in the evening was determined; this we
will call simply  the after-work urine. During this time we re
mained, for the   most part, in the house without any muscular
exertion worth    mentioning.   After 7 o'clock a plentiful meal,
consisting chiefly of meat, was taken, and lastly the urine ex
creted during the night spent in the hotel of the Faulhorn (that
is to say, from 7 o'clock in the evening of the 30th till half
past 5 in the morning of the 31st of August) was measured and
again designated night urine. Arrived at the hotel on the sum
mit of the Faulhorn, determinations of the quantity of urea in
the specimen of the night urine from the 29th to the 30th, and
of the work urine excreted between half-past 5 in the morning
and 20 minutes past 1, shortly after the end of the ascent, were
proceeded with. The method followed was precisely that given
by Neubauer for absolute determinations of urea.
   Phosphoric and sulphuric acids were first precipitated from
40 cubic centims. of urine by 20 cubic centims. of solution of
baryta, which quantity was proved to be sufficient; and 15 cubic
centims. of the filtrate (=10 cubic centims. of urine) were
employed for the determination of chlorine by Liebig’s method,
with a solution of nitrate of mercury of which 1 cubic centim.
corresponded to 0-01 grim. of common salt.          From 30 cubic
centims. of the filtrate the chlorine was then precipitated with
the exact amount of silver solution necessary, as indicated by the
amount of mercury solution previously employed. A portion of
the filtrate (= to 5 cubic centims. of urine) was then employed
in making an approximative determination of the amount of
urea, and with another portion (= the 10 cubic centims. of
urine) an exact determination of urea was made with the neces
sary mercury solution (1 cubic centim. =0.01 grim. of urea).
These operations were performed with every possible precaution.
   On the morning of the 30th of August we made similar deter
minations of the after-work urine of the preceding day, collected
between 20 minutes past 1 P.M. and 7 o'clock in the evening.
A specimen of each kind of urine was also sealed up in a per
fectly filled and well-corked and sealed bottle, in order that on
our return to Zurich the yet more important determination of
the absolute quantity of nitrogen might be undertaken ; the
same thing was done with the second night urine, collected and
measured between 7 o'clock in the evening of the 30th of August,
and 6 o'clock in the morning of the 31st; but the quantity of
urea in this, owing to want of time, was not determined. The
chlorine and urea determinations gave the following results:—
   I. Night urine from the 29th to the 30th of August. In both
cases coloured light yellow, perfectly clear, decided acid reaction.

     A glance at these Tables furnishes a new testimony to the
fact, which has often been before experimentally proved, that
muscular exertion does not notably increase the excretion of
nitrogen through the urine.            It declined in our experiment
tolerably regularly from the 29th of August till the evening
of the 30thº, evidently in consequence of abstinence from food
containing nitrogen.       In the night of the 30th to the 31st, in
spite of the plentiful meal of albuminous food on the evening
of the 30th, the secretion of nitrogen was less than on the pre
ceding night.      The reason of this perhaps was that during
abstinence the secretion of nitrogen (never entirely discontinued)
was carried on at the expense of tissues, and now these tissues
had first of             all         be
                         repaired. We will not pursue such consi
                               to
derations   further,  but will apply our figures       other conclusions.                to

494                 Drs. A. Fick and                      J. Wislicenus           on the
end of the time of work any considerable quantity of the nitro
genous products of decomposition remained in the body, we
might reply that at least an equal quantity of such products
must have been in the body at the commencement of the time
of work.
   We will not, however, insist upon this point; nay, we will even
concede to the opponents of our hypothesis that there was an ex
ceptionally large quantity of the peculiar nitrogenous products of
muscular action retained in the body. We will also not availour
selves of the consideration that this curious phenomenon, if it
really existed, would only indicate that the products of decompo
sition resulting from muscular action were not so highly oxidized
as ordinarily, and that therefore comparatively little heat was libe
rated during their formation. We will, as we have said, put aside
all these considerations; but      may, without danger   we  meeting                                of

of protein  substances appeared in the urine as the surplus
which  might  possibly have been retained after work, over and
above that normally contained in the tissues. This being
granted, we have the data for further calculations, in the total
amount of nitrogen contained in the work urine and after-work
urine (see page 492). This is for Fick 38:28 grims., and for
Wislicenus 37-00 grms. of decomposed albumen. To the first
of these two figures we may apply a slight correction. For ob
vious reasons, we were compelled to measure the night urine
at our hotel at Interlaken at 10 minutes past 5.         But the
work really began two hours later, after one hour passed on the
steamboat, and another spent over breakfast at Iseltwald ; there
fore the urine secreted during these two hours ought not properly
to have been reckoned with the work urine.         In the case of
one of   us, however  (Fick), this error may be in some measure
repaired; just before the ascent he had discharged a quantity of
urine into the vessel destined to receive the work urine. This
quantity could not indeed be measured, because the graduated
apparatus had been packed up at Interlaken, but, by the eye, it
must have been at least as much as 20 cubic centims.        If we
assume that this quantity of urine contained the same propor
tion of nitrogen as the work urine, it would correspond to
l'll  grim. of albumen, which we ought without doubt to deduct
from the number 38-28.        We thus obtain for the greatest pos
sible quantity   of albumen oxidized in Fick's body during the
ascent 37.17      grns.
   The question now arises, what quantity of heat is generated
when 37.17 and 37.00 grims. of albumen are respectively burnt
to the products in which their constituent elements leave the
human body through the lungs and kidneys : At present, unfor
tunately, there are not the experimental data required to give an
accurate answer to this important question; for neither the heat
of combustion of albumen nor of the nitrogenous residue of
albumen is known.       We are able, however, to assign, a limit
which the    quantity  of heat in question will not overstep.  In
fact it is quite certain that the amount of heat which 1 grim. of
albumen will give when completely burnt must be less than the
amount of heat which would be obtained if the combustible ele
ments contained in a gramme of albumen were burnt separately;
that   is,   other words, the heat
             in                           of
                                       combustion      albumen   of        is
less than that        of
                   mixture         of
                              the elements     the same propor

tions, and not     in a
                   combination with oxygen. Now the latter
number may        easily calculated;
                    be                     only requisite
                                                it   is       de      to
 termine how much heat would          produced
                                           be       the combus  by

496              Drs. A. Fick and    J. Wislicenus       on the
known to be set free in the combustion of albumen.      Very                pro
 bably also nitrogen has no heat of combustion at  all; that is to
say, in the combination of an atom of nitrogen with oxygen
there is not so much heat developed as is consumed in the se
paration of the molecules of oxygen into the atoms of which
they are composed.    A gramme of albumen contains 0.535 grim.
of carbon,  which,  computed  at the highest rate (8080) for the
heat of combustion of carbon, gives 4:32 units of heat.       For
the combustion of the 0.07   grim.  of hydrogen  contained in 1
grm. of albumen, putting 34,462 for the heat of combustion
of this element, there are 2.41 units of heat; altogether for
1 grim.   of albumen 6-73 units of heat. The true heat of com
 bustion of a gramme of albumen is therefore in any case con
 siderably less than this number; and still smaller must the
 amount of heat be which is liberated by the imperfect oxidation
of a gramme of albumen as it actually occurs in the human
body.     Conceding this point to our opponents, and making the
almost absurd assumption that 6-73 units of heat are produced
                           l
by the consumption of grim. of albumen in the human body;
then there would arise from the consumption of albumen, in the
case of Fick, 37.17 x 6'73=250, and in that of Wislicenus
37:00 x 6'73=249 units of heat, available for the muscular work
done in ascending the mountain.           Expressed in units of work,
this  gives for Fick  106,250,   and for Wislicenus 105,825 metre -
kilogrammes.
    Let us now inquire how much work was really done by our
muscles. One item necessary for the reply is already at hand,
viz. the height of the summit of the Faulhorn above the level of
the lake of Brienz multiplied by the weight of the body; the
former reckoned in metres, the latter in kilogrammes.             The
weight of the body with the equipments (hat, clothes, stick)
amounted to 66 kilogrammes in Fick's case, and 76 in Wisli
cenus’s.    The height of the Faulhorn above the level of the
lake of Brienz     is,
                     according  to  trigonometric measurements, ex
actly 1956 metres.        Therefore Fick performed 129,096 and
Wislicenus 148,656 metre-kilogrammes
                                                 in of
                                                 muscular work.
   The   question we   putat   the outset   is    this manner defini
tively answered.      The burning     of protein substances cannot           be
the only source    of muscular power; for         we
                                                  have here two cases
in   which men   performed    more measurable muscular work than
the equivalent   of the amount  of   heat, which, taken      most ab
                                                                  at
                                                                   a
surdly high figure, could  be  calculated   toresult from the burning
we of
     the albumen.     But our proof becomes far stronger when
    consider that  a  much greater amount        of
                                                 heat must have been
given forth   by  the  force-producing    chemical processes than           is
equivalent  to  the measurable external work performed.            the In

muscles as if work were being performed which did not undergo
this transformation.      In order to make this point yet clearer, we
may take into consideration that the whole work of the ascent
only existed temporarily as work.            On the following day the
result was   reversed;   “our bodies    approached    the centre of the
earth by as much as they had receded from it the day before,
and, in consequence, on the second day an amount of heat was
liberated equal to the amount of work previously performed.
The two parts of the action, which in this case were performed
on two separate days, take place in walking on level ground in
the space of a footstep.
   Let us observe, besides, that in an ascent it is not only those
muscles of the leg specially devoted to climbing which are ex
erted, the arms, head, and trunk are continually in motion. For
 allthese movements force-generating processes are necessary, the
result     which cannot, however, figure
              of                                  our total     work, butin               of

by the more rapid firing necessary for working, but much more
coal would be burnt when it was at work than when it was
standing idle.     We therefore conclude that since the burning
of albumen cannot be the only source of muscular power, it is
not in any way concerned in        production; and     its

have enormous strength, there are several whose nourishment
contains very little albumen, but,                           on

We will here quote a remarkable fact bearing upon our theory,
which was lately communicated to us by Dr. Piccard.         The
chamois-hunters of western Switzerland are accustomed, when
starting on long and fatiguing expeditions, to take with them as
provisions nothing but bacon-fat and sugar, because, as they
say, these substances are more nourishing than meat.          What
they mean by this expression       that  they      is,
                                               have learnt       ex                              by
perience that,          in
                 the form     fat and sugar, they can most con
                                           of
veniently carry with them      rich provision
                                            a      force-producing        of
oxidizable matter. With   regard      this  point,   we can assert,
                                                         to
from our own experience     the ascent      the Faulhorn, that
                                           in                   of                                     in
spite   of
         the amount     work and the abstinence for thirty-one
                                   of
hours from albuminous   food,  we neither           felt   the least of   us         in
exhausted. This could hardly have been the case        our muscular            if
force had not been sustained                         by
                                    the non-nitrogenous food                                           of

   Our experience is therefore against a decrease of vapour pro
ducing a decrease of lines in this region, but not perhaps against
a decrease of vapour producing a diminution in the intensity of
the group of lines near the most refrangible D line. This is the
group that Mr. Cooke has found to vanish altogether when the
amount of vapour is small. We have never found them to vanish,
but we have observed a change of intensity, which may perhaps
be due to vapour.
     Ishall only make one further remark. An observation of the
spectrum of ignited sodium (made,                         I
                                         think, in the presence of
Mr. Huggins) discovered the existence of at least two sodium
lines between the two D lines.      In this region, therefore, there
are at least four lines due to sodium; and it might be natural to
suppose that the absorption lines due to the presence of sodium
vapour in the sun's atmosphere should be at least four in num
ber for the same region.       Besides these there is probably a
nickel  line;  so that on these grounds I should hesitate in belie
ving that Mr. Cooke's fig. 1, in which there are only three lines
in all, namely the two D lines and one intervening line, is the ulti
mate representation of this region by a very powerful instrument.

   After the          oil

tube had the well-known smell of the lower members of the fatty
acid series, and after being diluted with water were distilled, and
gave an acid distillate.      This distillate was redistilled, and the
distillate converted into a baryta-salt.      The baryta-salt was care
fully tested for formiates, and contained none.
    It was dried at 110° C. and analyzed.
    I. 3922 grim. of baryta-salt was ignited, and evolved abun
dance of organic matter, leaving .2804 grim. carbonate of baryta.
Therefore Ba per cent. =49.77.
    II. 6266 grim. was precipitated with dilute sulphuric acid;
and the resulting sulphate of baryta weighed 5295 grim. There
fore Ba per cent. =4974.
    These numbers are intermediate between those required by
propionate and acetate of baryta—a result which clearly shows
that the liquid is broken up on oxidation, and, since neither car
bonic acid nor formic acid is produced, indicates pretty clearly
that the results of the oxidation are propionic and acetic acids.
    Confirmation of this fact was obtained by applying Liebig’s
 method of fractional saturation to the mixed acid. Some of the
 acid was partially saturated with carbonate of soda and distilled,
 and the distillate made into a baryta-salt.
    2066 grm. of this baryta-salt gave 1728 grim. of sulphate
                      of Ba

the product obtained from carbonic oxide and sodium-ethyle                      is
identical with normal propione.

  You will perhaps remember that some two years ago sent                                     I
you some original observations made   the Flagstaff Obser      at

lowing remarks.
   (l) The observations were made                         at   all   times     the day and
                                                                                of

                               of                      relative                           of
humidity were observed              by
                          August's psychrometer, continually
checked, however,              by
                       Döbereiner-Regnault's aspirator hygro

                                and Terrestrial Radiation.                        511
meter. The reductions were effected by Regnault's Tables, the
thermometers being Kew standards.
    (3) The radiation-instrument consisted of a spirit minimum
thermometer of Kew, the bulb of which was placed and carefully
adjusted in the focus of a parabolic reflector nicely polished
and silvered, 6-4 inches wide and 2-4 inches deep*.      This re
flector was put in a box filled with cotton and placed in a little
house, keeping out the rays of the sun, but in such a manner
that the zenith over the instrument remained perfectly free for
a space of some 38°.     The focus of the reflector was about 1%
feet above the surrounding   ground (see introduction to “Results,’
                                                    \

    (4) The psychrometer was
placed close to this radiation
apparatus; and in order to
have a control, a therinome
ter was placed within the little
house (seeannexed figure), the
same being frequently com
pared with the Kew standard.
     (5) Table       I.     contains     in
its first column the number
of single simultaneous obser
vations, the second column
shows the mean pressure of
aqueous vapour, the next the meantemperature of the air, and the
last the mean difference between temperature of air and radia
tion, obtained by the instruments described. The results have
been arranged according to the value of the aqueous tension.
  (6) Table         II. shows
                         the relation between the degree of relative
humidity of          air
                   and the radiation-difference.   For every single
set      observations the relative humidity was computed.

effect that the temperature of the surrounding air does not sen
sibly influence the difference of temperature between the ra
diating body and the temperature of the air, thought one might            I
be inclined to suspect undue radiation influencing     the reading
of the  parabolic  thermometer,   and I took for this reason the
trouble of classifying the observations merely according to tem
perature of the air.
                                       I
   The results at which arrive may be summed up in the fol
lowing lines:–
   (a) The absolute quantity of aqueous vapour in the air is in itself
 alone not sufficient as a criterion for the degree of radiation; or
 if it should be otherwise, the instrument used for the observa
 tions is not sufficiently delicate to show the degree of influence.

 516               Mr. W. Huggins and Dr. W. A. Miller                         on the
 unbroken spectrum containing rays of light of every refrangibility
within the portion of the spectrum which is visible. As this
condition of the light is connected with the state of solidity or
liquidity, and not with the chemical nature of the body, it is
highly probable that the light when first emitted from the pho
tosphere, or light-giving surface of the sun and of the stars,
would be in all cases identical.
   The source of the difference of colour, therefore, is to be sought
in the difference of the constituents of the investing atmospheres”.
The atmosphere of each star must vary in nature as the consti
 tuents of the star vary; and observation has shown that the stars
 do differ from the sun and from each other in respect of the ele
 ments of which they consist. The light of each star therefore
 will be diminished by the loss of those rays which correspond in
 refrangibility to the bright lines which the constituents of each
 atmosphere would, in the incandescent state, be capable of emit
 ting. In proportion as these dark lines preponderate in parti
 cular parts of the spectrum, so will the colours in which they
occur be weaker; and consequently the colours of other refrangi
bilities will predominate.
    Of this the spectrum of a Orionis affords a good example.
The green and blue parts of the spectrum are comparatively dark,
from the numerous and close groups of dark lines.                  In the
orange they are less strong.       Hence it    might  be anticipated  that
the light of the star would be characterized by “an orange
tinge,” as noted by Smyth.         S Pegasi is described by Smyth as
“deep yellow;” and the appearance exhibited by                  spectrum,       its
which closely resembles that            Orionis, though much fainter,

that the length of the stellar atmosphere through which the
light passes is less, relatively to the intensity of radiation from
the photosphere, and so is insufficient to produce lines of the
same degree of blackness as would be produced if the atmosphere
 were denser.       The great intensity, however, of the light of Sirius

which the colour of the star was blue, was remarkable for the
faintness of the orange and yellow portions, compared with the
rest of the spectrum. The diminished brightness of these parts
appears to be produced by several groups of closely set fine lines,
while towards the more refrangible limit of the spectrum a few
strong lines separated by considerable intervals are seen.

its spectrum,       isdifficult and fatiguing

   21. These spectrum observations are not without interest also
when viewed in connexion with the nebular hypothesis of the cos

space,          or             them which are bright     us, were once

                                     the nebulous material must have
differed       at

proportions          of
                  similar materials from the mass around.         can                                 It

the association       the different elements: we find, for example,

the same star.
  If     we    may       so   say, there seems          to    be   some analogy between this
irregular distribution               of

                              in             the earth’s crust are      of
distributed.  Upon the earth there are certain very generally
diffused elements, such       oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, silicon,
                                          as
iron, aluminium, and calcium, which occur           parts; whilst            in        all

reasoning from analogy to those parts of the universe which are

   Upon the earth we find that the innumerable individual re

trial activity, are not met by a plan of operation distinct for each,
but are effected in connexion with the special modifications of a
general method embracing a wide range of analogous phenomena.

which we know to be indispensable to the existence of living           or
ganisms such as those with which we are acquainted. On the
whole we believe that the foregoing spectrum observations on
the stars contribute something towards an experimental basis on
which a conclusion, hitherto but a pure speculation, may rest,
viz. that at least the brighter stars are, like our sun, upholding
and energizing centres of systems of worlds adapted to be the
abode of living beings.

   The apparatus employed was that of which a description was
given at page 415.   A second eyepiece was used in these obser
vations, having a magnifying-power of nine diameters. For the
greater part of the following observations on the nebulae, the
cylindrical lens is not necessary, and was removed from the                                          in

A planetary nebula; very bright; pretty small; suddenly
brighter in the middle, very small nucleus.]    In Draco.
   On August   29, 1864,             I
                           directed the telescope armed with the
 spectrum-apparatus to this nebula. At first               suspected some  I
 derangement of the instrument had taken place; for no spec
 trum was seen, but only a short line of light perpendicular to
 the direction of dispersion.                I
                                        then found that the light of this
 nebula, unlike any other ex-terrestrial light which had yet been
 subjected by me to prismatic analysis, was not composed of light
 of different refrangibilities, and therefore could not form a spec
 trum.    A great part of the light from this nebula is monochro
matic, and after passing through the prisms remains concentrated
in a bright line occupying in the instrument the position of that
part of the spectrum to which                    its
                                           light corresponds       refrangi           in

which nearly the whole of the light from the nebula is concen
trated.

the 6-feet instrument, because I have never seen it under favourable cir
cumstances: the opportunities of observing it well on the meridian are
comparatively rare, owing to twilight.     It was observed seven times in

528                   Mr. W. Huggins              on the Spectra
  Minute points of light have been observed in this nebula by
Lord Rosse, Otto Struve, and others; the spectra of these bright
points, especially if continuous like those of stars, are doubtless
invisible from excessive faintness.
   By suitable movements given to the telescope, different por
tions of the image of the nebula formed in the telescope were
caused successively to fall upon the opening of the slit, which
was about To inch by gºo inch.         This method of observation
showed that the light from different parts of the nebula is iden
tical in refrangibility, and varies alone in degree of intensity +.
   In addition to these objects the following were also observed :—
  [No. 4294. 92 M. R.A. 17h 12m 56°-9. N.P.D.46°43' 31"-2.]
In Hercules. Very bright globular cluster of stars. The bright
central portion was brought upon the slit. A faint spectrum
similar to that of a star.           The light could be traced from between
C and D to about G.
   Too faint for the observation of lines of absorption.
   [No. 4244. 50 H. IV. R.A. 16h 43m 68.4. N.P.D. 42°8'38".8.
Very bright; large; round..] In Hercules.           The spectrum
similar to that of a faint star. No indication of  bright lines.
   [No. 116. 50 h. 31 M. R.A.0h 35m 3-9. N.P.D.49°29'45".7.]
The brightest part of the great nebula in Andromeda was brought
upon the slit.
   The spectrum could be traced from about D to F. The light
appeared to cease very abruptly in the orange; this may be due
to the smaller luminosity of this part of the spectrum.     No in
dication of the bright   lines.
   [No. 117. 51 h. 32 M. R.A.. Oh 35m 5s 3. N.P.D. 49°54/120.7.

                                                 -

   This small but very bright companion of the great nebula in
Andromeda presents a spectrum apparently exactly similar to
that of 31 M.           -
   The  spectrum   appears    to end abruptly in the orange, and,

nebula in Orion is resolved by the prism into three bright lines.-Proceed
ings of the Royal Society, vol. xiv. p. 39.
   During 1865 he discovered that the nebulae which follow have similar
spectra, consisting of one, two, or three bright lines, in addition to which,
in the case of some of them, a continuous spectrum was visible.

ceive that I have omitted to consider the effect of the drain upon
the ocean which the formation of Mr. Croll’s ice-sheet would
cause.      My calculation of the amount of rise in the level of the
ocean    in passing from the equator to northern latitudes may be
all   right. But the drain upon the ocean would reduce the level
so    as   make my starting-point
           to                          (the equator) much lower,                                          I
conceive  (probably 2000   feet), than the rise caused   the attrac                      by
tion    the ice-sheet. This therefore most materially affects the
       of

the known conclusions as to the attractions of ellipsoids, or still
 more easily by the consideration of the proper “spherical                                                            har

face of a nearly spherical homogeneous solid ellipsoid is approxi
mately an ellipsoid with axes differing from one another by three
fifths of the amounts of the differences of the corresponding axes of
the ellipsoidal boundary. From this it followst that a homogeneous
prolate spheroid of revolution attracts points outside it approxi

influence of the moon’s attraction would be that of 4.1 x 10°
tons force acting in the plane of the equator and in a line passing
the centre at #5 of a foot distance. Or it would be the same as
a simple frictional resistance (as of a friction-brake) consisting
of 4.1 x 10” tons force acting tangentially against the motion
of a pivot or axle of about 4 inch diameter. To estimate the
retardation produced by this, we shall suppose the square of the
earth’s radius of gyration, instead of being #, as it would be if
the mass were homogeneous, to be # of the square of the radius
of figure, as it is made to be, by Laplace's probable law of
the increasing density inwards, and by the amount of precession
calculated on the supposition that the earth is quite rigid.

accelerate the moon’s mean motion by half the same proportional
amount; and therefore a layer of meteor-dust accumulating at the
rate of ºo of a foot per century, or 1 foot in 3000 years, would suf

538           Royal Society              —Mr. J.             Evans on a possible Cause                        of
earth at the Glacial Period is constantly receiving fresh corroboration;
and various theories have been proposed which account for this acces
sion of cold in a more or less satisfactory manner.
   Variations in the distribution of land and water, changes in the
direction of the Gulf-stream, the greater or less eccentricity of the
earth's orbit, the passage of the Solar System through a cold region
in space, fluctuations in the amount of heat radiated by the sun,
alternations of heat and cold in the northern and southern hemi
spheres, as consequent upon the precession of the equinoxes, and even
changes in the position of the centre of gravity of the earth, and con
sequent displacements of the polar axis, have all been adduced as
causes calculated to produce the effects observed; and the reasoning
founded on each of these data is no doubt familiar to all.
   The possibility of any material change in the axis of rotation of
 the earth has been so distinctly denied by Laplace* and                 succeeding                all
astronomers, that any theory involving such                      change, however      a

there being a fluid nucleus within the earth's crust, will find them
well and fairly stated in Naumann’s “Lehrbuch der Geognosie”.

542            Royal Society               —Mr.            J.       Evans on a possible Cause                           of
in revolution, in the region of the equator.                                                     Or again, if one or,
better still, two opposite screws at the equator be turned inwards,
they will be found after a short period of revolution at the poles.
   Now let us assume for a moment that, though the crust was par
tially covered by water, the earth, instead of being a spheroid, was a
perfect sphere, consisting of a hardened crust of moderate thickness
supported on a fluid nucleus over which the crust could travel freely
in any direction, but both impressed with the same original rotatory
motion, so that without some disturbing cause they would continue
to revolve for ever upon the same axis, and as if they were one homo
geneous body.      Let us assume, moreover, that this crust, though in
perfect equilibrium on       centre            its                 of
                                        rotation, was not evenly spherical
externally, but had certain projecting portions, such            would                                       as               be

                               continents and islands    rising above the
level of the sea.
  It    evident that
          is              long         so                 as
                                   those continents and islands remained
unaltered     their condition and extent, the relative position
                    in                                            the crust                                       of
to  the enclosed fluid nucleus would remain unaltered also.              But sup
 posing those projecting masses were either further upheaved from
some internal cause,                     or
                               worn down and ground away               the sea                               by               or

   3. “Remarks upon the Interval of Time which has passed between
the formation of the Upper and Lower Valley-gravels of part of
England and France; with notes on the character of the Holes
bored in rocks by Mollusca.”      By A. Tylor, Esq., F.G.S.
   The difficulties attending  investigations into the relative ages of
gravel-deposits having been stated, and a résumé given of the steps
by which the opinions now current on the subject had been arrived
at, Mr. Tylor proceeded to combat the view that the Upper and
Lower Valley-gravels are separated from each other by a long
interval of time. The conclusion that man had existed on the earth
from so distant a date as is required by Mr. Prestwich's interpreta
tion of the phenomena exhibited in the valleys of the Somme and
other rivers was also considered untenable, and to prove that the
theory requiring it is erroneous.
   Accepting Mr. Godwin-Austen's theory of the Pleistocene age of
the English Channel, the author inferred from it that the excavation
of the transverse valleys of the south-east of England was similar to
that of the valleys of Devonshire, which he considers to have been
excavated in remote geological periods, and to have been filled with
gravel prior to the period of the valley-gravels, at which time the
valleys were re-excavated.     He then brought forward evidence to
show  that, in the case of the small valley in which Kent's Hole (180
feet above the sea-level) is situated, the gravel has been swept away
from the valley during an epoch immediately preceding the historic
period, and without any appearance of great denudation of the older
rocks, leaving what may be called High- and Low-level Valley
gravels on its slopes as remanié deposits; and in support of this
view he mentioned the presence of human implements in these
gravels, the existence of Pholas-perforations on the face of the rock
in which are the two openings of Kent's Hole (showing that little
weathering had taken place since), as well as the occurrence of a
bed of red clay, or loess, 80 feet thick, and 220 feet at        its
                                                            base above
the sea-level.
  The age       the Kent's Hole Valley was identified with that
                  of
                                                                          in as of of
                                                                       the
Valley      the Somme,

                              account       the similar position
                                                 of                    the
gravels and           of
                  the raised beaches      the  coast-line,
                                                 at              as
                                                               well    the
similarity       of
              levels and    the organic contents

two valleys.
  In  conclusion Mr. Tylor gave        note  a        on
                                                 the character          of

                 On the Geology    of the Lake-country,             547.
               By Sir Philip de M. Grey Egerton, Bart., M.P., F.R.S.,
    Owing to the kindness of Mr. Ward, of Longton, the author had
been enabled to examine a considerable collection of specimens of
the Acanthodean fishes of the North Staffordshire Coal-field. The
specimens were all imperfect, the anterior parts of the fish being
rarely preserved, and even when present being in a very mutilated
condition; but Sir Philip Egerton had been able to determine the
distinctness of at least one species, which he now described as
Acanthodes Wardi.       This species was far less bulky and more elon
gated than A. Bronni from the Saarbrück Coal-field; but it was not
so slender as A. gracilis from the Permian beds of Klein Neudorf.
    2. “A sketch of the Gravels and Drift of the Fenland.” By Harry
 Seeley, Esq., F.G.S.
    By the Fenland was understood the flat country west of the
 Chalk Hills of Norfolk, from Hunstanton to Cambridge, thence to
Bedford, and northwards to Peterborough.          Three kinds of Drift
were described as occurring in this region—namely, Boulder-clay
covering the high land, a coarse gravel which caps the hills, and the
 fine gravel of the plains.    Mr. Seeley gave first a sketch of their
distribution over the area under consideration, and then described
 some of their most important exposures, especially the sections at
 March, Barnwell, and Hunstanton.          He also gave lists of the
marine shells found at    March, occurring  between Boulder-clays, and
 those found at Hunstanton, which are of much later date; also of
 the bones and land and freshwater shells found at Barnwell, including
 one bone described as having been cut by man previous to deposi
                                                                         -
 tion in the gravel.
     Comparing the drift of the Fenland with that of the Eastern
 Counties, Mr. Seeley inferred that the brown clay of the latter dis
 trict corresponds with the brown boulder-clay, which is the oldest
 drift-deposit in the former, and that the hill-gravel, the blue boulder
 clay, and perhaps the shell-bed of March, correspond to the Con
 torted Drift.
     3. “Additional Observations on the Geology of the Lake-country.”
 By Prof. R. Harkness, F.R.S., F.G.S., and H. Nicholson, Esq.
 With a Note on the Trilobites; by J. W. Salter, Esq., F.G.S.
     The authors having first communicated the following additions
 to the fauna of the Skiddaw slates—namely, from the lower strata,
 Phacops Nicholsoni, n. sp., AEglina binodosa, and Lingula brevis; and
 from the upper beds, Diplograpsus teretiusculus and Agnostis morea—
 they stated that fossiliferous rocks had been diseovered by them
 among the “ash-beds” of the Lake-country on the same horizon as
 those associated with the purely igneous rocks of the eastern parts
  of Cumberland and Westmoreland, which underlie the Coniston
 Limestone, and are of Caradoc age. This discovery has thus placed
 the green rocks of the Lake-country in the same position.
     The Caradoc formation of the Lake-country was stated to em
  brace three divisions—namely, the Coniston Flags and Grits, the
  Coniston Limestone, and the Igneous rocks and ash-beds; and the
  following organic remains were enumerated as having been obtained

 548             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
  from the Coniston Flags and Grits, the uppermost division of the
 formation:—Graptolithus Ludensis, Diplograpsus pristis, Phacops
 obtusicordatus, Orthis crispa, Cardiola interrupta, Orthoceras filosum,
  O. tenuistriatum, and O. subannulatum.
     4. “On the Lower Silurian Rocks of the Isle of Man.”               By
  Prof. R.   Harkness,   F.R.S.,  F.G.S., and H.  Nicholson, Esq.
     The older sedimentary deposits, which occupy the greater part of
 the island, have been regarded by previous observers as Lower
  Silurian. These slates were described by the authors as forming an
 anticlinal axis which traverses the island in a north-east and south
 west direction, and to be conformably overlain at Douglas Head and
 Banks How on the south-eastern part of the island, by green ash
 beds (slates and porphyries).
     The only fossil of the slates is the Palaeochorda major of the
  Skiddaw slates; and from the circumstance that the Lower Silurian
 rocks of the Isle of Man are in the exact line of strike of the Skiddaw
 slates of the Lake-country, the authors regarded these beds as cor
 responding with them; and the “green ash-beds” were considered
 to be the equivalents of the ash-beds and porphyries which succeed
 the Skiddaw slates.

 oN THE LAW of THE UNION OF SIMPLE substancEs, AND on
     ATTRACTIONS AT SMALL DISTANCES,             BY MM. ATHANASE AND
     PAUL DUPRé.
              of weighings in measuring
 THE useprecision                          work and molecular forces leads
        to a            which had not been hitherto attained. It has be
 come possible to commence the study of attractions at small distances;
 and there is reason to hope for an early and considerable progress
 in those branches of the physical sciences which are more directly
 connected with molecular mechanics.
     When two bodies, terminated by plane parallel faces, approach till
 they are in contact, a work is effected proportional to the surface,
 and independent of the thickness, provided this exceeds the radius e
 of the sphere of sensible attraction.     We have shown that the same
number represents this work, the force of union, and the force of
 contraction of the superficial layer; the apparatus for determining
it have been described (memoir addressed to the Academy in October
 1865, and Annales de Chimie et de Physique, February, March, and
April 1866). If reduced by calculation to the unit of surface and
unit of specific gravity, the result obtained for each body becomes
 comparable with analogous numbers.          The two plates which unite
may moreover be of the same nature, or may have a different che
mical composition; it is convenient to represent the force of union
                f
by a symbol accompanied by a chemical indication of the bodies'
                      f
in question; thus # represents the force of the union of mercury
with itself after reduction to unity, and      fº  that of hydrogen with
oxygen.       By the aid of this notation the force of union of a com

                     Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                549
pound body may be calculated as a function of the union of ele
ments which it is often impossible to obtain in a direct manner.   By
equating the values found by experiment, an equation is obtained
which contains in fact several unknown quantities; but other com
pounds containing the same simple substances in different propor
tions furnish new equations; and provided their number is sufficiently
great, not only the numbers sought, but also very valuable verifica
tions are obtained. This research, which will be communicated com
pletely to the Academy when finished, has already given a most
                                                                       -
important law.
   The forces of union of simple substances reduced to the unit
of surface and of specific gravity are inversely proportional to their
equivalents.
   For hydrogen we have obtained 27 milligrammes per millimetre,
and that by four methods:
   (1) By means of mercury.
   (2) By means of bromine.
   (3) By means of oil of turpentine and benzole.
   (4) By means of water, wood-spirit, and benzole.
   But we only propose this figure as the result of a primary study
of the fundamental number; it will probably undergo some correc
tions after the experiments have been renewed, and the products
completely purified. The experiments to be made are long and
delicate; great precautions must be taken to avoid serious errors.
   The facts already confirmed refer to definite integrals; hence it is
probable, though not quite certain, that
   At the same very small distance, and with an equal specific gra
vity, two elements of volume of a simple substance exert on each
other an attraction the value of which must be simply multiplied by
the ratio of the equivalents if it is to be applied to another simple
substance.
   This law of attraction evidently reproduces the experimental law
of the forces of union.                It  leads directly to several other laws
which we shall examine               experimentally, of which the following are
the enunciations:—
  In simple substances the attractions on contact, reduced to the
unit of surface and of specific gravity, are inversely as the equivalents.
   In simple substances the ratio of attraction on contact to the force
of union is—
   (1) Independent of the specific gravity.
   (2) Independent of the chemical nature.
   (3) Independent of the molecular grouping.

same  temperature   and  pressure, are  multiplied  together:—
  (1) The chemical equivalent.
  (2) The coefficient           of
                         expansion for constant pressure.
  (3) The inverse          of
                      the coefficient             of
                                         compressibility.

dently in great measure.
   When a simple substance unites with another element, the force
of union is not always attractive; and thus we have an explanation of
facts hitherto difficult to understand—for instance, the heat produced
by the decomposition of binoxide of nitrogen. The atoms of oxy
gen and those of nitrogen attract at distances greater than e with a
force (universal gravity) which is only appreciable for large masses.

made      traverse the interval
            to                     ee',  they may  remain united. These
latter views are partly hypothetical; hence we shall not fail         sub                                          to

                 used which are very pure, and capable       furnishing                                  of
the best determinations.      With ternary compounds,      the choice                               if                    is

greater.     From the number of bands from one Fraunhofer's line to
another, the wave-length of the latter may be calculated when that
of the first is known.
   To determine a wave-length directly, independent of another, the
difference of phase for the place of the spectrum in question must be
successively increased or diminished.      Therefore a removal of the in.
terference-bands sets in. From the number of the bands which have
passed through the cross wires, and the change of the difference of
phase thus produced, the wave-length can be calculated for the place

obtained by pushing over each other two quartz wedges.            Such an
apparatus was not at hand, and the following method was therefore
used. The column of quartz was turned slowly out of               position                          its                 :
