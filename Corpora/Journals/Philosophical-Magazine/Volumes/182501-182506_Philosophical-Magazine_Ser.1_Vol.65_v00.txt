I.   On the Method              of      the Least Squares.                      By     J.   Ivory, Esq.
                                          M.A. F.R.S.
THE   present advanced state of astronomy is to be ascribed
  chiefly to the precision of the theories, and to the great
exactness of modern observations.        But there is another cir
cumstance which has likewise contributed much to the same
end; and that             is,
                    the method        combining the observations
                                                 of
so   as  draw from them the most advantageous results.
          to                                                                                             In
general     very few observations are sufficient for approxima
               a
ting  tothe quantity               of    an
                             astronomical element with         consi                             a
derable degree            of
                    precision.     But the errors unavoidable by
the most skilful observers must always leave some uncertainty
                                                                                                         a be
in  such determinations. The utmost precision can only
obtained            by
               multiplying the observations, and           making                           by
great number, embracing every possible variety              circum                             of

                                       the same element.      Astro
nomers accomplish this end            the use    by
                                                  equations      con         of                     of

              Mr. Ivory                  on the Method                       of the Least Squares.
O + e = V. Wherefore, by substituting the development of
V, and putting m-O-V", we shall obtain this equation of
condition,
                               e    = —m +                   aa' + by             +    cz   + &c.
Every observation will furnish a like equation. In this pro
blem, therefore, we have a system consisting of any number
of equations, viz.
             e = —                + a r + b y + cz +&c.
                                           m
             e' = —            m' + a'r + by +c'z +&c.
                         e"= — m'+ a'r + by +c"z +&c.
               &c.
And it is     required   to determine the corrections a, y, z, so
as to make the errors e, e,         &c. either absolutely equal   e",
                       possible, otherwise                                                 so                                 beto
zero when this                      is           that they shall
contained within the least limits.        When the number of the
equations      just equal
                   is          the unknown quantitiesto           &c.,                                     r,   y,   z,

                     the cases that occur        practice, the num                         in
ber      equations being greater than the corrections
         of                                                                                                             to    be
found,        no

                                    of

Supposing every error equal                                            to    zero, Cotes finds the several

                   Mr. Ivory             on the Method                    of the Least               Squares.                     5
of the errors equal to zero; for the value of         a found in this
manner will coincide with the expression just set down. And
hence we may conclude, that the mode of combining the
equations of condition imagined by Cotes is not the most ad
vantageous.       For, as the total sum of the errors is equal to
zero, an error of a given amount in any of the equations has
the same influence on the value of the correction.             But it is
very evident that the error e produces a small variation in
the value of a when a is a great number; and, on the con
trary, a great variation when the same coefficient is inconsi
derable. The procedure of Cotes is therefore just and unex
ceptionable only when             the coefficients,   all   a”, &c. are                          a,     a<U+017F>,

 Thus the condition of the equilibrium of the levers makes
 the sum of the squares of the errors a minimum; and hence
   we may infer that the errors themselves are contained within
   the least limits on either side of the common fulcrum.              the                                   If
  errors vary from the minimum, they cannot                   decrease;                     all
   any  of   them decrease, others must increase; and some

equation, being that particular case of it when the coefficients
are  allequal. But although the first demonstration        suffi                                                          be

a function must possess; but it is impossible that one can be
found that will accurately represent a probability, of which
we never can acquire a perfect knowledge. Therefore, al
though the same conclusion be still brought out, yet, as the
reasoning involves precarious suppositions, the fundamental
principles will not be placed in a light so simple and clear
and steady as when nothing extraneous is introduced in the
                                                                                        j
demonstration.      It has been proved in the case of a great
number of    observations,  that the principle of the least squares
will hold good, whatever law of probability be adopted; and
hence we may derive an argument that such laws are foreign
 to the demonstration, since they disappear at the conclusion.
If  we admit that, whatever be the expression of the chance of
 an error, the mean of the squares of the errors will converge
 to a fixed limit as the observations increase in number, the
 second of the two demonstrations given above will be con
 clusive in all possible laws of probability.
    But, allowing that the method of the least squares is fully
 established, it is not sufficient for the purposes of astronom

            Gentlemen,
THAT    great mechanical genius Dr. Hooke seems                                         to
 .
                                                   have
  been the first who suspected that the sunbeam contains
 rays which illuminate without producing heat.         this opi                    In
 nion           he
           has been followed   successively      M. Scheele, Sir        by
 William Herschel, and Sir Henry Englefield, who are well                                            -
 known      able experimenters. Among other conclusions, the
                  as
 two last thought they had established that the sun emits se
 veral distinct sorts    rays, especially illuminating rays,
                                          of                                                 as
 already mentioned, which give     heat; and             no

          rays which are not accompanied with light.     For                                 on      <U+017F>

 spectrum, this thermometer seemed to be more affected the
 nearer it was placed to the red margin, and less as it ap
 proached the opposite or violet-coloured edge.          But the most
 remarkable effect of all was, that the thermometer indicated
 the greatest heat when placed just without the red margin,
 where none of the visible rays reached it at all. They there
 fore inferred that this effect was produced by a set of dark
 calorific rays which are less refrangible than any of the other
 rays. On repeating these experiments, M. Berard obtained
 similar results, except that he found the maximum of heat in
 the red ray.
    But notwithstanding the high reputation of these philoso
 phers, their conclusion has been questioned by Professor
 Leslie of Edinburgh, who by experimenting somewhat diffe
 rently was unable to detach any of these dark rays from the
light.    Having rendered a circular spot opaque in the middle
 of a large convex lens, he received the light transmitted by
 the remaining transparent ring upon a surface of black wax,
 held at such a distance that the light formed upon the wax
 an iris, or ring, composed of a set of distinct concentric rings,
 which severally possessed              all
                                    the various colours      the com         of
mon spectrum.        Mr. Leslie then carefully observed the effect
                  it on
of  these rings     the wax, and found that none                    of
                                                           was melted   it
beyond where         was covered              by
                                       the iris; whereas         set            if   a       of
dark calorific rays had existed, these ought               have more    to
 thoroughly melted        larger ring than that whereon the light
                               a
fell; for the dark rays,        less refrangible than light, would
                                   if
have fallen without the     margin       the red ring, which includes
                                               of
 all the others.
    Now, since this experiment                of
                                        Professor Leslie         more        is   of a
simple and decisive cast than any performed                the gentle   to by
men already mentioned,           am much inclined
                                   I                       give     the              of it
preference, and           to
                        conclude with him that the       rays     light
only produce           become heat when they themselves
                      or                                            dis
appear.     It    also well known that the more perfectly any
                 is
surface reflects light, the less will that surface itself       heated            be
 by  the light.

in which 2, the length of the seconds pendulum at the equator,
and y, the excess of the seconds pendulum at the pole above
that at the equator, are the only unknown quantities.
  As the equator is accessible in many points, we may shortly
expect to have z well determined; though it will not be easy,

perhaps impossible, ever to obtain y by actual experiment.
  We have used this care in detailing the manner in which
we obtained the general formula, and selected the values of the
            employed, that it might be apparent what confi
  ence results derived from it deserved. This was the more ne
cessary, as we have shown, page 169, that the ellipticity derived
from the measurement of arcs, and that determined from the
observations by the pendulum, were in mean latitudes, as well
                                                              opposed
as extreme latitudes, though in a less degree, directly
to each   other,  upon  the assumption     that  the arc  of the  meri
dian is a portion of a  regular  ellipse”.
   As we discussed the experiments of Kater, Biot, &c., sepa
rately in our last communication, we have, in order to throw
some light, if possible, upon this anomaly, here combined
them along with others which we have since obtained, making
                                                                equator
as nearly as possible a regular series of them from the
towards the north   pole, retaining   one  only,  that at Rio  Janeiro,
in the southern hemisphere, as being near the equator, and
having without        it,
                     proportionally      the others, rather too few

     The numbers in column A are              the differences between the
 results from       experiment      and calculation by the formula, the
 sign — showing that the calculated lengths are less than those
 by experiment, and + that they are greater.                   The numbers
                                                          those in A, suc
               X.
 in column As are obtained              by  subtracting
 cessively from each other, retaining the algebraic signs.
     On duly considering the quantities in A1, it appears that
 the first five are negative; the next eight, with the exception
 of that at                       are positive; and again, the last five
 are negative.
     with the regularity of these signs            I  was forcibly struck;
 and after a little reflection          strongly   suspected that it was
 owing to some peculiarity in the form of the earth, more
 especially as these apparently show some connexion with
 what I formerly observed with regard to the ellipticity derived
 from the measurement of arcs in the corresponding latitudes.
 —If the figure of the earth is not that of a regular ellipsoid,
  what modification must it receive in order to satisfy these
  conditions 2
      It is evident, since the length of the pendulum by experi
                                                                          º
  ment exceeds that derived from computation on the elliptical
 hypothesis at Galapagos, Madras, San Blas, Rio Janeiro,
 and Formentera, that the gravitating force is greater at
                                                                         places

 16                  Mr. W. Galbraith           on the Euperiments
i.  laces  than theory supposes.     On the same principles it is
      from Figeac to Clifton; and again, greater from Leith
 to Melville Island.      The irregularity of the densities of the
 materials    constituting  the crust of the globe, combined with
 the small errors of    observation,  produce a considerable num
ber of discrepancies, as may be remarked from consulting
column As: but these appear to be insufficient to account for
 such marked and regular differences, especially when regard
is had to their signs, as are shown in column A1.
     Ifit is not demonstrated by these observations, it is at least
rendered extremely probable, that the form of the earth differs
somewhat considerably from a regular spheroid.
    Since from the measurement of arcs near the equator, com
pared with others in considerably high northern latitudes, the
ellipticity is in general about                        while that derived from the
                                               310°
            kind of measures at mean latitudes near the parallel of

same
45° N. is about                  nearly double          of   the former,                it is only
necessary    to give the arc of the meridian at 45° N. a greater
 curvature than the elliptical hypothesis supposes, to satisfy
 these conditions.                                                     -
    Again: since the length of the pendulum is shorter at 45°
 N. than theory requires; if a protuberance or swelling out of
 the earth be supposed to occur there, so as to place the ex
 perimental pendulum at a greater distance from the centre of
 the earth, thereby rendering the gravitating force less, while
 the equatorial and polar regions contract a little; then the
theory would not disagree with the observed phaenomena.

correction to be applied for a variation in the length of the
pendulum of one-tenth of an inch, or when it is increased from
39 to 39:1 inches; and is always to be added. By means of

    Capt. Kater found that his experimental pendulum at
London, in latitude 51° 31' 8" N., after the proper reductions
made 86061:52 oscillations in a mean solar day at 62° Fah
renheit; while at Unst, in latitude 60° 45'28"N., the same
pendulum, at the same temperature, made 86096-90 oscillations.

differing only one unit in the fifth decimal place from the de
termination of Capt. Kater.
   In the application of the corrections of the formula, the
equation of second difference and that from column 4 are ap
plied as they ought to be to the first part of the correction
from column 2, with contrary signs. Indeed, it is unnecessary
to carry them further than about five or six places of decimals,
 being more than even the best observations can warrant, as may
 be readily seen by comparing those of Kater and Biot at the
 same place; as for example, at Leith or Unst.              In fact, with
 out the small corrections, the formula in this case would have
given Kater's determination exactly.

  The French mathematicians generally give the length of
the pendulum according, to their new system of weights and
measures.   In this case the day is supposed to be divided into
100,000 seconds, instead of the 86,400 seconds according to
old    custom.

squares of the number of oscillations in the same time; and
the length of the standard metre at the freezing point, com

        The motion of Jupiter's aphelion and Saturn's, since they
arise almost entirely from the action of each other, and as
their masses are best determined from their mutual periodical
inequalities, it is almost useless to examine the motions of
their aphelia from observation: the motion of their nodes,
however, depends in a great measure on Venus and Mars; we
shall therefore examine them.
   For Jupiter there is still some uncertainty; however, De
lambre makes it about 35°7, with a possible error of 2 or 3
seconds.     Lalande employs this motion in his Tables.   For
 Saturn, Delambre makes the motion 33"-35: Lalande, 31"-7.
The mean of these, since they agree so nearly, cannot be far
from the truth; we shall therefore suppose it 32°52. -

I CANNOT J.

interests of science to the        personal    pretensions of any one.
I trust that no such sacrifice has ever been looked for on my
part; nor should I honour the man who would offer                     But                            it.

essentially confirming them, led me               reconsider the subject

               Sir J. E. Smith's Answer                   to     Mr. Lindley.                         31
If he                 I hadno such right, he ought to have given the
                                                        º,
        believed
honour where he supposed it to be due. To publish the opi
nions of M. du Petit-Thouars as entirely novel in this country,
betrays what           I
                      should hope is                    an unacquaintance
with this branch of science and literature. I am flattered to find
these opinions so powerfully confirm mine.                   But whether or
not this truly eminent philosopher agrees with me in every
detail, or whether, as it appears, he has carried his inquiries
further, and made more very interesting remarks, than pro                                         I
fess to have done, especially concerning Buds,                    hope may         I              I
be excused for      attending     to other   things.    Practical Botany is
my pursuit, and Nature my book.                    five known in my time
                                                             I
the “celebrated philosophers” of France, and their “violent
opposition” to one another... . How they “cover themselves
with glory,” and how Englishmen, who have little credit at
home, cover themselves likewise with what they can borrow.
Mr. Lindley's character and abilities are above                      this, and         all
I    hope   he thinks        as
                           well         of
                                    mine.                If
                                                     have differed from him
                                                         I

not mentioned him                  way
                                  in   a    give offence, and should
                                                   to                                                 be
very sorry       if   he
                      has taken any.

“    the interests     of

a     truly eminent botanical philosopher, though                  great cor       a
ruptor    of   our terminology,          his translator

Dr.   Young    calls his latest solution       the problem, published   of
in  the Philosophical Tranactions 1824, and another particular

 a certain value is given to the indefinite index.                                      Secondly,
 Dr. Young was aware that the two solutions were a part of
 my theory when he published them.      For my paper was be
 fore the author in manuscript when he wrote the XIVth Num
 ber of the Astronomical Collections; and when he speaks of
 the equation y = 2 #, the words imply that he had compared
 it with other particular cases of my general formulae, having
 different exponents. The other formula, y = #2 *            #2°, he                    –
 never mentions without      noticing  that it belongs  to a class of
 atmospheres which                    I
                          had excluded; excluded, however, for
 no other reason than that they did not seem to approach so
 near nature as another class.      Thirdly, Dr. Young has found
 out no    physical   property   of the two atmospheres he has
 chosen which is not      expressly   developed in my paper.      He
 lays, indeed, great stress on the mathematical property, which
 they possess, of exhibiting the refraction in a finite form.
 But, besides that this consideration is really of no moment
 and can weigh nothing in the balance against the least physi
 cal advantage, it is no discovery; for the two assumptions of
 Dr. Young are immediately deduced from my general for
 mulae, by choosing the particular value of the index that will
 make the radical in the expression of the refraction a qua
 dratic trinomial.     Fourthly, Dr. Young has nowhere inves
tigated either of the two assumptions. It is easy to take the
expressions when they are found out, and, by substituting
them in the formula for the refraction, to show that the re
sults are integrable; which is           that Dr. Young has done.

 But the   question    how      came

can    hardly      supposedbe    lead     such particular formulae.
There must have been some train                              of

           In                                                                                     I

cussion, what then advanced requires to be qualified in any
respect.    Precision requires that we consider separately the
infinite  series,  after the manner of Brook Taylor, and the
finite formula which expresses the density by the four first
powers of the refraction.
     Imade no observation on the infinite series, except that it
does not converge; and                           I
                                proved the want of convergency in
a  particular   instance.     This brought upon me a torrent of
vehement    writing    not confined within the limits of bienseance.
Since that time, mathematicians, whom Dr. Young dares not
treat with so little ceremony, have come to the same conclu
sion. There is now so great a relaxation in asserting the
convergency, that it is not necessary to add anything more on
this head.
   In the Historical Sketch the finite formula of four terms is
called an approximatory method. I cannot find any good rea
son why this name is given to             As the coefficients are

       Gentlemen,
 Sºº          the time of that eminent mathematician, astrono
  '-2 mer and mechanic, Christian Huygens, great improve
                                                                                                             ||º
 ments have been made in the construction of horological in
 struments, and especially in those most important parts re
 lating to the clock—I mean the scapement and the pendulum.
     It is well known that our atmosphere is often subject to
 great and sudden vicissitudes with respect to pressure, tempe
 rature, dryness and moisture; and these causes, operating in a
 greater or less degree upon the different parts of the mecha
                                                                                                   of its
 nism of the clock, must always have a tendency to render
 motion unequal, and for that rºason unfit for the purpose
 showing the different portions                      of
                                          time with accuracy.
     To obviate the effects arising from these different causes,
 many ingenious contrivances have been adopted.
     The variations indicated                by
                                      the barometer must         some de
                                                          by                    of in
 gree affect the arc         vibration,
                              of             the  changes       buoyancy
 and resistance; but the error from this source cannot               great,             be
 owing    tothe ponderous materials          which our best pendulums
                                                          of
 are made, their slow motion, smooth surface, and lenticular
 form.
    On the other hand, the effects arising from the hygrome
                         of              do
                                                                                                  in in of
trical changes         the air       very perceptibly alter the arcs
vibration, they being considerably greater                  moist thanin  a
a   dry state       of
                   the atmosphere; hence, the clock will lose
the former case and gain             the latter.
                                         in        This       great evil,  is a
and am
     I          opinion
               of          that the most    perfect jewelling     the pal          of

     From these cases it certainly appears reasonable                to sup
pose that the cycloidal checks would be of service, and I see
no good reason why they are not now used; as surely a mo

sary for the involute arc of vibration, performed by a seconds
pendulum, could easily be made. But otherwise,                    think Mr.       I
 Farnham's plan, of facing the pallets with segments of cylin
ders, to be the best that has ever been invented, for rendering
the arc of vibration constant, provided that under such circum
stances a perfect dead beat scapement can be preserved.
     I come now to speak of the pendulum simply in itself; and
from the nature and importance of this                            to a clock
it requires more than ordinary consideration. Now as it is
well known that           all
                           metals expand with heat and contract with
cold, for this reason the simple pendulum, when constructed
wholly     of such materials,       found
                                        is            useless where great

 better acquaintance with the mysteries of nature. Every clas
 sical reader, as well as every entomologist, is familiar with
the word Oestrus as the name of one of the most celebrated
insects of antiquity.  The insect itself, however,
                                            “cui   momen Asilo
                       Romanum    est, GEstron     Graii vertere vocantes.”

 has not for this been the more accurately determined; and
 Olivier is the first modern naturalist who appears to have sus
pected that the OEstrus of the ancients and the OEstrus of the
moderns are totally different insects.    With an exception in
favour of Messrs. Latreille, Kirby and Spence, this curious
remark seems not to have excited much attention; although
it may easily be proved that Olivier has come much nearer the
truth than those who hold the contrary opinion.
   In investigations of the following nature, it is not only ad
vantageous but necessary to begin from some fixed and indis
putable position.      Now such I take to be the identity of the
insects termed in French taon ; in Spanish tavano ; in Italian
tabano; and in Latin tabanus.      The tabani are unfortunately
insects too common for their name to have ever been forgot
ten; and knowing what the country-people in France call
taons, we know the insects which Pliny anciently termed tabani.
By comparing Pliny with Aristotle, we find that he invariably
translates the word wºwº (caecutiens) by the Latin word taba
mus; and entomologists know well that this Greek name is
extremely appropriate to the modern tabani or taons, which
are so remarkable for their eyes, that a common species of
Chrysops has at the present day the trivial epithet of caecutiens.
Now it appears from Aristotle, that the         Tpo;   and pºwl,oia   +
were insects extremely near each other        affinity; they are
                                                           in

Now this, by the way, proves notonly that the clargo; was not
the modern (Estrus, but moreover that Aristotle could never
have seen a modern (Estrus attack cattle; for had he seen                                                  it,

know, however, of the latter genus answers in no one respect
to the description above given of the ancient (Estrus, which
certainly was an insect allied to the modern Tabanus; whereas
Nemestrina has no immediate connexion with it either in eco
nomy or structure. Besides, no Nemestrina has ever yet been
found in Europe.        The argument for Pangonia is rather
stronger, as this is not only an European genus, but one nearly
allied to Tabanus. Aristotle however says, that his CEstrus
and Myops have both a strong tongue (ioxweavywarray xoval);
a description in perfect accord with the mouth of a modern
 Tabanus, but quite at variance with the long, weak and flex
ible proboscis of Pangonia, which can scarcely be supposed
capable of piercing the hide of an ox. Olivier and Latreille
indeed both state, that the long trunk of Pangonia, like that
of Bombylius, only serves for sucking flowers. But to insects
that suck flowers Aristotle expressly places his         reo;   op                     via        in

   Bruce, whose reputation as an authority has, contrary to
that of some travellers, increased with the increasing know
ledge obtained of the countries which he visited, contributed
considerably to the stock of information concerning the Natu
ral History of the Bible.      Preparatory to his great expedi
tion, he studied the Oriental languages, at Algiers, with great
zeal and diligence; and from a knowledge of the original lan
guages of the Scriptures, he claims an advantage over pre
vious travellers in the East, who were either not at all, or but
very superficially acquainted with those languages. He made
it a rule also, in describing plants and animals which he saw,
to prefer those mentioned in Scripture, particularly where
doubts had arisen among translators and commentators.            To
these authorities on the     subject  of  plants, Dr. Harris adds
 Dioscorides and Pliny, among the ancients; and Alpinus,
Rauwolf, Shaw, Russell, Forskal, and others, among the mo
derns.

  Another authority, confined to no particular department of
the Natural History of the Bible, is J. J. Scheuchzer, who
died in 1731.    His great work, Physique Sacrée, embraces a
wide range  of inquiry  and speculation, not only concerning the
Natural History  of the Bible, but every thing remarkable in the
works of art. It may be supposed, that in eight folio volumes
on the subjects above enumerated, there would be enough, and
more than enough, both of that which depends on evidence, and
of that which is merely theoretical; but to an author who knows
 how to separate the wheat from the chaff, superfluity, though
often troublesome, does not produce loathing or disgust. It was,
we presume, by such a spirit of patient inquiry, that Dr. Har
 ris was enabled     endure the strange vagaries
                            to                         Parkhurst, for           of

                                                 a
by his boldness, contribute towards probability and truth. Of
Scheuchzer Dr. Harris has made principal use for determining
the serpents and insects mentioned          Scripture.   Rudbeck in                                   is
his  principal authority for the fishes, and Lemnius and Braunius
for the minerals and precious stones.
    In the use he has made       the authors above mentioned, and
                                                of

ready and perfectly exact method of determining the position
of the horizontal or zenith point on the limb of a circle or ze
nith sector.        Its principle is the invariability with respect to
the horizon of the position assumed by any body of invari
able figure and weight floating on a fluid. It consists of a
rectangular box containing mercury, on which is floated a
mass of cast-iron about twelve inches long, four broad, and
half an inch thick, having two short uprights or Y's of equal
height, cast in one piece with the rest.                 On these     ...firmly                 is

     Jan. 14.—At the meeting this evening,                   Mr. Baily laid on
the table, for the inspection of the members, two micrometers,
which have been recently invented and constructed  -
                                                        by M.
 Frauenhofer, of Munich”.
                                               aJ.
   These micrometers are formed by means of very fine lines
cut on glass with a diamond point in               manner; and
placed in the focus of the telescope.      ne of these microme
ters consists of concentric circular lines drawn at unequal                     di
stances from each other; and the other consists of straight
lines crossing each other at a given angle. The mode of
cutting these lines has furnished M. Frauenhofer with a me
thod of illuminating them, which (at the same time that it
renders the lines visible) leaves the other part of the field of
the telescope in darkness: so that the transits of the smallest
stars may be observed by means of these micrometers; the
lines appearing like so many silver threads suspended in the
heavens.    A short account of the circumstances which led
M. Frauenhofer to this happy invention was read.
   An engraving of Frauenhofer's achromatic telescope, now
at Dorpat, of 14 feet focus and 9 inches aperture, was also
submitted to the inspection of the members present, by Mr.
Herschel.
     A communication was read from Capt. Ross, dated Stran
 raer, 7th August 1824, in which he transmits a diagram ex
hibiting his observation of the occultation of Herschel's planet
by the moon, on the preceding day, with Ramage's 25-feet
telescope, and a power of 500.     The planet appeared to have
entered about one-third of         its
                                 diameter               on

    Jan. 21.—A paper was concluded, entitled “On a recent
formation of freshwater rock marl in Scotland, with remarks
on shell marl, and on the analogy between the ancient and
modern freshwater formations.” By Charles Lyell, Esq. Sec.
G. S.
     The rock marl described in this communication is an ex
tremely compact limestone, in part of a crystalline structure,
and traversed by numerous irregular tubes or cavities.
     As a principal part of               its

      Mr. Lyell then considers, the probable origin                the rock of
  marl, which appears                     be
                                   derived from subjacent shell marl,

      Some remarks are next offered on the shell marl of Forfar
  shire, and some which the author has examined near Romsey

 into.
      In conclusion, Mr. Lyell takes general view      a         the analogy       of
 between the ancient and modern freshwater formations.

portion heated by the spirit lamp in a glass tube closed at one
end gave off first acidulous water; some sulphur next sub
limed and condensed at a little distance from the flame, and
soon after a red substance, which condensed on the sides of the
tube between the flame and the sulphur, and very near the
former.     During the sublimation of the red matter, the lower
       of the tube was filled with a yellow vapour, a good deal
É.ike chlorine, but of a deeper colour, and an unpleasant odour
was exhaled, very similar to that of cabbage water.     After the
whole of the volatile matter had been sublimed, a fixed dark
coloured residuum remained at the bottom of the tube.       This
was transferred to another    tube, open at both ends, and again
heated; some more of the red sublimate was thus obtained, and
the residuum assumed a grey colour.        It amounted to about
53   per cent. of the weight of the substance operated on, and
on examination was found to consist of earthy matter, princi
pally silica and lime; consequently the assay contains about
47 per cent. of volatile matters, by far the greatest portion of
which consists of the red sublimate. The red sublimate had
                                                  ..
evidently been fused and spread over the inner surface of the
tube.
          When detached from the tube, a morsel of it imparted the
same beautiful blue colour to flame that has been already men
tioned, but more intense.
   Another fragment, heated in a tube open at both ends, sub
limed without giving off any sulphur, exhaling at the same time
a strong odour similar to that of                    It fused very
readily on being gently heated in a close tube over the lamp,
and remained for some time in a soft pasty state.
   These experiments are quite sufficient to establish the iden
tity of our red sublimate with selenium, and in external cha
racters also it perfectly answers the description of that sub
stance. It has a metallic lustre, and a deep brown colour when
seen by reflected light.    Its fracture is conchoidal, and has a
vitreous lustre. It is  easily  scratched by the knife, is brittle,
and         its
          powder  has     deep red colour; but

   He found, on the summit of a quartzose mound from 30 to 40
feet high, a round cavity, 12 feet deep, 12 long, and 9 broad.
Its sides consisted of very shattered quartz, spotted brown by
oxide of iron, and covered profusely with acicular yellow and
white crystals of sulphur.   The lower parts of the cavity were
studded with masses of iron pyrites, of which there is a vein
at the bottom of the cavity.   It is a foot and a half thick, and
disseminates itself into the  surrounding     quartz. This vein
may be seen, running east with a very

has disappeared,       it may then be difficult in fact to distinguish
between them.          But between both of these and the newer red
sandstone there is a complete and total separation. To those
rocks the newer red sandstone is unconformable in position,
and whenever in contact with them reposes on their basset
edges: it is usually unaffected by the faults and disturbances
to which they are subject; it is itself partly made up of the
fragments derived from their ruins; and must therefore have
been deposited after their consolidation, dislocation, and partial
destruction.    It is impossible, therefore, to imagine any
stronger grounds on which any two series of rocks can be re
garded as distinct: and should we agree to throw these to
gether, we might with equal propriety consider          groups                              all                   of

                          OPENING OF        A   MUMMY.
   On Thursday evening, 9th Dec., was unwrapped at the Bris
tol Institution the body of an Egyptian mummy, which it is
understood was removed by Mr. Salt from a catacomb in the
Thebais, and sent down the Nile to Alexandria, and thence
to Bristol.    The case, which was beautifully covered with
hieroglyphics, exhibited rather the copper-coloured counte
nance of a Nubian, than the expanded forehead and wide eye
sockets of an Ethiopian.   The upper part of the shell being
removed, there arose a peculiar, but not unpleasant, odour.
The body was remarkably light, and wrapped up in a multi
tude of folds of cotton cloth, which was stained of a yellowish
brown colour.      Upon the removal of the circular bandages,
there  appeared   a long wrapper from the chin to the toes, with
a double border of blue stripes in front. The innermost layer
of cloth was soaked in naphtha, asphaltum, or some bitumi
nous substance, combined probably with natron.          The skin
was blackened, and the neck and one of the hands had been
 attacked by a peculiar sort of coleopterous insect, apparently
 a dermestes. In other respects, this curious specimen of anti
 quity was very perfect, indeed much more so than usually hap
 pens. It was the body of (probably) a young female. The hands
were placed straight upon the thighs, and not, as most fre
quently happens, across the bosom.      The hair upon the head
was   perfect, of a brownish auburn  colour, short, but not at all
wearing the character of a negro's. The contour of the coun
tenance strengthened the opinion that the subject belonged to
a province closely bordering upon the confines of Egypt. The
coverings of the chest and stomach being removed, exhibited,
in high preservation, the heart and lungs, and                 all
                                                   the intestines:
indeed    it did not appear that any part had been removed.
 Whether the brain had been extracted was not ascertained;
neither were the teeth examined,          was thought advisable
                                                as   it
to  subject the head altogether      more leisurely and minute
                                           to
                                            a
observation.
                   EARTHQUAKE IN sussex.

                     of    few minutes before two o'clock     the               in

               a          earthquake was very generally felt
                          of                                                         at

                                                          at

                                                      it
 by any report, put both light and heavy furniture        tremor      in   a
for about four seconds       time.  of
                                     The floors seemed     heave           to

 :ages, &c., oscillated some seconds after the shock had subsided.
 There was no unusual appearance in the state of the sky, or
 about the sun at the time; but during the morning the sky
 had been filling with light clouds, and soon after the shock
 1 stratum of low electric clouds sprang up with the wind from
 ..he S. W., and the upper stratum changed from a grey to red
 and lake colours some time before the sun had set.          the                  If
  hock was not caused by the explosion of a meteor, it probably
 was the effect of the earth sinking somewhere in the southern
part of England, in consequence of the great quantity of rain
that has fallen during the last three months.       is now about It
twelve years since the last shock was felt here, which occurred
in the night, and was more violent than this one.
                                                               Chichester,   Dec. 8.
    The earthquake here on Monday was very alarming. Many

    * On Friday, January 7th, the bees were flying about in the garden of
Rose Mount.        Sunday the 9th resembled a day in March.              The sky was
without a cloud, there was scarcely a breath of wind, and in the country
in the morning the Blackbirds were singing as if welcoming the spring.
The pastures have a fine, fresh and healthy appearance, the wheat braird is
strong, thick in the ground, and nearly covers the soil. Vegetation is going
on in the gardens, and the usual spring flowers are making their appearance.

If  we compare this expression with the error of an original
observation, it will appear that the precision of A, the value
of the element found by the method of the least squares, is
to the precision of the actual observations, as h P to h, or as
P to 1. The probability that the true value of the element
is between the limits A(i+8) is equal to the integral

      is easy to transfer what has been proved with respect to

u, the error of A, to v and w, the errors of B and C. As the
solution we have given extends to three elements, it will ne
cessarily comprehend the subordinate cases of one and two
elements; and there is no difficulty, except the length of the
operations, of applying the same analysis to any number of
elements.        -              -                           -

it will     be sufficient for my purpose to quote                                   two authorities,
Haüy and Mr. Brochant: the former considered it as a rock,
and hence it has no place in his mineralogical method; and
by the latter it was (improperly) arranged (1819) as a sub
species of talc, under the name of Talc esquilleuw, i.e. scaly
or rather splintery Talc.
   From the difference of opinion with respect to the rank and
place which serpentine ought to hold in our mineralogical
systems, it is really a desideratum that   obscurity upon this           all
subject should          removed, serpentine being important from

     To the above description I have but a few observations to
 make; 1st. That no notice is taken of the cross fracture of
 the marmolite, which, in the fresh specimens, is important,

   The northern coast of Sicily, towards Cape Cefalu, after
bending to form the eastern part of the great bay included on
the west by the mountains to the left of Palermo, extends into
the sea towards Eolie (the Lipari islands), and presents, towards
them, a hollow front, the western part of which is formed by
Cape Orlando, and the eastern by Cape Calava. Places situated
about this bay suffered the most violent convulsions.                    Nato,
containing four thousand souls, and situated on an elevation,
was almost entirely laid waste, and a great number of private
houses destroyed; the monastery, hospital, the churches of St.
Peter, Anime del Purgatorio, St. Demetrius, and the cathedral,
were in a great measure overthrown.              The Quartiere del Sal
vadore suffered less: a transverse cleft was made in the earth,
and fears were entertained lest the whole elevation upon which
the city is built should be overthrown.                Only two persons
lost their  lives;   for the  people,   warned   by  a slight shock which
was felt some hours           before,   had               all

deep bays.       The extremity of this point constitutes at this day

the centre of the modern city. Matter, transported thither
by the water from the interior, and thrown up by the sea, to
  ether with the labour of men, has gradually filled up the
          spaces, and extended the peninsula with this trans
ported and alluvial earth, and formed the present soil. . It is
now composed in part of calcareous rock, and in part of mud
or alluvial earth; both are traversed by canals and large
conduits for the circulation of water for common use, and by

 The adjacent parts present a surface composed of calcareous
 tufa, and an earthy aggregate tender and friable; but deeper
down it is more                 and partly siliceous. The cheapness
of the tufa and the ease with which it is wrought have caused

100          On the Earthquakes                 in Sicily in March 1823.
    On the night of the 6th, at forty-five minutes past one, in
St. Lucia de Millazzo, six miles from the shore which looks
towards Volcano and Stromboli, a severe shock was felt; and
afterwards, at various intervals, horrible noises were heard,
                                                                  and
four distinct times, rumbling fearfully beneath them;
finally, at half past three o'clock, the shock was repeated. Both
were felt at Messina, but without any subterranean noises.
Nothing of it was felt at Palermo, or in any places in the west.
At fifty-six minutes past ten, in the night of the 7th, another
shock was felt at Palermo, sufficiently strong to put in motion
the pendulum of a small clock which            had stopped that       I                                I

pressed by the equation C = t (A, B), which is therefore true.
This is quite logical. It would be a waste of time to examine
Mr. Leslie's objections to the universality of the law of homo
geneity. They must have escaped him in a moment when his
eagerness to put down analysis (which he seems to consider
synonymous with mysticism) got the better of his natural quiet
apprehension of intellectual truth. They will be found suffi
ciently discussed in Baron Maurice's paper.              But he brings
forward an objection of a different character, which probably
deserves greater attention than it has met with.            He attempts
to deduce an    absurdity     by  the  employment     of similar reason
ing in a precisely similar case, and hence infers the fallacy of
the whole procedure.
   A triangle, says he, is determined by an angle and                                                       its   in

presents R, but of the abstract unit which measures the ratio
#. To        show the difficulties to which the French geometers
seem reduced in their attempts to gloss over this curious piece
of reasoning, let us quote one sentence from Maurice's dis
sertation.  After speaking of the trigonometrical equation

                        of carbonic acid. When it
 bered that the sources of the Vinagre are very hot, this opinion
  ought to have been abandoned.                      I
                                            boiled some water taken
                                  I

 acid taste and the same precipitates as in the unboiled water.

  At this period had very few re-agents left.
     The nitrate of silver" gave a white and milky precipitate,
 indicating the presence of muriates. The presence of iron was
 shown by the prussiate of lime, that of lime by the oxalate of
 potash. When the water was weighed with great care in the
 office of the mint of Popayan, the weight of an equal quantity
 of the water of the Vinagre was found to be to that of distilled
 water as 2735% gr. to 2731 gr.; that is to say, that the specific
 gravity of the water of the cascade was 1,0015.
    The waters which I describe, and of which M. Rivero has
 given the first analysis, must not be confounded with those of
 the two subterraneous lakes which we have found near the sum
mit of the volcano; one is 14,356 feet high, the other, above
º:
the snows, 15,475 feet. This volcano of Puracé is a dome of
semivitreous trachyte, of a blueish grey and having a conchoidal
fracture.    It does not present a great crater at            summit,            its

had already twice observed and described this phaenomenon, in
the mountains of Bareuth, and near Cracow, during a journey in
 Poland. Can it be admitted that the successive layers which are
added to the central nucleus are in a state of fluidity so great that
the rotary motion can cause the flattening of the spheroids?
    When the barometer indicated that we were come very near
the limit of perpetual snow, we found the masses of sulphur
disseminated in imperfectly columnar trachytic rocks aug
mented.        This phaenomenon struck me the more, as I knew
how rare sulphur is on the sides of inflamed volcanos:—a co
lumn of yellowish smoke and a frightful noise informed us of
the neighbourhood of one of the mouths (bocas) of the volca
no. We had some trouble to approach                   edge; the declivity        its
byofthe mountain being very steep, and the crevices only covered
a      crust       of

opening communicated with a basin full of boiling water.
The vapours which escape with so much violence are of the
sulphurous acid, which is indicated by their suffocating smell.
We shall soon see that the water of the subterraneous lake
is charged with sulphuretted hydrogen; but the odour of this
gas is not smelt at the summit of the volcano, because it is
disguised by the much stronger smell of the sulphurous acid
vapours.          I
                had not any means of determining the tempera
ture of these vapours, which seem to undergo a prodigiously
strong pressure in the interior of the volcano. As the Indians
  retend that the opening has several compartments which are
not all filled with water, and that the noise which is heard at
times in the interior of the crevice is the forerunner of flames,
 I introduced, by means of a long pole, some papers coloured
with the tincture of violet, under the vault, where I could be
sure of not touching the surface of the water. Drawing back
the pole, I found the papers strongly reddened, but not at                                         all

    The good curate of the village of Puracé thought to render
 a great   service to his parishioners, as well as to the inhabitants
of the town of Popayan, in causing, as he said, the chimneys
of the volcano to be cleaned now and then. He ordered the
 Indians to take away the crust of sulphur which rises in-form
 of a dome above the crevice. This crust has acquired some
 times, as they affirm, a thickness of as much as four feet in
less than two years.           It lessens without doubt the opening by
which the       vapours    of sulphurous acid escape; but it may be
conceived that the elastic force of these vapours is such that,
if the opening were entirely stopped up for some moments,
it would sooner break the new arch than produce commotions
by acting against the rocky sides of the volcano.                   For several
years the lakes, which represent in miniature the crater-lakes
of our extinguished volcanos, seem each to preserve the same
level of their line of water; which proves that the evaporation
is equal to the infiltration of the waters of snow and rain:
but this equilibrium has not always been equally steady.
 About the year 1790 the Boca grande caused partial inun
dations.      I   dwell on this phaenomenon, because it seems to
throw some light on a problem of the geology of volca
nos, which has not been sufficiently examined: I mean the
ejections of water and mud. At Vesuvius these ejections
are only apparent, and come neither from the interior of the
crater nor from the lateral crevices.                 An immense electric
tension manifests itself in the             atmosphere      which surrounds
the summit of the volcano at the time of great eruptions.
 Flashes of lightning cleave the air; the aqueous vapours
thrown out by the crater are cooled; thick clouds envelop the
summit during the continuance of this storm, confined to a
little space; the water descends in torrents, and is mixed with
the tufaceous substances which it drags with it". These ef
fects, purely meteorological, have given rise to the traditions
about boiling waters that issued from the crater of Vesuvius
   * M. de la Condamine (Mémoires de l'Académie 1754, p. 18) had already
expressed very precise ideas on the cause of these phaenomena, which are
found equally well explained in the Storia dell’ incendio del 1737, published

                     caused by the torrents of water from the side of Ottajano,
at the foot of Vesuvius.    They had transported into the plain, not only.
mud, but masses of lava 48 feet in circumference and 25 feet high. See

     In the volcanos of the Andes which exceed the limit of per
 petual snow, the causes           inundations are very different from
                                      of
 those which we have           just  indicated. As the eruptions                                     of
 these colossal summits take place only after long intervals
 (every thirty       forty years,

                                            or                           snow          of
 of an enormous thickness accumulate on the sides of the moun

  sterility over the plains for centuries. Muddy clays (lodazales)
  covered a space of more than four square leagues, when, in
 the night of the 19th of June 1698, the Peak of Carguai
 razo, the actual height of which exceeds 15,700 feet, sunk
 down with a noise.       The lakes of sulphureous water that we
  found at the summit of Puracé, explain what the inhabit
  ants of Quito report of the fetid smell of the waters which de
  scend sometimes from the sides of the volcanos during great
 eruptions.     Struck with the novelty of these phaenomena,
 which we     only mention here, the Spanish Conquistadores have,
 since the sixteenth century, distinguished two sorts of volca
 noes,—the fire volcanos and the water volcanos (volcanes de
Juego y de agua). This last denomination, which one might
 say was invented to bring near to each other the volcanists and
 the neptunists, and to put an end to the famous schism of
 dogmatical geology, has been applied especially to the moun
 tains of Guatimala and of the Archipelago of the Philippines.
 The Volcan de agua, placed between the volcano of Guatimala”
 and that of Pocaya, ruined, by torrents of water and stones
 which it sent forth the 11th of September 1541, the town of
 Almolonga, which is the ancient capital of the country. This
 mountain does not attain the limit of perpetual snow, but it
 remains covered with snow several months of the year. When
 we call to mind the confusion of the accounts that are found
 in our own days in the public papers of Europe, every time
 that Ætna or Vesuvius are in action, we cannot complain of
 the uncertainty in which the chroniclers of Spanish America
 and the Conquistadores of the sixteenth century leave us respect
 ing the phaenomena of volcanic inundations, so worthy of enga
 ging the attention of natural philosophers. During the eruption
Sºma        in 1792, there opened on the declivity of the volcano,
 3 miles from the crater, a gulf+ from which issued for se

  It is easily conceivable that, in the equinoctial zone, even very
 low mountains may by a particular disposition of their sub
 terraneous cavities, and by the excessive abundance of the
 tropical rains, be subject to cause frightful inundations each
  time that they undergo shocks of earthquakes. Furthermore,
 the phaenomena which we have been describing are repeated
 from time to time far from the volcanos, in secondary moun
 tains, in the centre of Europe.               Sad examples have proved
 in our   days   that in the     Alps   of  Switzerland,      where no shocks
 of  earthquakes     are  felt,  a  simple    hydrostatic     pressure    lifts up
 and breaks with violence banks of               rock,    throwing     them to a
 great distance, as if they were projected by elastic forces.
     The trachytes of Puracé contain sulphur like those of Mont
 Dore in Auvergne, of Budoshegy in Transylvania, of the
 Isle of Montserrat in the Little Antilles, and of the Anti
 sana in the Andes of Quito.               It is still formed daily in the
 clefts around the     gulfs    of  Puracé,    either by a very slow subli
 mation, or by the contact of the sulphurous acid vapours
 with the sulphuretted hydrogen of the lake. The volcano la
 bours in       its
                interior like the solfataras; but             presents nothing

Here then is repeated on a small scale, in the clefts of a primitive
rock, the phaenomena of the trachytic solfatara of Budoshegy
in Transylvania, which has been recently examined by M.
Boué.      The micaceous schist of Quindiu, which surrounds the
open veins, is decomposed, and the sulphur is formed in masses
considerable enough to become the object of a sulphur-work
which supports a family settled in the ravine of the Azufral.
The rock contains some decomposed pyrites; but                    I much
doubt whether these pyrites perform the important part in
nature which has been so long ascribed to them in geological
treatises.    In the midst of the granitic rocks of Quindiu rise
the trachytes of the volcano of Tolima, a truncated cone, which
reminds us of the form of the Cotopaxi, and which, according
to a geodesic measurement made by me at the west of Ibagué,
is the highest summit of the Andes in the northern hemi
spheref. A rivulet which emits considerably the smell of
sulphuretted hydrogen descends from the Peak of Tolima,
and proves that the trachytes which have penetrated the
§.ranitic rocks also contain sulphur.

some specimens to the cabinet of the Ecole des Mines at Paris,
which contains the most complete and instructive series of geo
ynosticspecimens. Following the Cordillera of the Andes south
 wards, these same alternations of primitive formations and of
 porphyritic and trachytic regions are found:—but what was my
                                         I
 surprise, when beyond the equator ascertained that the cele
 brated mountain of sulphur of Ticsan (S. lat. 2° 10'), between
 Quito and Cuenca, is neither composed of trachyte, nor of
 chalk or of gypsum, but of micaceous schist.
    This mountain of sulphur, which the Indians call Quello, is
 situated, according to my barometric measurement, at the
 height of 8000 feet above the level of the ocean.           It is entirely
 composed of primitive micaceous schist (glimmerschiefer),
 which is not even anthracitic, as are the varieties of this rock
 peculiar to transition countries.      In some very deep ravines.
 between Ticsan and Alausi, the micaceous schist is seen rest
 ing on gneiss. The sulphur is contained in a stratum of quartz
 which is more than 1200 feet thick: it lies in a tolerably re
 gular direction N. 18° E., and inclined like the micaceous

which passes sometimes into the hornstone, is wrought in an
open working.      The declivity of the Cerro Quello, on which
the works were begun some centuries since, is opposite to
the south-south-east; and the bed of quartz appears to be
prolonged towards the north-north-west, that is to say, to
wards the coast of the Pacific Ocean.    It is however asserted
that sulphur   has not been found on the surface of the

 end of the eighteenth century, masses of sulphur were still
worked, which were from 2 to 3 feet in diameter. At present
they are working some quartzose strata much less rich, in
which the sulphur is only dispersed in nodules from 3 to 4
inches thick.      It is observed that the quantity of sulphur                     in
creases with the depth; but the working has been so unskil
fully directed that the lower strata are nearly inaccessible.
The quartz in which the sulphur is dispersed presents neither
great fissures nor cavities, or druses; nor have I been able
to find any specimen of crystallized sulphur.
   The mineral which is the object of the working of the Cerro
 Quello does not form a mass or complication of veins, as might
be supposed : the sulphur is disseminated without any con
tinuity by little masses in the quartz which traverses              mi       §.

of Ticsan which I     have made known, leaves no further doubt
respecting the existence of sulphur in the primitive districts.
It has also been lately found in Brazil, that the chloritic
  uartz formation which covers, in the Capitania de Minas
   eraes, the primitive clay-slate, contains both gold and sul
phur.     Laminae of this rock strongly heated burn with a
blue flame.      Near to Villarica, in the district called Antonio
Pereira, a schist, of the same age as that on which is super
posed the itacolumite or chloritic quartz, contains a calca
reous bed traversed by veins of quartz, which the Baron d’Esch
wege (director of the gold and diamond mines of these coun
tries) has found filled with little nodules of pulverulent sulphur.
All these phaenomena increase in interest, when we reflect that
this learned geologist, and also another German traveller
(M. Pohl) incline to the opinion that gold, micaceous iron, dia
monds, euclases, platina, and palladium, which are peculiar
to the alluvial districts of Brazil, have been derived either from
the destruction of the great formation of chloritic quartz, or
from that of a ferruginous bed (itabarite) which is placed above
this formation.

by Bergman, but differing considerably in the proportions.

of plants from which the indigo is extracted in different parts
of the world.
     It is
        to be understood that the part called pure indigo is
the sole colouring matter, and that which gives value to the
article. The rest may be considered as dross, doing no good,
and being probably harmless to the use of the drug as a dye,
but scarcely so to the printer, who meets with obstructions
enough in the exercise of his art, without introducing such as

may easily be avoided.                     -
  When we consider, however, that indigo is produced by a
        of fermentation from vegetable matter, analogous to
 the vinous and acetous fermentation of saccharine matter, it is
not improbable that the fermentation in many cases may be
incomplete. And as the foreign matter found in the indigo
 of commerce is chiefly vegetable, and composed of the same
 elements as pure indigo, it may by a fresh fermentation de
velop more of the pure indigo than is found in it originally.
 This conjecture is countenanced by the practice of dyers, who,
 when the indigo is nearly spent, as the phrase               put      other              is,         in

       in this state for oxygen, that it resumes it from atmo
spheric air the moment they are brought into contact.
    Pure indigo thus obtained is called precipitated indigo: the
solution may also be had from a blue-dyer's vat by plunging
an empty phial into the liquid a few inches below the surface.
    The other way of obtaining pure indigo is by sublimation.
Take 20 or 30 grains of pulverized common indigo and place
it in an iron spoon, which must be gradually heated to 500° or
600°Fahrenheit. A purple smoke will then exhale copiously,
and at the same time a fine tissue of small, shining, silky
needles will start up on the surface of the indigo.       These may
be withdrawn      by the point of a knife;  they are  crystals of sub
limed indigo.

    Precipitated and sublimed indigo appear by the chemical
tests to be constituted of the same elements; and no doubt is
entertained that they present the pure colouring matter of

     We       now proceed to the consideration                       of the best     means        of
fixing a comparative value upon the different samples of the
indigo of commerce.    After numerous trials I find the method
first suggested by Descroisille to judge of the strength of oxy
 muriatic acid to be preferred.                   The objects indeed are dif
 ferent, but the operations are analogous: he made use of a
 given solution of indigo to ascertain the comparative strengths
 of various solutions containing oxymuriatic acid; on the other
          I
 hand, propose to use a solution of oxymuriatic acid of known
 strength, to compare the relative quantities of pure indigo              -        in
 different samples.

 of oxymuriatic acid, in solutions of oxymuriate of lime, not by
 solutions of indigo, which must be variable from the quality

 precision to show the real quantity of oxymuriatic acid in so
 lutions.
    For example: I took a graduated tube of capacity equal to
 300 grains of water; I filled it with pure nitrous gas, and
 then transferred it to a cup of the liquid oxymuriate, valued
 above by the sulphate of iron.            After repeated agitation, co
 vering the end of the tube carefully with my finger,                    soon             I
 had 100 measures of       liquid   in the tube: then    withdrawing     it to
a cup of water I agitated repeatedly, letting in water each time,
instead of oxymuriate of lime, because I was aware that the
 100 measures already in the tube were not saturated.                   Soon
after, the process was at an end, no more nitrous gas being
absorbed. The 100 measures of the oxymuriate took 168
measures of nitrous gas to saturate them. Now deducting one
sixteenth of this for the nitrous gas impregnating the liquid,
and for loss occasioned by the free oxygen gas in the water
which the nitrous gas had to combine with, there will remain
 157 nitrous gas = -2 grain weight, which was converted into
nitric acid; but if we deduct one-eighth part from the weight
of nitrous gas, we shall have the weight of oxygen requisite
to convert it into nitric acid = 175 parts of a grain; only
differing rººrg from the other valuation by sulphate of iron.
    To find the value of any sample of indigo, I take one grain
carefully weighed from a mass finely pulverized.                  I put this
into a small glass, a wine-glass for example; then by a drop
                I
ping tube put two or three grains of concentrated sulphuric
acid upon            The two principles are next well mixed to

nearly the same results.     Each of these required 140 grains
of the  oxymuriate  of lime solution, corresponding to 25 parts
of a  grain of oxygen.     The yellow  liquid obtained was 3600

grains.
   2.—Flora indigo, one grain, required 70 of the oxymuriate
 ="125 parts of a grain of oxygen, or one half of the other.
   The same result from a sample marked J. R. best.
   3.—Indigoes marked 1 P and 3 P required about 60 of the
oxymuriate.
   4.—Those marked J. R. middle, J. R. worst, and 4 P, re
quired about 50 oxymuriate.
   5.—That marked Wood was rather inferior to the above,
but required above 40 oxvinuriate.
   6.—Those marked 2 P and 1194 were the lowest I have
examined; one grain of each did not require more than 30
oxymuriate, or 35 at the most.      A poor turbid yellow liquor
was produced. The sample 2 P, when burned, yielded about
 30 per cent of fine sand.
   Upon a review of these experiments, I am persuaded that
to destroy indigo by oxymuriatic acid, twice the quantity of
oxygen is necessary that is required to revive it from the lime
solution.
     I
     hope the subject here taken up will not be considered as
unimportant, when we are informed that the article indigo
imported into this country annually, about fifteen years ago,
amounted in value to upwards of two millions of pounds ster
ling; and it much exceeds that sum in              all

   4. One writer recommends a series of explosions with gun
powder. This is very crude. It would indeed be possible
to gain some power by creating a vacuum in front of the ma
chine, and by impelling the air drawn from the front through
a pipe, to rush out behind. This might be effected by con
necting the centre of the pipe with a tube and piston. In
                                            ...;
raising the piston, the air will rush through the pipe from the
front, while it is prevented by a valve from passing in through
the other part; on                      the piston, the air is impelled
 through the pipe behind, while another valve prevents                     re                                         its

134                         Obituary:-Dr. Tilloch.
      THE LATE ALEXANDER TILLOCH, LL.D.
      It is with
              feelings of deep emotion that we have to announce
 to our readers the death of a gentleman with whose name
 and talents they have long been acquainted—Dr. Alexander
 Tilloch, the founder and editor of the Philosophical Maga
 zine, the second monthly periodical work wholly devoted to
 scientific subjects published in this country; the first having
 been Mr. Nicholson's Philosophical Journal, which some years
 since merged into this work.
     We have neither the leisure nor would our feelings permit
 us to do justice to the memory of our late much-esteemed
 friend and coadjutor; we shall however lose no time in pre
 paring such a Memoir of him as his character and talents
 demand, and which will be given in a future Number of the
 Philosophical Magazine:–our present notice therefore can
 only be considered as a brief obituary.
     Alexander Tilloch was a native of Glasgow, where he was
 born on the 28th of February 1759.      After receiving that         li
 beral education which in Scotland is so much more accessible
 than in England, inured from his earliest life to a habit of
 thinking for himself, possessing an inquisitive mind, and im
 bibing an ardent thirst for knowledge, he devoted much of
 his attention to the art of printing, in which he conceived much
 improvement remained to be made.           As he was not bred a
 printer himself, he had recourse to Mr. Foulis, printer of the
 University of Glasgow, to whom he applied for types to make
 an experiment in a new process, and that nothing less than
 the art of stereotype printing: the experiment succeeded, and
 Mr. Foulis, who was a very ingenious man, became so con
 vinced of         its
                practicability and excellence, that             he
                                                            entered
 into partnership   with him     order
                                    in     carryto on.
                                                     it  They   took
 out patents       both England and Scotland, and printed se
                     in
 veral small volumes from stereotype plates.        few years after
                                                      A
 wards Dr. Tilloch discovered that although               he
                                                       had invented
 stereotype printing, yet           he
                                 was but     second
                                                 a    inventor,  and

  did not  disgust Dr. Tilloch,  made him think less     his disof
  covery; and soon after      lefthe
                                   Glasgow for London, where              he
 became one         of   the proprietors    the Star evening newspaper:

    but even the avocations                         of    a daily       journal, and the political
 vortex into which          connected with  all     are unavoidably               it
 driven, could not divert his mind from                favourite pur                       its

  Coleoptera are typically pentamerous; that the tarsal system

    The fresh-water formations described in this communication
have been examined by means of several wells sunk at about
the distance of three-quarters of a mile and a mile and a half
from the Mediterranean, near Sete, in the South of France.
     A detailed account is given of the several strata passed
through in the three different wells, and of the organic re
mains which they contained.                         -
    The strata are for the - most part parallel and nearly hori
zontal.
    From the sections it appears there are two fresh-water
formations with an intervening formation of marine origin.
The strata of the upper fresh-water were found to vary from
about 30 to 40 feet in thickness; those of the lower from 13
to 28 feet: the latter being sometimes lower than the present
level of the Mediterranean.
    The marine beds which are interposed, are from 10 to 11
feet thick.
    The fresh-water strata are composed of numerous alternat
ing calcareous and argillaceous marls, and compact limestones;
and their organic remains consist of a few bones of land qua
drupeds much decayed, a variety of fresh-water and terrestrial
shells, the latter in the greatest abundance; the shells differ
 ing in species but not in genera from the present inhabitants
of the same country; and lastly, some traces of vegetables,
 chiefly reeds.
    The marine formations contain ostrea, cerithia, &c.    :-A
complete list is added of the organic remains:—from the state
 of preservation in which the fresh-water shells are found,
 Mons. Marcel de Serres infers that they lived and were de
posited where they are now found; and from the resemblance
of those occurring in the upper and lower fresh-water beds,
 he concludes that the periods at which these two formations
 were deposited were not very remote from each other.
    The author considers all these formations to be more re
 cent than the Calcaire Grossiere, and ascribes the alternations
 of marine and fresh-water strata to a return of the sea; such
 a suppostion being rendered the more probable by the neigh
 bourhood of the Mediterranean, where similar returns are still
 known to take place.

and roots; others to the reduction and comparison of weights
and measures, whether British or foreign, and to the forma
tion of a general system; and others he rendered applicable
to the rules of mensuration and to still higher inquiries annong
mathematicians.
   “In the pursuit of these researches he developed various in
teresting properties indicative of the mutual connexion be
tween circulating decimals and prime numbers, entering either
simply or compositely into the denominators of fractions re
spectively equivalent to those decimals; of which properties
some have been long known to mathematicians, while others
had almost, if not altogether, escaped their notice.     A few of
these are  explained  in the Appendix    to the quarto  pamphlet
to which this paper is attached *; and in that appendix one
of Mr. Goodwyn's ingenious improvements in computation is
 described and applied.
   “The resultsof his persevering and long-continued labours,

                     NEWLY-DISCOVERED    ISLAND.
   A   new island in the Southern Ocean was discovered last
July by Capt. Hunter, of the Donna Carmelita. It is de
scribed as “entirely composed of lava, in some places almost
a metal.     It lies in the latitude of 15° 31 S.; and longitude
176° 11 E. by sun and moon, brought up by chronometer for
four days previous.” It is called Onacuse, or Hunter's Island.
The inhabitants, who came off in canoes, manifested a friendly
disposition; and the cutter was sent ashore in charge of the
first officer, who had an interview with the king, and trafficked
with the natives on very friendly terms for provisions. They
are about the colour of Malays, but have more of the Euro
pean features.      Their canoes are very handsome, not unlike
those of   Ceylon,   and ornamented with shells.
             ExPEDITION FROM MISSOURI TO MExICO.
    A statement of facts has been lately presented to Congress
from Mr. Augustus Storrs, of New Hampshire, in relation to
the origin, present state, and future prospect of trade and      in
tercourse between the Valley of the Mississippi and the inter
nal provinces of Mexico, which was ordered to be printed and
                                       .
referred.
    Mr. S. has been one of a caravan of eighty persons, 156
horses, and 23 waggons and carriages, which had made the
expedition from Missouri to Santa Fé (of New Mexico), in May
and June last.      His account was full of interest and novelty.
It sounded like romance to hear of caravans of men, horses,
and waggons, traversing with their merchandize the vast plain
which lies between the Mississippi and the Rio del Norte. The .
story seemed better adapted to Asia than to North America.
 But, romantic as it might seem, the reality had already ex
ceeded the visions of the wildest imagination.     The journey to
 New Mexico, but lately deemed a                  project, had be
come an affair of ordinary occurrence. Santa Fé, but lately
the Ultima Thule of American enterprise, was now considered
p.
as a stage only in the progress, or rather a new point of de
           to our invincible citizens.   Instead of turning back
 rom that point, the caravans broke up there, and the sub
                                                          divisions

                                  Rail-Roads.                              143
  divisions branched offin different directions in search of new
  theatres for their enterprise.       Some proceeded down the river
  to the Passo del Norte, some to the mines of Chihuahua and
  Durango, in the province of New Biscay; some to Sinera and
  Sinatoa, on the Gulf of California; and some, seeking new
  lines of communication with the Pacific, had undertaken to
  descend the western slope of our continent through the unex
  plored regions of the Multnomah and Buenaventura.                       The
  fruit of this  enterprise,   for the  present  year,   amounted to one
  hundred and ninety thousand dollars in gold and silver bullion,
  and coin, and precious furs; a sum considerable in itself in
  the commerce of an infant state, but chiefly deserving a
  statesman's notice, as an earnest of what might be expected
  from a regulated and protected trade. The principal article
  given in exchange is that of which we have the greatest abun
  dance, and which has the peculiar advantage of making the
.  circuit of the Union before it departs from the territories of
  the Republic—cotton, which grows in the south, is manufac
  tured in the north, and exported from the west.
                               RAIL-ROADS.
      On a well made road a horse will draw a load of one ton,
  in a cart weighing 7 cwt. at the rate of two miles an hour—
                                         º
  (Leslie's Elements, p. 253). The whole strength of the horse
  is exerted in overcoming the friction.         On such a road, there
  fore, a force of traction of 100 pounds moves a weight of
  3,000 pounds, or the friction is 1-30th part of the load (the
  cart included).
      On a rail-way of the best construction it has been shown in
  a former paper, that a horse                       at the same rate of
  two miles an hour draws 15 tons, including the vehicles.                  In
  this case then a power of traction of 100 pounds moves a
  weight of 33,600 pounds; the friction of course is 1-336th part
  —or in round numbers 1-300th part of the load.
      On a canal, a horse travelling at two miles an hour draws
  80 tons in a boat weighing probably 15 tons".               Reducing the
  ton to 2,000 pounds for the sake of round numbers, as in the
  last calculation, we find here that a power of traction of 100
  pounds moves a mass of 90,000 pounds—or the resistance
  which the water opposes to the motion of the vessel is equal to
  1-900th part of the load or entire weight. At sea, where the
  water-way is of unlimited breadth, the resistance is probably
  one-third less; but as a compensation for this, when steam
     * Boats in some cases carry only 15 or 20 tons, in others 35 (as the
  coal boats on the Union Canal); but in the one case they travel quicker,kand
  ºn others slower, than the rate mentioned.
                                                                      power

power is employed, there is probably a loss                                                   of one-third in
consequence            of the disadvantageous                          mode         of       its   application.
     We  see then that the effect produced        the draught                       by                               of

   Hence we see that when we have to contend with the re
sistance of water, a great increase of power produces but a
small increase of velocity. To make a ship sail three times
faster, for instance, we must employ nine times the power; and
to make her sail six times faster, we must employ no less than
thirty-six times the power. Let us suppose, for example, that
it were required to determine, since one horse draws a boat
loaded with thirty tons at two miles an hour, how many horses
would draw the same boat at four miles.             We find, first, that
since the boat is to move two times as fast, it will require four
times the absolute amount of power, or 400 pounds.                   But a
horse   moving   at four miles an    hour,  pulls   only   with a force of
64 pounds.       Of course, it would require six horses to exert a
power of 400 pounds, and move the boat at the rate proposed.
    Let us now see what amount of power will produce corre
sponding effects upon a rail-way.          And before we make more
particular inquiry,          let suppose that the retardation occa

             friction, instead       increasing       the square

ratio  of the velocity.    We have seen, then, that               force                                                                           a           of

      Hence we see that, though a moving force of 100 pounds
 produces three times as great an effect upon a canal as upon
 a rail-way at 2 miles an hour, this superiority of the water con
 veyance is lost if we adopt a velocity at 6 miles an hour; and
 at    all greater velocities the same expenditure                 power will         of
 produce        greater effect upon rail-way, than upon
                a                                a                      canal,                 a               a

     This calculation proceeds              the hypothesis that the friction
increases          the simple ratio
                  in                         the velocity. Such was the

                                       in   a                                                                  of

four    times,   the friction    will       be
                                          nearly,  but not  quite, four times
                          -

a   small       greater surface; but

                                  of
but not      precisely,     the same law             velocity; and that law

is only the resistance of the air (increasing as the square of
the velocity) that prevents this indefinite acceleration and ulti
mately renders the motion uniform.
   Secondly. Setting aside, again, the resistance of the air (the
effects of which we shall estimate by and by), the very same
amount of constant force which impels a car on a rail-way at
2 miles an hour, would impel it at 10 or 20 miles an hour if an
extra force were employed at first to overcome the inertia of
the car and generate the required velocity.        Startling as this
proposition may appear, it is an indisputable and necessary
consequence of the laws of friction.        In fact, assuming that
the resistance of the air were withdrawn, if we suppose a
horizontal rail-way made round the globe, and the machine
(supplied with a power exactly equivalent to the friction) to be
placed on the rail-way, and launched by an impulse with any
determinate velocity, it would revolve for ever with the velo
city so imparted, and be in truth a sort of secondary planet to
our globe.
   Now, it would be at                 all
                               times easy (as we shall afterwards
show)     toconvert this accelerated motion into       uniform mo–  a
tion  of any  determinate   velocity;  and from the nature         the             of
resistance,    high velocity would cost almost
                a                                      little, and  as                   be

the construction of the new bushel measure, I am further               di
rected to submit to you, for the consideration of the Lords
Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury, the propriety of
bringing in a Bill, immediately after the meeting of Parlia
ment, to extend the time fixed by the Act of last Session for
 carrying the provisions of the said Act into execution.
    As Capt. Kater now confidently hopes that the models will
be completed and deposited at the Exchequer in the course of
 the month of February, the Commissioners are of opinion,
that if the period at which the new weights and measures are
 to be declared to be the only standards was postponed from
the 1st of May 1825 (the day fixed by the Act of last Session),
to the 1st of January 1826, sufficient time would be afforded
for providing th? inodels of the standard weights and measures
required for the several counties and corporations of the United
 Kingdom, and for carrying into effect such of the enactments
 of the said Act as are preliminary to the general establishment
 of the new standards.
                  I
                  have the honour to be,
                       Your obedient humble servant,

   Having been requested to superintend the construction of
the new models of
                       yº.      and measures, (and very unexpected
delays having taken place in their execution,)        I    beg to offer
a short report of the progress which has been made, and of
the impediments which have occurred.
   On the 16th August, the making of the models of weight
and capacity was confided to Mr. Bate, Mr. Troughton, in
consequence of his advanced age, having declined the under
taking.    Brass being a metal peculiarly liable to injury from
the atmosphere of London,          Idirected Mr. Bate to make ex
periments on the best combination of         tin   and copper, which
might serve   as
              a     substitute.    These   experiments    occupied the
remainder    of the month     of August.
   In  the beginning     ofSeptember    I  left London, having pre
              º
viously given Mr. Bate ample and detailed instructions re
specting every particular necessary for the construction          ofthe
models.
                                              -
    On my return, early       in October,I     learned from Mr. Bate
that he had                Mr. Donkin the beginning           Septem
                                                          to of
                         to
ber, and that Mr. Donkin had then undertaken                   turn the
models for the bushel; but         on  the 5thof    October, and not
before, he informed Mr. Bate that he declined the execution
of  his engagement.     Mr. Bate then proceeded      to   have models
for  the bushel  cast   bythe  best founders  in   London;    but most
  --                                 -
                                                         unexpectedly

unexpectedly, out of twelve which were cast in various modes,
only one proved sufficiently sound to be employed, the metal,
on the removal of the exterior crust, appearing full of small
holes, of various sizes. The attempt to conquer the difficulties
of this part of the work occupied the remainder of Octo
ber, the whole of November, and the greater part of Decem
ber.      In   the mean time                   Mr. Bate proceeded with                            the other
measures of capacity and with the weights; but as these                                                     pre
sented no difficulties, his chief attention was directed to                                                 per
fecting the bushel.
   Two troy pounds were made, which compared, on the                           I
28th October, with the standard troy pound at Mr. Whittam's,
in Abingdon-street.    These weights were intended merely as
the means of obtaining a near approximation to the avoirdu
pois pound, and to the weight of a gallon of distilled water.
   On the 20th of December, Mr. Bate reported that he had
six avoirdupois pounds ready,        the troy weights, and the to all
subdivisions            of
                the troy pound      grains.
    Ithad been my intention        ascertain the capacity  to
                                                            the                                         of

did not appear probable that the difficulties       casting the                          in

Whitehall Treasury Chambers, Feb. 4, 1825.
 ON THE AGENCY OF PLATINA IN EFFECTING THE FORMATION
                      OF WATER.
  If in  a tube closed at one end ammonia-muriate of platina
is heated till completely decomposed, or if a solution of platina
is treated with metallic zinc, part of the inside of this tube be
comes covered with a thin coat of platina which adheres to it
rather strongly.       If
                        afterwards a mixture of hydrogen and
oxygen is made to pass under water, into this tube, the com
bination of the two gases is slowly effected at a moderate tem
perature. The phaenomenon also takes place when these
gases are put in contact with spongy platina moistened with
water or with alcohol.        If
                              we try to substitute liquid ammo
nia or nitric acid for the water or alcohol, the gases no longer
act upon each other. M. Doebereiner thinks that this dif
ference of effects is to be ascribed to the water or alcohol
absorbing the gaseous mixture, and thus effecting immediate
contact with the platina, which does not take place with the
ammonia or nitric acid. By using vessels covered inside with
 latina, the hydrogen may be completely deprived of oxygen.
   owever, it succeeds still better by putting it in contact, in
very dry eudiometers, under mercury, with a porous ball form
ed of clay and of platina newly calcined.       M. Doebereiner
describes a simple apparatus      for determining with care the
formation       water by means
               of                  of fit

   N. B. The barometer is hung up in the observatory 50 feet
above the low-water mark of Portsmouth Harbour; and the
self-registering horizontal day and night thermometer, and De
Luc's whalebone hygrometer, are placed in open-worked cases,
in a northern aspect, out of the rays of the sun, 10 feet above
the garden ground.       The pluviameter and evaporator have
respectively the same square area: the former is emptied every
morning at 8 o'clock after rain, into a cylindrical glass gauge
accurately graduated to Tºoth of an inch; and the quantity
lost by evaporation from the latter is ascertained at least every
third day, and sometimes oftener, when great evaporations
happen by means of a high temperature and dry northerly or
easterly winds.
   BARoMETRICAL PREssure.—The maximum pressure was
higher this year by ºth of an inch than it was in 1823, and the
minimum pressure was less by gºth of an inch.         The mean
pressure this year is gºths of an inch less than that of last
year, but it
              #.     with the mean pressure for the last 10 years
within Tºonths of an inch. . The aggregate of the spaces de
scribed by the alternate rising and falling of the mercury is
33 inches greater than that of last year; and the number of
changes is 21 more.—For 173 days in which the moon ranged
in North declination, the mean pressure was 33rths of an inch
#.       than that in the 183 days in which she ranged in South
  eclination.

thus annul the idea of the existence of a superior pressure by
the Moon's influence in either hemisphere.           am supported              I
in this  opinion  from similar observations     having  been made
by Luke Howard, Esq., F.R.S., in the years 1807 and 1816;
as in both these years the mercury in his barometer is said to
have been nearly as high again as the above resulting differ
ence, while the moon was in south declination.—At some future
time more may be said on this subject.
   TEMPERATURE.-The mean temperature of the external
air a few feet from the ground this year is 11% of a degree
more than that of 1823, and is ºths of a degree higher than
the mean temperature for the last eight years.-Although July
was the hottest month, yet the marimum temperature did not
take place till the 3rd of September: it has not occurred so
late in the summer as this since the year 1815, and very ge
nerally takes place in June, when the sun is nearly at his
greatest north declination, before or after entering the sign
 Cancer.
   From the great quantity of rain that has fallen this year,
and the abundant floating vapours, the strength of the sun’s
rays on the surface of the earth seems to have been diminish
ed; for the mean temperature of spring water has fallen short
of   its
       yearly average, and for the last four years         A.M.
                                                                                    of at

           of
            a                                            the air for
the same period.
   The mean state        the hygrometer this and the preceding
                                of
year coincides within three-tenths                         of
                                          degree; and the means  a
of the observations thereon        o'clock A.M.,  at   8both years,                in
exactly agree.

   By  these curious results, we find that the cumulus and cu
mulostratus approximate nearest in number: the former is a
fair-weather cloud, and evaporates at or soon after sunset when
the atmosphere is not in a humid state; the latter is generally
a.
              of an approaching change in the state of the at
mosphere. Next to these, the cirrus and nimbus approximate
nearest in number: the cirri are precursors                  and very ge           of,

         On the Method of the Least Squares.                  By  J. Ivory,  Esq.

4.   A DMITTING             the expression            4 (e") for the probability
         of an error, we may both              demonstrate the rule of the
least squares, and determine the form                  of the function, by the
following short process:
   Let P stand for the product,
                    p  (e”).    4 (e^*).   4 (e”) &c.;
then the most probable system             of the errors will         be found by  .
the equations which make Pa maximum, viz.
                    d P               d P
                                0,
                    da: =             +      = 0, &c.
Now, n being the number of the errors, we have
                                       log.    P.

Theory, we must choose in the general expressions those partl
cular cases only that are capable of being applied practically,
and that are not too complicated for real use. The calcula

of  the foregoing equations which are    one dimension with

might not be found altogether devoid of truth, if we were to
affirm that, in the present times, the voice of authority has a
more decisive influence in that science than in any other. It
is so much easier to approve or disapprove on the credit of a
few great names, than it is to find the skill and the patience
requisite to examine a knotty point of abstract science.

preponderancy may be estimated by the distance, from the

common fulcrum, of the centre of gravity of the weights hang
ing from their new points of suspension. But whatever the
supposed variations are, it will be admitted that the errors
       undergo opposite variations, so as to acquire an equal
and   contrary preponderancy; and it is obvious that the system
of the least  squares   is an exact mean between the two oppo
site systems.     We cannot therefore but conclude that the
system in which the sum of the squares is a minimum, which
occupies the mean place among               the possible systems,              all                                         is   .

   In  conclusion, it may not perhaps be improper to assign
the reason why the analysis of Laplace coincides exactly with
the particular law of probability.        It arises from the approxi
mation   employed    by  the French    geometer;   according to which
the squares    only of the errors are retained in the expressions of
the probabilities, the higher powers being dismissed.        There is
thus the most perfect agreement between the results obtained
both ways; a convincing proof, in point of fact, that the two
methods are fundamentally the same, and are different            only

XXVI.      An Account of the Earthquakes which occurred in Sicily
   in March 1823.          By Sig. Abate FERRARA, Professor of
   Natural Philosophy in the University of Catania, &c. &c.
                         [Concluded  from p. 100.]
                        Physical Observations.
               the people about AEtna perceived their houses be
WHEN    ginning to shake, they turned their eyes towards the
volcano, and waited in expectation of an immediate eruption.
And while they looked, fearful apprehensions filled their minds,
and they prayed that the event, be it what it would, might
take place at once.
   The philosopher, who observes the phaenomena of nature
for the sake of reducing to the same class those of an analo
gous origin, and thence to deduce them from the same cause,
observes the link which connects earthquakes with volcanic
operations, and sees with the ignorant vulgar those mighty
forces preparing in the subterranean furnace, which are able
to put in motion immense masses of the solid globe, and to
agitate them as water is agitated by a violent wind.             The
eruption of Ætna in 1811 was interesting from the grandeur of
the spectacle which it presented, and no less so from the         in
struction which it conveyed to the naturalist.           A new, open
ing was made on the surface of the mountain. Explosions of
tremendous force preceded the emission of immense columns
of smoke and inflamed masses of matter, which were inces
santly belched out towards heaven, and whose approach was
announced by horrid roarings and explosions which filled the
air to a great distance.       Each explosion was accompanied by
shocks; and as the interval between them was but of a few
minutes duration, the city and country to a vast extent were
in a continued undulation.         For many days at Catania, eigh
                                                                 teen

                     which occurred in                      Sicily in March 1823.                              169
  teen miles distant, we were rocked as though we had been
  upon the sea. Some of the shocks were very violent. The

  tinued beating against              side posts.       The shocks lasted                                       as
 long      as
            the volcano was           operation;      and when the external
  phaenomena disappeared, the internal fire not being yet ex
 tinguished, deep subterranean rumblings and explosions were
 heard, and shocks felt            each report.

phaenomena were unlucky omens to these unhappy towns. At

     Since September    of last  year  the  daily quantity  of smoke
 from Vulcano has been much greater than usual, and flame
 has often been visible in the evening.        Explosions have been
 frequently heard on the neighbouring coasts of Sicily. But
 Stromboli has exhibited the greatest activity for almost four
 teen months without intermission.          Shocks have been very
 frequent, and so strong as to fill the islanders, although ac
 customed to them, with great apprehensions. The island, with
 the blazing mountain itself, seemed often on the point of being
 torn up from its foundation.        The volcano opened two new
 mouths on the side which looks towards the sea, and belched
 out from them fearful clouds of sand and burning rocks, which
 after darkening the air fell to the earth.        Fortunately their
 direction was not towards     any  of the little habitations or cul
 tivated fields of the island.      One forest only on the side of
 the mountain suffered some injury.           The inhabitants often
 found themselves enveloped in thick clouds of black smoke
 and ashes, which the wind drove among them.

 mage to the cisterns of the island, and to the terraces which
 serve as tiles over them.    Torrents of black smoke, ashes and
 sand were often   ejected and thrown to various distances.      The
    eatest shocks were sometimes followed by a thick dry cloud
 which filled the air of the whole island.
    The shock of the 5th of March was very strong at Strom
 boli, at Saline (formerly Didime), and at Lipari. The inhabi
 tants of Lipari did not doubt that their houses would this time
 be reduced to ruins; and they have not yet ceased giving
 thanks to Heaven and their protecting saints for defending
 them from utter destruction. They affirm that a moment after
 the shock     alltheir thoughts were turned upon the disasters

of this lecture was published in Felix Farley's Journal (a

 the electric and acted on by the magnetic fluids revolved
upon        its

THE   various journeys which have recently been made into
  the interior of Sumatra have considerably extended our
hitherto very imperfect knowledge of the geography of that
island, and have also furnished materials for a slight outline
of   itsgeological structure. Some account                 the information   of

 the two southernmost branches of this river pass, abound in
        which has latterly been chiefly exported to Moco Moco,
   encoolen, and Palembang.
    At Bencoolen the line of hills is situated about twenty miles
inland; and the space between them and the sea exhibits a
succession of ridges and ravines, whose general direction is
parallel to the coast, though frequently altered and broken by
the irregular working of springs and streams.                The hills are
principally of the trap formation, and exhibit several varieties
of basalt, whinstone, and much of the same gray amygdaloidal
trap observed in the neighbourhood of Padang.                    The most
remarkable hill in this quarter is detached from the Barrier
range, and is called Gunong Bungko, or by Europeans the
 Sugar-loaf.      I had lately an opportunity of ascending and                               it,

large portion of it bore evident marks of a late and violent
eruption.     The cold was extreme, and the ascent difficult; but,
owing to a mistake of the guides, the party did not reach the
M.,

 by De Geer that the tarsus of Coccinella, usually regarded as
 trimerous, is really tetramerous; for, speaking of the third or
 claw-joint, he says: “Cette partie qui a une articulation près
 de son origine,” &c.; and this accessary joint he has also
 figured". Mr. Spence, in a letter to me dated July 13, 1809,
 observes that Müller had discovered this joint in that genus;
and further remarks, “But on examining the Lepturae, Ceram
byces, and Chrysomela tenebricosa, I find (what had escaped
 Müller) that the claw-joint of these also has a similar minute
joint at the base; so that if this be allowed to be a true joint,
these have in truth five-jointed tarsi.”         Mr. Spence, however,
did not    regard  this as a true   joint,  or one having separate mo
tion.    Upon   receiving this intimation                        I
                                                 made a pretty general
examination of tetramerous beetles, and found that the Chry
somelae of Linné in general have this joint, as likewise Curcu
lio L., and others; I discovered also that it is a true joint,
moved by muscles of                   in its

XXXII.       On the Use of Analysis in investigating the Elementary

INsome

                                 pointed out a method by which
         objections    to Legendre's   mode of evolving the pro
 perties of figure from functional equations might be obviated;
and    Iresume the subject in the hope of clearing away certain
misrepresentations, by means of which a sect of our philoso
phers have sought to bring the principles of such methods
                                                  ãº
of inquiry into discredit. There is amongst one class of sci
entific men in this country a violent prejudice against the use
of analysis, either in the           of geometry or of mechanics.
They regard        not    it,             as
                           the mere substitution      one mode                          of                      of
reasoning for another, but          dangerous attempt as

built, and     revive the justly exploded philosophy

   The following three sentences        the concluding paragraphof
of his note respecting Legendre will amply serve my purpose.

that every philosophic mind will now-a-days concur. There

tion; or, to speak in plainer terms, he has to ascertain some fact
or property containing the complete definition of the rela
tions he has recognised: and the analyst has to search for cir
cumstances which may lead him to the determination of t. In
the former case, the definition must be obtained in the only
manner in which the character of the visible world can be
made known to intellect, viz. by eaperiment: and since p is
merely the symbolic representation of a figure, nothing de
finitive of it can be primarily obtained, excepting from that
figure, and consequently fiom experiment also. From the
circumstance that the equation determining p must be one
with six values, the analyst knows that at least three of the
quantities included in 4 must exist co-indeterminately—super
position informs him that only three can exist in such a state:
and this, in union with his experimental knowledge of the
abstract quantities a, b, c, A, B, C, is sufficient to guide him in
his varied transformations and final evaluation of p. Such
then are the two methods, agreeing most scrupulously in the
minutest circumstance affecting the principles on which they
rest, and differing * only in the different artifices by which
they particularize, transform, and combine the experimental
facts.                                         I

rated more forcibly than any prejudice should operate within
the cold and calm regions of science, this nice philosophical
agreement had never been overlooked, and the invidious and

of the laws of motion by Euler, D'Alembert, &c. They are
essentially unphilosophical and fallacious.      But I am not dis
posed either to extend the same agreement to the remark re
lative to the composition of forces, or to recognise the philoso
phical accuracy of the investigation which the learned Pro
fessor has himself given of          it. remarked somewhere by

with that of Laplace                         I
                        when think of capillary attraction. He
has many other   honours,  and I am happy to know that he will
soon have more.     Professor Leslie is too far above an anony
mous writer to be affected either by his praise or blame, but
for that very reason I deem his errors dangerous. Now-a-days
every great mind is bent on extending the boundaries of sci
ence. The questions and disputes of philosophy that sur
round         its

 wash the insoluble residuum till the liquid no longer acts on
 test paper. To separate from the washings the small portion
 of titanium which is dissolved with the silica, I slightly super
 saturate them, evaporate them to a humid saline consistence
in a porcelain vessel, moisten the saline product in water, and
receive it on a filtre, where the silica becomes deposited;

   4. The titanium not dissolving so easily in the potash as
the alumine every time they meet, the insoluble residuum pre
serves a gelatinous character; and in order to separate it from
the substances with which it is mixed, this residuum is dissolved
in hydrochloric acid, by which treatment some portions of                                       si
lica are also separated: the iron of this solution is precipitated
by the hydrocyanate of potash and of iron; the liquid is then
saturated with an alkaline subcarbonate, and it is carried to
ebullition.   The precipitate which becomes formed is white,
bulky, and has the aspect of alumina: as it may consist of
a mixture of titanium, magnesia, and lime, the first is ren
dered insoluble in acids by being strongly heated, and the
earths are dissolved by digestion for some hours in a weak
acid—say distilled vinegar. The insoluble parts are separated
by a filtre; the liquid is treated with ammonia, in order to re
move the magnesia, with oxalate of ammonia for the lime:
and we know that the operation has been well conducted, if it
does not afterwards undergo any change with the infusion of
galls. To the liquids which have been put aside is then also
added that from which the iron and other substances have
been separated.

commonly supposed), and by the aid of which the black fo–

       on the Preservation       of the Copper Sheathing of Ships.              205
   I  had anticipated the deposition of alkaline substance in cer
 tain cases upon the negatively electrical copper. This has
 actually happened. Some sheets of copper that have been
 exposed nearly four months to the action of sea-water, de
 fended by from ºth to ºth of their surface of zinc and iron,
 have become coated with a white matter, which on analysis has
 proved to be principally carbonated lime and carbonate and
 hydrate of magnesia. . The same thing has occurred with two
 harbour boats, one of which was defended by a band of zinc,
 the other by a band of iron,   -  equal to about ºth of the surface
                                                        -
 of the copper.                                                            -
    These sheets and boats remained perfectly clean for many
                                                                                j
 weeks, as long as the metallic surface of the copper was ex
 posed; but lately, since it has become coated with carbonate
 of lime and magnesia, weeds have adhered to these coatings,
 and insects collected on them : but on the sheets of copper,
 defended by quantities of cast iron and zinc, bearing a pro
portion below rinth, the electrical power of the copper bein
 less negative, more neutralized, and nearly in equilibrio
 that of the menstruum, no such effects of deposition of alkaline
 matter or adherence of weeds have taken place; and the surface,
though it has undergone a slight degree of solution, has                        re
mained perfectly clean; a circumstance of great importance,
as it points out the limits of protection, and makes the appli
cation of a very small quantity of the oxidable metal more ad
vantageous in fact than that of a larger one.                           -
    The wear of cast iron is not so          rapid   but that a mass of
two or three inches in thickness will last for some years; at
least the consumption in experiments which have been going
                           º
on for nearly four months does not indicate a higher ratio.
This must, however, depend on the relation of                     mass   its     to
that   of the  copper,   and  upon   other circumstances not yet as

   Alkaline solutions, for instance, impede or prevent the ac
tion of sea-water on copper, having in themselves the positive
electrical energy which renders the copper negative. Lime
water even, in this way renders null the power of action of
copper on sea-water".
   The tendency of electrical and chemical action being always
to produce an equilibrium in the electrical powers, the agency
of all combinations formed of metals and fluids is to occasion
decomposition, in such an order that alkaline, metallic, and
inflammable matters are determined to the negative part of
the combination; and chlorine, iodine, oxygen, and acid
matters to the positive part.   I have shown in the Bakerian
lecture for 1806, that this law holds good in the Voltaic bat
tery. The same law

SINCE  I            had the honour of communicating to the Astro
  nomical     Society a short account of an arithmetical engine
for the calculation of tables, which has been examined by se
veral of the members of this society, I have not added much
to the practical part of the subject. I have however paid some
attention to the improvements of which the machinery is sus
ceptible, and which will, if another engine is made, be greatly
improved.
       he theoretical inquiries to which it has conducted me are
however of a singular nature; and I shall take this opportu
 nity of briefly explaining to the society some of the principles
on which they depend, as far as the nature of the subject will
 permit me to do this without the introduction of too many
 algebraic operations, which are rarely intelligible when read
 to a large assembly.
    Of the variety of tables which are required in the present
state of science, by far the larger portion are intimately con
nected with that department of it which it is the peculiar ob
                         º

the proudest triumph of intellectual power, or considered as

 the most valuable present of abstract science to the comfort

                                          the Philosophical Magazine and
      Journal,         upon the Correspondence between Sir JAMEs Edward
      SMITH,           and Mr. LINDLEY, which has lately appeared                                     in
   that Journal.   By John LINDLEY, Esq. F.L.S. &c. Ridg

form, together with the correspondence already printed in the
 Philosophical Magazine, and accompanied by some animad
 versions on the soundness of our judgement in the performance
 of our editorial duty in the present case.
     The Editors of this Journal have more than once had oc
 casion to deprecate the uncourteous style and acrimonious
feeling too often, and most unnecessarily, introduced into sci
entific controversy; and in several instances they have, as in
the present case, judged it right to refuse to allow those pages
tobeoccupied with angry personalities, which should be devoted
to the advancement of knowledge. The present Editor is fully
 disposed to pursue the same course, as most agreeable to him
 self and most advantageous to the cause of science.
   . In the present instance the Editor must rest his justification
 entirely on the tone and temper of Mr. Lindley's letters: he
 is quite at a loss to find anything in the first letter of Sir
J. E. Smith that could call for the style which Mr. Lindley has
 unfortunately adopted, and against which, with the mostfriendly
feelings towards that gentleman, he thought it right to protest.
 The first letter of Sir J. E. Smith, instead of being intended as
an attack on Mr. Lindley, originated, as the Editor is fully
persuaded, in the kindness of the writer towards himself, and
 a wish to assist the Philosophical Magazine by an occasional
 contribution.
     Mr. Lindley alleges that he has only “imitated the contro
versial manner peculiar to Sir J. E. Smith’<U+017F> Here the Editor is
 completely at issue with him; and concludes by confidently
appealing to the entire difference of their “controversial man
ner” as his justification for declining to insert the reply, wholly
disavowing those partial or prudential motives which are sug
gested in this pamphlet.

of  the plastic, and probably also of the London clays; and
that these two basins were once connected together across the
now intermediate chalky strata of the downs of Hants, Wilts,
and Dorset; since it appears that the plastic clay formation is
so far from being limited to the lower levels of the present
basins, that large residuary fragments of it still occur on the
summits of the most elevated portions of chalk in these coun
ties, e.g. on the summit of Inkpen near Newbury, and on that
of Blackdown near Abbotsbury, as well as on the top of Chid
bury and Beacon hills in the highest part of Salisbury plain.
The strata that covered the intermediate spaces have probably
been removed by diluvial denudation, and the destructible na
ture of their component materials would render them pecu
liarly liable to be swept away by the transit of violent currents
of water. The wreck of the harder portions of the sand
strata thus destroyed       forms the sandstone blocks called Grey
Weathers that           lie

structed.      In  lower levels within the existing basins these
same strata have been less destroyed,                consequence in       the     of
greater protection their low position has afforded them from
the ravages      ofdiluvial denudation.

of this instrument is determined by a formula, in which the
sum of three arcs is taken from the semicircumference; one of
them resulting from the actual observation, the other two
from a cosine and a tangent, ascertainable by computation
from the theorem itself.    In an extensive use of this microme
ter, tables may easily be formed to facilitate the computation.

 From the trials made at                en, it would appear that
one-third more brandy is produced          by the usual processes.
In Professor Oersted's   report,   we find the following account
of the  process:–The     potatoes    are put into a close wooden
vessel, and exposed to the action of steam, which heats them
more than boiling water.     The potatoes can thus be reduced
to the state of the finest paste, with the greatest facility, it
being necessary only to stir them with an iron instrument
furnished with cross pieces.     Boiling water
                                            ...     then added         is              to

 muriate of ammonia, containing 100 grains of the salt.              The
 change of colour in a few minutes was very evident.             The so
 lution, when tested, contained corrosive sublimate. The boil
 ing was continued with four other portions of muriate of am
 monia, 100 grains each; when the calomel was entirely decom
 poséd, 40 grains of mercury remained. Sixty grains of white
 precipitate were obtained from the solutions by carbonate of
 soda.    There was no decomposition of the sal ammoniac.
 With common salt I obtained the same results, mercury re
 maining, and white precipitate being thrown down from the
 solutions, by liquid ammonia. Common salt is not so active
 in producing these changes; as ten portions of 100 grains each
 were used before the decomposition of 100 grains of calomel
 was complete.       Muriate of potass and the earthy muriates
 have, I have every reason to believe, the same power; but I
 did not push the experiments as in the case of soda and am
 monia.”                   -
    The action of chlorides upon calomel Mr. Hennell has par
 ticularly investigated in respect to common salt and muriate of
ammonia, those being the substances usually employed for the
purpose of washing calomel, under the idea of freeing it from
corrosive sublimate, an effect which they fulfil when employed
cold and in dilute solution only.            But when perfectly pure
calomel is boiled for a few minutes in a solution of muriate of
ammonia or of common salt, and a portion of the liquor                                         fil
                                                                     a in          §
                             dºi
tered off and tested, a portion of sublimate is always
it;  and    onboiling  for     long
                                  a  time, the whole               of
                                                           the calomel                             is
decomposed, and                        of sal ammoniac and corrosive
sublimate, and of common salt and corrosive sublimate, are
obtained,         an
                 equivalent portion              of
                                            metallic mercury- being                                at
the same time     separated.
    These facts are peculiarly important            relation in  the pre     to
paration    of calomel, inasmuch            the Pharmacopoeia directs
                                                 as

228                    Nature of White Precipitate.
    Having inferred from previous experiments that the “white
precipitate” was a compound of one proportional of peroxide
of mercury and one of inuriate of ammonia, Mr. Hennell ve
rified his opinion as follows. A solution of one proportional
of corrosive sublimate (=272) was mixed with a quantity of
solution of ammonia, containing two proportionals (17 × 2 =34)
of that aikali; a neutral mixture resulted, white precipitate was
formed, and one proportional of muriate of ammonia (am
monia 17--muriatic acid 37=54 of muriate of ammonia) was
found in solution.   In this case, the 2 proportionals of chlorine
in the sublimate (36 x2=72) were converted, at the expense
of 2 proportionals of water, into 2 of muriatic acid, which,
uniting with the ammonia, formed 2 of muriate of ammonia.
The 2 proportionals of the oxygen from the water (equivalent
to the 2 of hydrogen transferred to the chlorine) united to the
1 proportional of mercury in the sublimate, to form 1 of per
oxide of mercury, which fell in combination with 1 of muriate
of ammonia to constitute white precipitate; while the other pro
            --
portional of muriate remained as above stated in solution. The
equivalent number, therefore, of white precipitate, is 270,-  and
it consists of
       1   proportional of peroxide of mercury = 216                          8O
                           muriate of ammonia = 54                            20

     Having thus synthetically established    the  composition  of
white precipitate, the following analytical experiment was made
upon      270 grains were dissolved

   Several thin glass tubes (previously tried by metallic coat

                                having wires dipping into them,

similar to small Leyden vials.      The resinous coating, how
ever, distributed no charge over the interior of the glass tubes
when connected with the machine, which would have been the
case with conductors.
   Upon removing the copper coatings and wires, substituting
pointed wires bent at right angles, resting against the interior

them successively from an electrified conductor, placing a

       From the annual mean pressure at these places,                                          I infer    that

mark of the river Thames, and that Mr. Veall's is 200 feet
above the low-water mark of the river Witham, mine being 50
feet above the low-water mark of Portsmouth harbour.    This
inference is made upon the supposition that the mercury in
each of our barometers is of the same specific gravity, and
similarly affected in             contractions and expansions

 236              Results of our Meteorological Tables
 of   the external air       in the interior of London, the mean tem
 perature here last year, and the difference between the mean
 at 8 and half-past 8 o'clock A.M., the mean of Mr. Cary's
 thermometer, as given in the table at 8 A.M., appears to be
 about one degree too low: I should therefore like to know in
 what situation he placed his external thermometer, or whether
 he registered from the one attached to his barometer within
 doors.
   The annual average temperature of Mr. Veall's thermo
meter is about 23 degrees lower than mine at half-past 8 A.M.,
which is as it should be, considering the greater north lati
tude of Boston, and the localities of that place and Gosport in
respect to their contiguity to the sea, which has been found
by long experience to modify the chilly air in winter, and keep
down the excessive heat in summer.
   The difference between the mean temperature of the ex
ternal air here this year, by a good horizontal self-registering
day and night thermometer, and the mean at half-past 8
o'clock A.M. by a Fahrenheit's, is ##ths of a degree: the mean
temperature of the external air at Boston for 1824 may there
fore be taken at 49°3, that is 2°; less than the mean of this
place. And for the last eight years of Mr. Veall's registering,
the mean temperature of the air at Boston may be taken at
49%, that is one degree below the mean temperature of Lon
don for    a series of years.
               É.
     Lastly, it may he seen by the table that the annual amount
of rain caught at Gosport differs considerably from either that
caught in          or at Boston. Gosport being on the south
west side of Portsmouth harbour, at the extremity of the
southern coast of Hampshire, it therefore receives the full
force of the W. and S.W. winds from the Atlantic Ocean,
which, on an average of ten years' observations made here
three times every 24 hours, prevail nearly four months out of
the year, according to the following scale of the winds for that
purpose.

 It   further appears from this scale, that                  by
                                                 rejecting the
winds from the North and South       points, which are almost
        induration   each other, the winds from the West side
                        to
of our meridian have prevailed 19064 days, and only 10673

from the East side, which is as 2 to 1 nearly: this difference
is probably induced in some measure by a contiguous and ex
tensive sea, over which the air is free and unobstructed to
wards the land.
Causes   of the great           in the yearly Amount of Rain
                             Difference
         caught at different Places in the British Isles.
   For a proof of the facts, I will select five places in which
the annual mean depth of rain, for a series of years, has been
determined by punctual observations, viz.
          Gosport.                                           Malton.      Kendal.

    I observed before that we have                the       full force of the W. and
S.W. winds here; and it may be relied on that before the
rain that is brought up by the prevailing westerly winds ar
rives in London, it is not only diminished in quantity by pre
cipitation, but the passing nimbi, or rain-clouds, are altered in
their electrical state, by inosculating with the warmer land air:
this alteration, with the comparative dryness of the land over
the sea air, and the artificial heat of populous places over
which the rain-clouds pass, tend to absorb and hold in solu
tion a great portion of the passing vapours that would be
otherwise condensed and fall in rain in London or at Boston.
Upon this principle of reasoning, a less quantity of rain falls
at Boston than in London, which we see by the table is the
case; because the tract of land over which it is moved by the
prevailing westerly winds is of greater extent from the shores
of South Wales to Boston than it is from the southern shore
of England to London; consequently about one-fourth of the
rain is spent in       its
                         passage over the land before         arrives       it             at
these places.

242     Mr. Ivory           on the Theory             of the Figure of the Earth,
  . The result of Clairaut’s researches are thus concisely stated
in another passage of the same author:
    “Les conditions de l'équilibre d’une masse fluide sont donc.
  1°, que la direction de la pesanteur soit perpendiculaire à
  chaque point de la surface extérieure; 2°, que dans l’intérieur
 de la masse, les directions de la pesanteur de chaque mole
 cule, soient perpendiculaire à la surface des couches de den
 sité constante.      Comme on peut dans l’intérieur d’une masse
 homogéne, prendre telles couches que l’on veut, pour couches
 de densite constante;—la seconde des deux conditions précé
 dentes de l'équilibre est toujours satisfaite, et il suffit pour
 l'équilibre que la première soit remplie; c'est-à-dire que la
 resultante de toutes les forces qui animent chaque molecule
 de la surface extérieure, soit perpendiculaire a cette surface.”
 —Méc. Céleste, tom. 2*, liv. 3", p. 64.
     Confining our attention to the case of a homogeneous fluid,
 the conditions of equilibrium are extremely simple. The outer
 surface must be defined by an equation between three inde
 pendent co-ordinates; and the resultant of                 the forces actall
 ing  at  every point             of

tional to any two such lines. The lines         and f', in the               f                            di
rections of which the forces act, are likewise similarly situated
within the two bodies.      And as what has just been proved is
 true of the attractions of any two molecules similarly situated
in the two bodies, it follows that the resultants of all the at
tractive forces acting upon the two points will be to one an
other in the proportion of any homologous lines of the re
spective bodies, and that they will act in similar directions.
Again: since the velocity of rotation is the same in both bodies,
the centrifugal forces urging the particles placed in the two
assumed points, will be proportional to the respective distances
from the axes of revolution; that             and            is,

      Mr. Ivory   on the Theory    of the Figure of the Earth.      247
  rections: and this is precisely the new condition which, as we
 have proved, is necessary to the equilibrium of a homogeneous
 fluid.    It may be observed that, of the two conditions of equi
 librium, the one which relates to the attraction of the level
  strata upon particles within them, which is omitted in the re
  ceived theory of fluids, alone determines the figure of the
 homogeneous body: and when this is fulfilled, as it is in the
 figure supposed by Maclaurin, it only remains to compute the
 attraction, and to adjust the centrifugal force so that the re
 sultant of both shall be perpendicular to the surface.         What
 is said of the researches of Maclaurin is equally true of the
 discoveries of Clairaut, as far as they relate to the figure of the
 planets. In the first part of his work on the figure of the
 earth, that excellent geometer has proved that the equilibrium
 of a mass of fluid cannot be safely deduced from the perpen
 dicularity of gravity to the surface, which is the principle of
  Huyghens; nor from the balancing of the central columns,
 which is that of Newton; nor from the hypothesis of Bouguer,
 which requires the concurrence of both the principles just
 mentioned: and although, in place of these imperfect theories,
 he has substituted one drawn from more unexceptionable prin
 ciples, which is liable to no objection except when there is a
 mutual attraction between the particles; yet, as the figure of
 the planets depend upon the very case in which the theory is
 defective, the main difficulties of the question were left un
 touched.     In the second part of the work, which contains the
 author's discoveries relating to the figure of the earth, his       in
 vestigations are not deduced d priori from his theory of fluids,
but from the supposition of a figure either exactly, or very
nearly, an elliptical spheroid.
     If a homogeneous fluid composed of particles endowed with
attractive powers be at rest, it will be in equilibrio when it has
the figure of a sphere. Conceive that the spherical mass be
gins to revolve upon an axis with a velocity which impresses
upon the particles a centrifugal force very small in propor
tion to the attractive energy; the globe will now flatten in
some degree at the poles, and become protuberant at the
equator.      What is the exact form in which the fluid will thus
dispose itself?     Newton assumed, but without assigning any
reason, that it is an elliptical spheroid of revolution. The dis
covery of Maclaurin verified the supposition of Newton; and
as we are now in possession of      all  the conditions  of the equi
librium  of     homogeneous      fluid,       easy     prove
                                                 it to
             a                        it   is                that the
revolving mass cannot    be   in equilibrio unless    have the figure
which Newton supposed.

 XL.     Correction of an Inadvertence in a Geodetical Problem
    inserted in the Philosophical Magazine for July last. By

        Sir,
 INgazine
       the geodetical problem inserted in the Philosophical           Ma
                for July last, I find there is an inadvertency        with
 regard to the designations of the angles 4 and A, which are
 not the true latitudes, but angles having a very simple rela
 tion to the latitudes. But this circumstance affects neither the
 reasoning nor the accuracy of the formulae, which are strictly
 true when the proper values of the angles 9 and a are under
 stood.                                                                  -
     Conceive a semimeridian upon a diameter of the equator,
 and likewise a semicircle upon the same diameter; and from
 a point in the diameter produced draw tangents to both curves:
 then, the angle x is the inclination of the tangent of the circle
 to the polar axis; and the true latitude, for which I shall put
 l, is the inclination of the tangent of the ellipse to the same
 axis. The angle A is by some authors termed the reduced or
 corrected latitude; and my solution is true and correct if the
 reader will be pleased to observe that i<U+017F> and a stand for the
 reduced latitudes, and not the true latitudes.
     The property of the ellipse furnishes this equation,

  besides: each impetus thus causing a deal more ground to be
  passed over than in walking, where the progressive motion is
  at each step checked, and determined to the spot where the
 foot is set down.      But such a solution is not consistent with a
just idea of the nature of the action of walking. The velocity
 of progression of a man walking uniformly is not materially
 checked by any friction between his foot and the ground; nor
 is it momentarily stopped, as it were, and renewed at each step.
 It continues uniform, like the velocity of a boat uniformly
 rowed; i.e. is never much under or over a certain mean point.
 About the time of setting down the foot it is perhaps a trifle
 less than the mean rate; and just after the exertion of the mus
 cles of the hinder leg it is a trifle more: so that, for example,
 if a man walk at the rate of four miles an hour, his velocity is
 sometimes a little more and sometimes a little less than that;
 and so keeps passing at every step from the somewhat more to
 the somewhat less, without ever being suddenly checked or
j.
stopped, or ever differing much from that mean velocity of
four miles an hour, even for the smallest instant of time.
    The fatigue in walking does not arise from the quantity of
force necessary to propel the body (in quantity           include fre    I
           of application), but from other causes connected with
    e machinery of animal bodies, which                       I
                                                   will endeavour to
explain; first observing that the truth of this assertion will
be perceived indirectly, by considering that in walking down
hill it is so far from being necessary to use force to propell the
body, that, if the declivity be considerable, it is on the contrary
necessary to check the tendency to accelerated velocity: so
that if the necessary propelling force was the principal cause
of fatigue on level ground, we ought, comparatively speaking,
mile for mile, to be little exhausted in descending gentle plea
sant declivities, where the ground is good                the footing  .#

   rass on the sides of some mountains. The additional shock

in walking down-hill occasioned by the descent of the foot

                to                                   such ground  on
I   have mentioned. But         any one should maintain that, owing
                                     if
to         or other cause,               down declivities cannot be

 cipal cause of fatigue in walking is the exertion of the neces
 sary propelling force?        I presume, not.
    In order to explain the machinery of walking,
 let us imagine a body moving on a wheel of
 spokes (by which I mean one whose spokes are
 unconnected with each other, except at the
 centre of the wheel); and let us in the first in-_
'stance suppose this body standing at rest on
 two of           its
              spokes, and then              propelled forward to   be   some                                   by
 external force.            evident that while the forward spoke

four, or more steps involuntarily, as it may be called, at each
push; or if he forced himself so to move by not exerting his
propelling powers, except at every second, third, fourth, &c.

requires to be so much less elevated in order to determine the
action, as less carbonate of potash or of soda is taken. Thus,
for example, taking a portion of carbonate equal in bulk to
half the silicium, the inflammation takes place much below the
temperature of ignition.          With greater quantities of the car
bonate, the mass becomes distended by the production of the
carbonic oxide, takes fire, and burns with a blue flame.                     a               If
still  greater   quantity   of carbonate be      employed,     no   signs   of
combustion can be perceived; the mass does not grow black,             -
and merely gives out carbonic oxide.
    From this mode of action of silicium with carbonate of
potash arises a very paradoxical phaenomenon.                      some         If           in
combustible silicium is heated with saltpetre to a moderate
red, on a leaf of platinum or in a little crucible, no action will
be observed; but if there is added a little dry carbonate of
soda, so that it may touch the silicium, a detonation will take
place, at the expense of the carbonate, in the midst of the
saltpetre, and the mass will preserve for some time                    black          its
 colour.

the silicate may be separated by means of water, but the re
mainder can only be removed by fluoric acid. The quantity of
silicium obtained is extremely small; and this manner of ob
taining it merits attention only because it gives the same re
sult as the double salt when treated with potassium; which
proves that the evolution of hydrogen that takes place when
the mass is treated by water is owing to the potassium, and,
not to the combustible radical of fluoric acid. It is by the
process in question that Davy endeavoured to reduce silica;
and he obtained with the mixed silicate of potash only a brown
pulverulent matter, which dissolved in the water, giving it a
    eenish-gray colour.                 I
                                 observed the same colour in the so
 ution; but it disappears when this becomes clear.
    I passed silicated fluoric gas through a red-hot iron tube filled
with turnings of the same metal, and it was not sensibly ab
sorbed. The turnings when taken out were of a nut-brown co
lour, similar to that of silicium, and had the taste of fluate of
iron, in the places where the heat had had the most intensity.
This last having been dissolved by water, a perceptible pelli
cle of silicium was left on the surface of the iron, but so thin
that it was not possible to separate                We see  it.  this ex           by

position of the silicates by formulae, it would certainly be more
simple to consider silica as formed of an atom of silicium and
an atom of
                   .#. but it then would be difficult to conceive
the existence of the silicates which contain six times the oxy
gen of the base, as in the apophyllite,_in which an atom of
potash would then be combined with 12 atoms of silica.
   To conclude: It still remains to be decided to what class of
simple bodies silicium belongs. Since it has no lustre, nor
the property of conducting electricity in the state in which it
has hitherto been obtained, it is evident that it cannot be
classed among the metals, and that           properties bring  itsnear                         it

conducts electricity, but           not considered

highly esteemed, both for his personal qualities, his natural ta

   That I could have no such intention will be evident when
I state that in the first instance     sent him the substance of  I
the remarks which     you  have inserted in your Magazine, with
the exception of that relating to De Geer, requesting him to
put them into any form that might be agreeable to him, and
insert them himself; but as it appeared to him that this would
be committing himself with the Linnaean Society, he declined                                                        it.

   When the proportions of the gases are changed, so that the
explosive mixture exceeds in volume the olefiant gas, there is a
more decided action upon the latter, manifested by an increased
production of carbonic acid. Thus, for example, the explo
sive mixture being to the olefiant as 2% to 1, about one-fourth of
the olefiant gas was consumed; and by increasing the propor
tion of the explosive mixture the olefiant gas was still more
acted upon. On using oxygen sufficient to saturate both the
hydrogen and the olefiant gases, the ball acted much more
rapidly: in several instances it became red-hot;        the hydro             all
gen was consumed; and the whole             the olefiant gas was

272          Dr. Henry on the Analysis of Gaseous Mixtures
III.   Mirtures of Hydrogen and Carbonic Oride with Oxygen.
   The addition of one volume of carbonic oxide to two volumes
of an explosive mixture produces a distinct effect in suspending
the action of the platinum balls, and even of the spongy metal
itself. The action of the gases upon each other still, however,
goes on slowly, even when the carbonic oxide exceeds the ex
plosive mixture in volume; and after the lapse of a few days
the oxygen is found to have disappeared, and to have partly
formed water, and partly carbonic acid. I made numerous
experiments to ascertain whether the oxygen, under these cir
cumstances of slow combustion, is divided between the car
bonic oxide and the hydrogen in proportions corresponding to
the volumes of those two gases.       The combustible gases be
ing in equal volumes, and the oxygen sufficient to saturate
only one of them, it was found that the oxygen which had
united with the carbonic oxide was to that which had com
bined with the hydrogen as about 5 to 1 in volume.                       In
creasing the carbonic oxide, a still larger proportion of oxy
gen was expended in forming carbonic acid. On the con
trary, when the hydrogen was increased, a greater proportional
quantity of oxygen went to the formation of water.          But it
was remarkable, that when the hydrogen was made to exceed
the carbonic oxide four or five times, less oxygen in the whole
was consumed than before; the activity of the carbonic oxide
appearing to have been diminished, without a corresponding
increase in that of the hydrogen.
   In cases where the proportion of the carbonic oxide to the
explosive mixture was intentionally so limited that the platinum
ball was capable of immediately acting upon the latter, the
carbonic oxide was always in part changed into carbonic acid,
                               its                             by        of

by varying the proportion of hydrogen, that hydrogen and
carbonic oxide are most easily acted upon; then olefiant gas;
and carburetted hydrogen with the greatest difficulty. When
the action of the sponge was moderate, only the hydrogen and
carbonic oxide were consumed, or at most the olefiant gas was
but partially acted upon. Adding more                      SO as to
occasion a more rapid diminution, the olefiant gas also was
burned; but the carburetted hydrogen always escaped com
bustion, unless the hydrogen were in such proportion that the
ball or sponge became red-hot.
     From the facts which have been stated, it appears that when
the compound combustible gases, mixed with each other, with
hydrogen, and with oxygen, are exposed to the platinum balls
or sponge, the several gases are not acted upon with equal
facility; but that carbonic oxide is most disposed to unite with
  .#.        then olefiant gas; and lastly, carburetted hydrogen.
 By due regulation of the proportion of hydrogen, it is possible
 to change the whole of the carbonic oxide into carbonic acid
 without acting on the olefiant gas or carburetted hydrogen.
 With respect indeed to olefiant gas, this exclusion is attended
 with some difficulty, and it is generally more or less con
 verted into carbonic acid and water. But it is easy, when
 olefiant gas is absent, so to regulate the proportion of hydro
 gen, that the carbonic oxide may be entirely acidified, and the
 whole of the carburetted hydrogen be left unaltered. This
 will generally be found to have been accomplished, when the
 platinum ball has occasioned a diminution of the mixture, at
 about the same rate as atmospheric air is diminished by         ni
 trous gas when the former is admitted to the latter in a nar
 row tube.

     The effect of varying the proportion of free hydrogen to the
 compound combustible gases, on the degree of action which
 is excited by the platinum sponge, will perhaps admit of be
 ing explained, by examining the facts that have been stated,

out any light being evolved; that carbonic oxide is as inflam
mable as hydrogen; that olefiant gas is fired by iron and char
coal heated to redness; but that carburetted hydrogen, to bein
flamed, requires that the wire should be white-hot.        Now
this is precisely the order in which the three compound gases
require hydrogen to be added to them, in order to be rendered
susceptible of being acted upon by the platinum sponge;
carbonic oxide being acted upon with the smallest proportion
of hydrogen, olefiant gas requiring more hydrogen, and car
buretted hydrogen a still larger proportion. . It is extremely
probable then, that the temperature, produced by the union of
the hydrogen and oxygen forming part of any mixture, is the
circumstance which determines the combustible gases to unite,
or not, with oxygen, by means of the sponge. It was desirable,
however, to ascertain the exact temperature at which each of
those three gases unites with oxygen with the intervention of
the spongy platinum. For this purpose the gases, mixed with
oxygen enough to saturate them, were severally exposed in
small retorts containing a platinum sponge, and immersed in
a mercurial bath, to a temperature which was gradually raised
till the gases began to act on each other. In this way the fol
1owing #.      were determined.                    -
    1st. Carbonic oxide began to be converted into carbonic
acid at a temperature between 300° and 310° Fahrenheit. By
raising the temperature to 340°, and keeping it at that point
for 10 or 15 minutes, the whole of the gas was acidified, the
condensation of volume in the mixture being equivalent to the
oxygen which had disappeared.
    2dly. Olefiant gas, mixed with sufficient oxygen, and in
contact with the sponge, showed a commencement of decom-,
position at 480° Fahrenheit, and was slowly but entirely
changed into carbonic acid by a temperature not exceeding
                               §.
520°Fahrenheit. MM. Dulong and Thenard state the same
change to take place at 300°           = 572° Fahrenheit; but
having repeated the experiment several times, I find no reason
 to deviate from the temperature which I have assigned.
    3dly. Carburetted hydrogen, exposed under the same cir
 cumstances, was not in the É.     acted upon by a temperature
 of 555° Fahrenheit, the highest to which, by an Argand’s
lamp,  I   was able to raise the mercurial bath. This, however,
must have been near the temperature required for combination;
for on removing the retort from the mercurial bath, and ap
plying a spirit lamp, at such a distance as not to make the re
tort red-hot, a diminution of volume commenced, and conti
nued till  allthe carburetted hydrogen was silently converted
into - water and carbonic acid.

perature of 555°Fahrenheit; and on applying the flame of a
spirit lamp to the tube, it produced no action till the tube be

the mercurial vapour           the tube, formed calomel, which was
                                  in

high temperatures, then, the attraction of hydrogen for oxygen
appears to exceed that of carbonic oxide for oxygen: at lower
temperatures, especially when the gases are in contact with the
platinum sponge, the reverse takes place, and the affinity of
carbonic oxide for oxygen prevails.

   From the foregoing table it appears that carbonic oxide
produces the greatest effect, in the smallest proportion, to an
explosive mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, in preventing the
action of those gases on each other, when exposed to the
sponge at temperatures below the boiling point of mercury.
In general those gases which either do not unite with oxy
 en, or unite with it only at high temperatures, have little ef
É.   in restraining the efficiency of the sponge. There is an
apparent exception, however, in cyanogen, which it would re

when the
                       5.
                 are exploded with oxygen. . A regulated tem
perature also effects the analysis of such mixtures much more
correctly than the action of the sponge or balls, because in the
latter case the heat produced is uncertain; and though some
times adequate to the effect, yet there is always a risk that it
may exceed or fall short of that degree which is required for
the successful result of the analytic process.
   From the facts which have been stated, I derive a method of
obtaining carburetted hydrogen gas perfectly free from ole
fiant gas, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide, and mixed only with
a little oxygen, which, had it been necessary to my purpose,
might also have been separated.      The early product of the
distillation of pit-coal was washed with a watery solution of
chlorine, and afterwards with liquid potash, to remove a little
chlorine that arose into the gas from the solution. The re
siduary gas was next heated with one-fourth of         volume                   its                    of

9 volumes of oxygen,     I mixed 43 measures with 43 of oxygen
(=41    pure), and  passed  a platinum ball, which had been re
cently heated, into the mixture.     An immediate diminution of

formation of moisture. The residuary gas, cooled to the tem

these, 4.5 were absorbed by liquid potash, indicating 4-5 car

oxygen, gave 11 volumes of carbonic acid; the

stances which prove that 11 volumes of carburetted hydrogen
were consumed by this rapid combustion. But of the loss of
volume first observed (viz. 86-43’5–42-5), 2:25 are due to
the carbonic acid formed; and deducting this from 42.5 we

have 40-25, which are due to the oxygen and hydrogen, con
verted into water; and 40.25 x 3 = 26-8 shows the
in the original gas. But the sum of these numbers (26-8--
4.5+11) being less by 0-7 than the volume of gas submitted
to analysis, we may safely consider that fraction of a measure
to have been nitrogen. The composition then of the mixture
will stand in volumes as follows:
         Hydrogen . . . . . . . . . . 26'8            62-32
         Carbonic oxide . . . . . . . 4.5             10-50

    On calculating what should be the specific gravity of a
mixture of gases in the above proportions, it was found to be
303; which coincides as nearly as can be expected with the
actual specific gravity of the gas submitted to analysis, viz.
308. To place the correctness of the results beyond question,
I  mingled the gases in the above proportions, and acted on
the artificial mixture in the same manner as on the original
             I
gas; when had the satisfaction to find that the analytical pro
 cess again gave the true volumes with the most perfect cor
 rectness for the hydrogen and carbonic oxide, and within the
fraction of a measure for the carburetted hydrogen.       Notwith
 standing this successful result, which was twice obtained,      I
 should still prefer, for the reason which has been stated, hav
 ing recourse to a temperature carefully regulated, for the ana

  Philadelphia,   March 15, 1825.                           RoBERT HARE.
    Professor Silliman, about two years ago, published an ac
 count of some phaenomena observed during the ignition of
 pieces of charcoal by a galvanic deflagrator, the poles of which
 they had been severally employed to terminate. On the char
 coal attached to the positive pole a projection was observed
 to ensue—in the other, a corresponding concavity. The pro
jection he supposed to consist of carbon, fused, volatilized, and
 transferred from the charcoal of the opposite pole, where the
 concavity was discovered.                  -
    In a late number of the Journal of the Academy of Natural
 Sciences of Philadelphia, Mr. Lardner Vanuxem communi
 cates his observations on a supposed specimen of fused char
 coal, sent to Professor Cooper by Dr. Macneven of New York,
 which appears to have been iron—and the author appears to
 have received, and evidently intends to convey, the impression,
 that the substances considered as fused or volatilized carbon
 by Professor Silliman must have been similarly constituted.
    Mr. Vanuxem, speaking of the mass which he has exa
 mined, informs us, that—“It consisted of one large and one
 small globule, connected together by a thread, or thin bar, of
 the same material, and resembled a double-headed shot.”
    And again he says:–“ It was then put into an agate mor
lº
 tar, pressed and struck with considerable force—finding it
           without breaking, and observing that it received a po
  ish, it was examined and found to resemble iron. To con
 firm the analogy, it was next tried with a file, which acted
 upon it as it would on soft steel or iron—after this it was sub
jected to a magnet, to which it readily attached itself—and
 lastly, with a hammer: by           its
                                    great malleability, conjoined with
 the characters    justmentioned,      proved
                                           it      identity with iron.”
                                                     its
    He moreover       states,  that the substance      question was at
                                                           in
 tacked  by   nitric acid, and afterwards was chiefly taken           up
                                                                      by
 muriatic acid, whence           hydrated perczide
                                an                        iron was pre

 cipitated   by ammonia.
    On    reading    this account          of
                                         the substance examined
                                                                           by
 Mr. Vanuxem, was evident me that had not the slightest

as   fused carbon.          A product which      had myself obtained,

under my inspection.      Mr. Bowen assisted Professor Silliman
of at
    the time when he first made his observations on the fusion
   carbon. On perusing Mr. Vanuxem's memoir, Mr. Bowen
was       no
         less convinced than myself that there had been          mis                                    a

analysed             by
               Mr. Vanuxem was that which Dr. Macneven for
warded.      By oversight, one minute portion       matter may                       of                       be

     XLVI.         On Plans in Relief.                  By A Correspond ENT.
     To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine- and Journal.

       Sir,
SUSH  of your readers as have seen the plan                                   of the “Swiss
  Mountains” in relief, with a similar plan        the city of                of
“Edinburgh,” will readily admit their interest as a matter of
taste, and their political and geological value. The “Pyra
mids” with the sphynx and neighbouring country may be
seen  in the royal library at Paris; and I believe that a plan
of “Gibraltar” in relief has been executed with great minute
ness.   Evelyn, the author of the Sylva, mentions in an early
part of the Philosophical Transactions that he saw similar
 plans on the continent, and particularizes an island which
 gave him great satisfaction.
    The want of such plans has been felt in the original pro
jection of important drainages, roads, canals, rail-ways, and                                   all
 other works depending upon levels. Shading and sections are
 imperfect substitutes; and               an
                                    actual plan      relief, except in                        ofa
 mountainous country,         almost useless from the small propor

 true; when the lines          longitude are correct, the latitudinal

states the annual quantity falling here at 40 inches. As the
last three years have been excessively wet, the learned Doctor
may have probably imagined from the perusal of my reports for
those periods, that our average quantity for a longer consecu

 leave to request your insertion of the following, which are ex

account. Standing, for the greater part in a valley, and the
other on a gentle acclivity, and each bordering on the river
Derwent, which is bounded by the Yorkshire wolds from

east to south, and by the moors and the German Ocean from
west to north, with the numerous and thickly-wooded planta

about five miles distance to the south and south-west of the
town, the difference in the above annual amounts will not

                             the rivers and moist valleys.  The
reverse distribution sometimes takes place.”
  During the last eight, and several preceding years,

    To the Editor of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        Sir,
    HAVE long thought that one great impediment to the
    study of Solid Geometry consists in the defective state of
the present nomenclature adopted in that branch of the science.
This may be exemplified in the fact that several of the most sim
                                                                                                 .
ple figures have no names whatever allotted to them, and can
therefore only be expressed by a circumlocution; such for                                            in
stance is the figure of a brick, a box, or an apartment of a house,
which, as the nomenclature now stands, can only be described as

    These Tables for clearing the lunar distances from the ef
fects of parallax and refraction, are designed to facilitate the
computations necessary for ascertaining the longitude; and they
certainly appear to us to be better adapted to that object than
any of the various methods with which we are acquainted:
they are at once concise and simple; little is left to the know
ledge or discretion of the calculator; every thing is ready
performed to his hand; neither too much is given nor too
little;—and, what is of some importance, all contained within
a thin octavo volume, at the price of ten shillings,               so that
it will come within the reach of seamen in general. One
particular excellence, which is seldom to be met with in me
thods founded on the same principle, and which must be highly
approved by navigators,             is,

    April 5.-A valuable present of stuffed birds and fishes
was received from Capt. King, collected by him in his late ex
 pedition to explore the north-west coast of New Holland.
   The Committee appointed at the preceding meeting made
their report relative to Mr. Salisbury's paper on Trichomanes
elegans; and stated that the plant was represented to have
been gathered in Guiana, by M. Martin, and to have been
purchased by Mr. Rudge. It belongs to the genus Trichomanes
of Smith. M. Bory asserts that the spike described as the ma
ture fructification, is of a totally different structure from the
others, which are regarded as immature. It appears that Hooker
did not doubt the fidelity of Mr. Rudge's plant, though his
own figure supports M. Bory's opinion, inasmuch as the
fronds there delineated differ from those in Mr. Rudge's figure.
   M. Poiret has described, and M. Desveaux has both de
scribed and figured, the plant which corresponds with the
fructification supposed to be mature.-
                                              Weber and Mohr have
also the same species.
   In the Banksian and Mr. Brown's collection, were found
several specimens of each of the two plants, alleged by the
French author to be confounded, in             stages     all

In  every instance the Committee found the barren frond                                   of
Mr. Rudge's specimen combined with the fructification which
byhe
    calls the young state; and         constantly the frond, figured
                                           as

was  composed      of

fresh-water strata on the east side of the Isle of Wight. Those
which have been noticed as abounding in the limestone of the
lower fresh-water at Garnet Bay are chiefly referable to the
Chara Medicaginula of the French authors; in that locality
fossil stems accompany them whose structure is identical with
 that of some recent Charae, as for example C. hispida. . . . .”
   The author concludes by observing, that from the remark
able toughness of the integument of their seed-vessel, and
from the large proportion of carbonate of lime which they con
tain in a living state, most of the Charae are peculiarly adapted
for becoming fossil, and that they are accordingly preserved in
the recent marls in Scotland, both in a vegetable and a mine
ralized state, when the other aquatic plants which lived and
died in the lakes with them are entirely decomposed, or can
no longer be recognised.                - -

 eclipses of Jupiter's satellites are so recorded as to show the
 mean time at Bushey, mean time at Greenwich, and then the
 same as exhibited in the Nautical Almanac. The discrepances
 between the results of observation and the Nautical Almanac
are in some cases very considerable.        Even with regard to
the first satellite, the differences sometimes exceed a minute
and a half in time; and with regard to the other satellites, the
differences exceed 2, 3, 4, and in one case (July 15, 1818)
seven minutes of time.    In this case the discrepance is the same
with  respect  to the Connaissance des Tems.-The others the

 M        CH. DUPIN        finished on Saturday, March 26th, the
        * course of lectures on mechanics and geometry which he
 delivered at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers for the       in
 struction of the working classes. . More than 500 persons,
chiefly of these classes, attended his lectures; and no doubt can
 be entertained of their utility, for they were listened to with pro
 found attention. The progress of Industry will become incal

mines of Muzo, and Bogota: they have observed the horary
variations of the barometer on the coast, and at the height
of    8530 feet: they have analysed an aérolite weighing 1600
pounds, found on the             of the Andes: the pigment of Big
noina chica, which, similar to indigo, presents however a pe
culiar vegetable principle: the hot springs of Mariara, from
which very pure azotic gas is disengaged : the milk of the
cow-tree, which is nutritive, and contains fibrin and wax; the
poisonous and extremely irritating principle of the juice of
Stura crepitans; and finally the confusedly crystallized saline
substances which the Indians obtain from the alpine lake of
the Andes of Merida, called Laguna del Urao.                 Messrs.
Rivero and Boussingault found the Urao to be composed of
0.39 of carbonic acid, 0:41 of soda, and 0.19 of water: it is

306                          Earth of the Cave of Kühloch.
rous and herbivorous animals, which Mr. Buckland conceives
were not transported by water into the situation in which they
are now seen, but that the Kühloch cavern was the haunt of
 carnivorous animals which died there; and their fossil bones are
now found in a state of greater or less decay according to the
degree of exposure to the atmosphere that they have undergone.
       he letter A denotes a specimen of the soil taken at the
depth of two feet, B one at six feet below the surface.
     Both the specimens are, in great measure, in a pulverulent
 state, containing small masses which easily crumble to pieces;
 their colouris orange brown, pretty much like that of some bog
 iron ores (mines defer hydratées limoneuses). The colour resides
 principally in the finest particles, as is evident if we agitate the
 specimens in water, and decant the fluid before it has become
 clear; the pulverulent particles remain suspended, while a gra
 nular sandy matter subsides of a yellowish gray colour; when a
 depsosit has formed from the muddy water which had been
 decanted off, it is found to have a fine orange yellow colour.
 The specimen             A       contains a smaller proportion of pulverulent
 particles than B, and is also less coloured.
     Previous trials having shown that the matter soluble in water
 was in part alterable by the action of heat, like organic sub
  stances, I submitted both specimens to two series of experi
 ments, to determine first the nature of the substances indestruc
 tible by heat, and secondly that of the matter destructible by
 that agent.
     The results of the first series of experiments were as follows:
                        -                   Grammes.                         B.           Grammes.

  The loss must be rather greater in reality than is indicated
in the preceding tables, because the carbonates of lime and
magnesia must have lost a portion of their carbonic acid by cal
cination; but the effervescence produced during the solution of
the calcined matters in nitric acid (3) and (3), proves that the
whole of the carbonic acid had not been volatilized by the cal
cination.     I should add, that I looked in vain for fluoric acid
in the soil of the cavern of Kühloch.
    M. Chevreul then details the results of his experiments on
the nature of the matter alterable by heat; and draws the
subjoined conclusions from his entire examination.
    I. The organic matter of the soil of the cave of Kühloch,
destructible by fire, is formed of
    1st, A fatty acid, which in my examinations presented the
properties of stearic or margaric acid. 2dly,                  A
                                                      fatty matter
which was not acid. 3dly, An organic acid soluble in water.
 4thly, A yellow colouring principle, 5thly, A brown azotized
 matter.
    A portion of the yellow colouring principle and of the azo
 tized matter is certainly combined with alumina and peroxide
 of iron. It is probable that another portion of the organic mat
 ters is united with the subphosphates and the subcarbonates
 of lime and magnesia; it is also probable that in this latter
part, there is proportionally more azotized matter than in the
 former.
    There is more organic and pulverulent matter in the spe
 cimen taken from a depth of six feet, than in that from a depth
 of only two feet.
      II.There is in the soil some chloride of potassium and am
 moniaco-sulphate of potash.       Consequently the chloride of
 potassium and the sulphate of potash arising from the decom
 position of the ammoniaco-sulphate of potash by heat, which
  could not be collected in the process adopted in the analysis
  of the incinerated soil, must augment the loss occurring in the
  analysis.
      III.  The proportions of sulphate of lime indicated in
  the ashes of the soil, are not so great as those which really
  exist in    it;
               because, during the calcination,    portion
                                                         a     sul          of
phuric acid         is   decomposed.                                              -

                      DESCRIPTION                 OF MEXICAN COAL.
    The mineral treasures now laid open to the skill and enter
 prise of British adventurers in South America are daily
 exciting an increased interest throughout the kingdom: and
 as connected with the powerful machinery that will be em
 ployed in these undertakings, the subject of fuel becomes one
 of the greatest importance. The woods and forests, which
      .
 once clothed the sides of the Cordilleras in the vicinity of the
 principal mines, have been, for many years, gradually diminish
ing, and in many places have totally disappeared; while the
 Mexican proprietors, with singular negligence, have forgotten
 to        new plantations to supply that enormous quantity of
 fuel necessary  for the mines.                      -
    The existence of coal on the   mining   provinces  of Mexico has
                                                                                                                          of its
 hitherto been very doubtful.       Humboldt, indeed, mentions
 having been found       New Mexico; and that the formations

    Potash is not the only substance which produces this effect
with the metals and vegetable substances.                     Soda produces it;
so also does lime, and<U+017F> baryta,                 the latter not being so effec
tive as the former, or producing the phaenomena so generally.
The common metallic oxides, as those of manganese, copper,
tin, lead, &c., do not act in this manner.                                    -

     It has been an opinion hitherto received, that anhydrous
 sulphuric acid can be obtained in no other way than by de
 composing in a distillatory apparatus such sulphates as, when
 heated, give off their acid—such as calcinated iron-vitriol. It
 is generally known that the fuming                        vitriol from Nord

MM. Pelletier and  Huzard,  jun., containing  researches upon
leeches.
  “The authors of this memoir had been commissioned                                                               to

                                    the bad quality of the leeches em
  ployed in medicine. The two chief points which they pro
  posed to examine, are, 1st, To ascertain the causes which in
  certain cases render the little wounds made by these animals
  difficult to cure. 2dly, To examine the circumstances under
  which certain leeches do not penetrate the skin to which they
  are applied. On the first point authors agree with physicians
 in acknowledging that the inconveniences ascribed to leeches
 ought most frequently to be attributed either to the tempera
  ment of the patient, or to the nature of the malady, or to the
 means employed to detach them from the wound, or to the
 foreign substances employed for staunching the blood and
  closing the wound. With regard to the second point, MM.
   Huzard and Pelletier have found that there are offered for
 sale species of leeches that at first sight entirely resemble me
 dicinal leeches, but which differ from them completely; 1st,
  in their want of the serrated instrument proper to make the             in
  cisions in the skin, from which issues the blood that the ani
  mal sucks; 2dly, in the conformation of their stomach and               in
  testinal canal. The experiments of the authors have proved to
  them that the spurious leeches cannot be employed in medicine,
  because they do not bite.             M. Dutrochet has already de
  scribed, in 1817, the Annelide offered as a new species by MM.
  Huzard and Pelletier; but there crept into his work some er
 rors relating to the manners, the habits, and the organization
 of this animal, which for a year has been the particular ob
 ject of the authors.”—Rév. Ency. Feb. 1825.

LIII.    On the Binomial Theorem, and the Application of some Pro
    perties of A". 0" to General Differentiation and Integration.
    By John HERAPATH, Esq.
        the time I first became acquainted with the fluxional
FR9M
  discoveries of Newton, it forcibly struck me that his cal
culus was only a particular branch of a much more general
one.        I
         felt, therefore, surprised that mathematicians had suf
fered upwards of a century to pass without any attempt,                                                              I
might almost say without even a hint, towards              generaliza                           its
tion.  They    have given     methods        us
                                             which     can generally,by                    we

employing the same notation for the differential coefficients as
before, and ultimately putting t = 1. This expression, it is
evident, always terminates when v is a whole positive num
ber. It however depends on the properties of the differential
numeral coefficients whether the value of the formula be no
thing, finite, or infinite; but having considered these at some
length in the general differentiation it would be tedious to go
through a repetition in an application of them in this place.

   which   I  made during my residence there,                  I  wish to place on
   record an account of the opportunities which                        I   enjoyed of
   making such      observations,     with the       view   of   explaining      to the

using the ancient Sanscrita names, both as being more scien

a lapse of many ages, they continue to be known to                 Hindus             all

334   Dr. Hamilton on the Plants of various Parts of India,
Calcutta,       Ivisited the district of Chatigang, which, together
with that of Komila, formed the chief part of the ancient king
                              I
dom of Tripura; and afterwards skirted the hills of Komila,
where the tribe of Tripura still maintains a kind of indepen
dence. Here I had a full opportunity of examining the splendid
vegetation of the well watered districts of Further India (ea
tra Gangem), which bounds the extensive Gangetic plain on
the east, and extends south from what we call China to the
ocean. It must be observed, however, that this Further India,
as it has been called, is the proper China of the Hindus, from
whom we derived the word, while what we name the Chinese
empire, the Hindus call Maha China, or the Great China.
    The largest portion of this Further India, or Southern China,
is mountainous and well watered; but its mountains no where
rise to an alpine elevation, and, owing to a copious supply of
moisture, and a deep soil, are, in general, covered to the sum
mit with lofty forests.           Ihave already mentioned that a great
part of the proper kingdoms of Pegu and Ava differs a good
deal from the general appearance of the neighbouring countries,
the former resembling more the southern plains of Bengal, and
the latter the southern peninsula of India; but by far the greater
portion of this Further India, in              vegetable productions, re
                                              its
sembles Chatigang; and what Rumphius called India Aquosa,
or   the immense Eastern Archipelago, including the Andaman
and Nicobar islands, may                be

highest trees, again drop branches                the earth, which take

 root, and climb up the trees that are adjacent; and thus, with
other thicker, though less powerfully armed climbers, form                        a
 mat which becomes almost impenetrable. This thick vegeta
 tion produces          delightful coolness, and preserves
                         a                                       moisture

a luxuriance of vegetation that renders them almost equally
impervious with the forests; and grasses, mostly of the genus
Saccharum, shoot up with a prodigious luxuriance and thick
ness.     They generally exceed six feet in height, and often
                                                                        -

    The trees that are most common in this territory are of
the orders of Urtica, Euphorbiae, Terebinthaceae, Magnoliae,
Meliae, Guttiferae, Sapotae, Vitices, and Eleagni, and, to
 gether with the Palmae, Bambusae and climbers, form the
 great features of vegetation, which are of a totally exotic ap
 pearance to the European, having scarcely any thing to recall
 the memory of his native scenery; yet still highly pleasing,
 not only from their novelty, but also from their beauty and
 grandeur.      Notwithstanding this great difference of general
 appearance, several of the trees have an affinity with those of
 Europe, and the woods contain an AEsculus, and several Querci
 and Coniferi.
     The specimens which      I collected during this journey were
 transmitted to Sir Joseph Banks, in whose collection I saw
 them in the year 1806, and there they no doubt will still be
 found.                                                                -
     Soon after my return from Chatigang,          I was removed to
  Baruipur, a station near Calcutta, where         I chiefly employed
 my leisure in describing fishes.      Still, however,     I continued
 to collect whatever appeared rare for Dr. Roxburgh, especially
  during several journeys which I made through the great forests
  that occupy the islands formed by the estuaries of the Ganges.
  These dreary woods, half inundated by the tides, and skreened
  by banks of offensive mud, afford but little scope to the bo
  tanist. The variety of vegetables which they contain is by no
  means great; and the danger in attempting to collect them,
  by landing where tigers - are so numerous and ravenous, is very
  great.                                                                 .

    The cultivated parts of this Delta of the Ganges, as it has
 been called, are not more favourable to the botanist than the
 wastes. The plough or hoe occupies almost every spot, one
  rice-field succeeds another; and the houses are buried among
  groves of Mangifera, Artocarpus, and Bambusa, intermixed
  with Palma, and are only kept above water by being raised on

     After examining these countries of rigid vegetation, as it
  may be called, I passed through the gap in the Animaliya, or
  Elephant Mountains, and entered the province called Malabar
 by Europeans, but Kaerula and Malayala by the natives. These,
 indeed, consider Malabar as an English word, meaning the
 whole sea-coast between Cape Comoria and Surat, which seems
 to be the fact.     We ought, therefore, to call the province of
  Malabar    by  one or other of the native appellations.             The
 territory called Kaerula by the natives extends from the
 southern extremity of India to almost the latitude of 12# de
   rees north : but this includes a portion of the English pro
 vince of Canara; and it extends from the summits of the
 mountains to the sea.         In     vegetable productions and ap

many extensive regions besides Bengal, taking that even in the
most extended sense of the Mogul province of the name; for
in Hindu geography, Vanga, from whence Bengal is a cor
ruption, is applied to only the eastern portion of the Delta of
the Ganges, as Upavanga is to the centre of this territory, and

 mountains, which, the further west I proceeded, rose to a
greater elevation, were more rocky, and communicated to their
 vegetation more and more of the rigid and thorny nature of
that produced on the arid hills and mountains of Draveda,
 Kamata, and Chera.
    Soon after the rainy season of 1813 commenced, I embarked
at Chunar,   and proceeded up the Ganges and Yamuna (Jomanes
 Plinii) or Jumna to Agra; and thus had an opportunity of
examining the plants on the banks of these rivers, passin
along a portion of the ancient kingdom of Malava (Malwa) on
the east of the Yamuna river, near the Ken (Cainas Plinii) and
Chumbul rivers, and then proceeding through the centre of
the ancient kingdom of Kuru, which, in the earlier part of
the Hindu government, was the chief seat of power and glory,
                          §.
restored to it afterwards by the Muhammedan conquest, and
only lately restored to           by British valour and prudence;
for in the time of Alexander, Angga was no doubt the chief
seat of Hindu power, as Palibothra seems to have been seated
                        É.
opposite to Rajamahal, in Angga, although on the skirts of
 Magadha, which in latter times was the great seat of authority.
    Before the end of the rainy season I returned down the
rivers, and ascending the Gagra, entered the district of Go
rakhpur, forming a                    portion of Cosala, the ter
ritory of the powerful Family of the Sun, who reigned at
Oude (Ayudhiya). During the dry season 1813–14 I re
                                                  I
mained in the district of Gorakhpur, where made large ad
ditions to my botanical observations, both from the forests of
the country, and from the neighbouring parts of Nepal, from
whence I procured many plants.
   When the rainy season commenced I again embarked, and
                                                      I
proceeded up the Ganges to Futehgar, where had again an
opportunity of examining the vegetable productions of the
           º:
ancient kingdom of Kuru, through the centre of which the
Ganges passes; for it includes both banks of the Ganges and
Yamuna, being bounded on the east by Kosala, and on the
west by                 now called the Punjab, or the country
watered   by   the five rivers joining the Indus from the north
east.        -                                      2.
     Having thus examined a considerable portion of the
Gangetic plain, always considered the proper seat of the Hindu
race, descended from a colony of civilised persons calling
themselves sons of Brahma, who in the earliest ages settled at
Withora (Betoor Rennell), and gradually extended their power
over what is now called Hindustan,         I shall proceed to give

    This plain, extending in length about fourteen degrees of
longitude, in the middle latitude of 25°, and in breadth from
 two to four degrees of latitude, seems to derive a large pro
portion of          vegetation from the neighbouring hills; but
                       its

LV.   Outline of general Methods for the Development certain            if
       Branches of Analysis.    By A CoRRESPONDENT.

                the superiority of analytical methods of in
ALTHOUGH
   quiry is now generally recognised, and such methods al
 most universally adopted, it is still frequently to be observed,
 that the change which has thus been effected in many investi
 gations is more in the mere form than in the spirit.              The
 essential character of the algebraic analysis consists in the ex
 treme generality with which it regards every object it con
 templates.     It is this which raises it so infinitely above the                in
 vestigations of geometry. These are necessarily confined to
 the contemplation of particular cases, and proceed by methods
 which might almost be termed tentative.            Now the mere be-,
 stowing upon such methods the appearance of algebraic                            in
 vestigation, or the mere substitution of symbolic characters
 for words, does not constitute an analytical procedure. Before
 the subject can partake of the true spirit of analysis, tentative
 methods must be banished entirely—the reasoning as well as
 the result must be generalized—and                    all
                                                  the widely different
   rocesses    by which the    particular  truths             of

 subject in an entirely elementary manner; but it should be re
collected, that the arithmetic of sines, or any portion of geo
metry, when treated analytically, is not properly an elementary
subject.     It is decidedly transcendental, and the whole re

   The analysis of 4 and i<U+017F> might now be deemed complete;
but there are evident means of reducing the series to still sim
pler forms. The circumstances which regulate the invaria

between 4 and b, which, it is likely, will lead to important
consequences.

   These trigonometric functions being now reduced to ex
ponential expressions are of course given, and their various
properties may be deduced by mere analytical artifice.          It
were out of place for me to waste a moment's time in the de
duction of the simplest forms of their combination.        I shall
regard them in the course of the following investigations as
known, and hasten to develope general methods for the disco
very of the more distant and difficult formulae.    The sine and
cosine may be combined together into series of an infinite va
riety of forms; but the series whose terms involve either these
functions of the ascending multiples of the arc, or the ascend
ing powers of the functions of the simple arc, occur most fre
quently in practice, and are consequently of the highest                                  in
terest.   Let us then in the first place investigate the constitu
tion of series of the following forms
   A + B cos x + C cos 2x + D cos 3 x + Ecos 4 x + &c.
  A    + B sin x + C sin 2x + D sin 3 x + E sin 4 x + &c.
Happily the investigation does not present the slightest diffi
culty.   Each term of the two series is reducible to the form
                              2   v    4-    1    N   (2” +
                                                     (3)      zT")
and the summation of the series themselves is thus dependent
upon the summation of such a series as
                4 z   =   A     B'z + C'2 + D'2' 4 &c.
                                  +
  When the          coefficients A, B, C, D form either a recurring
progression, or are coefficients of any known transcendental
series, the infinite expressions may be summed at once.      A
variety of random expressions too may be found with equi
valent expressions in series.   4.2 has merely to represent a
function of z developeable according to rising integral powers;
and if either diminished or increased by 3 2T', a slight mo
dification of the arising coefficients will give their values
when the series correspond to given finite trigonometric quan
tities.  Thus the equivalence of 4 z to         and log (1 + x)   TF
gives us the seven series

of their latitude with greater certainty by means of a small and
portable transit-instrument, even if it were not more power

the compass plate, as will correspond with the course desired
to be steered.       For example: in the drawing, the compass
       is  represented    as set proper for steering a course due
north.
    The person who steers the vessel has only to keep it in such
a  position  that the shadow of the round                or of the inter
section of the cross wires O, may fall upon the surface q, so as
to coincide with the perpendicular mark thereon.                The line
A B or FG will      then  remain   in the plane   of the  true  meridian,
and the vessel will therefore proceed in a course due north.
In like manner any other course may be steered, by setting
the compass plate FG accordingly, and keeping the shadow

   This method of steering is particularly applicable to high
northern and southern latitudes, as the heavenly bodies remain
                                     j
constantly above the horizon, as long as navigation is practi
cable in those parts of the world, where the                      5.

unclouded and clear overhead; which circumstance is stated
in Capt. Lyon's late account of his unfortunate attempt to reach
 Repulse Bay, from which the following is an extract, viz.:
    “Although the fogs in the Polar regions are so frequently
mentioned in the course of recent narrations which have been
published, I believe they are generally understood as resem
bling our English fogs;                is not, in fact, the case.—In
the northern    seas, these   vapours rarely  rise to above a hundred
feet from the sea, and a sky of most provoking brilliancy is
frequently seen overhead.”—Capt. Lyon's Voyage of Discovery,

   An instrument on the construction above mentioned, for
steering without magnetic aid, was ordered by the Lords of
the Admiralty, and sent out with H. M. S. Hecla, on the Polar
expedition, in the year 1824.

366              Capt. Graydon's Celestial Compass,
left there to procure game, and the Fury stood towards the
margin of the ice. Just before we reached off the floe, the
weather continuing extremely thick, with hard rain,           I  desired
Mr. Crozier to set the extremes of the loom hanging over
Igloolik, which was then on our lee quarter. He did so :
but presently afterwards remarked that the compasses (both
Walker's azimuth, and Alexander's steering) indicated the
ship's head to be S.W. which was about the middle point on
which, but a few minutes before, he had set the loom of the
land two or three points abaft the beam.            Knowing, by the
true direction in which we were sailing, that the ship's course
by the compass, if unaffected by any foreign local attraction,
should have been about east, which in fact the needles had
indicated previous to the change remarked by Mr. Crozier,              I
tried what tapping with the hand (the usual expedient in cases
of mere sluggishness) would do, but without producing any
 effect.  Being now obliged to tack for the ice, we carefully
 watched the compasses in standing off, and having sailed about
 a quarter of a mile, observed them both return gradually to
their correct position.     Being thus satisfied that some extra
ordinary local attraction was influencing the needles, we again
tacked to repeat the experiment, and with a nearly similar re
 sult. The observations were then continued on one or two
successive tacks, the ship being steadily steered upon a given
point, by some object a-head; and an account of the whole is
subjoined in one connected view. The observations were made
between six and nine P.M. The wind being moderate at east

    “The deviation of our compasses was here very great and

otherwise: even Gilbert's excellent azimuth compass required
constant tapping,                under the influence of Professor
Barlow's plate, which had hitherto corrected it with the great

    “The stillness of this day was highly favourable for obtain

which we were fast was not of sufficient extent to admit of our

...thestream.  The surface of the ground and the bed of the
 creek are occupied by quartz and by sharp angular rocks of
 the greenstone family. The first glance is sufficient to con
 vince the spectator that the business of searching for gold is
 conducted under numerous disadvantages, without the least
 regard to system, and with very little aid from mechanical
 contrivances. The process is as follows.       During the dry
 season, when the greatest part of the level above described is
 left bare, and the creek shrinks to a small rivulet, the work
 man selects a spot at random, and commences digging a pit
 with a spade and mattock. At first he penetrates through
 three or four feet of dark-coloured mud, full of stones in
 angular fragments. At this depth he meets with that peculiar
 stratum of gravel and clay, which he recognises as the matrix
 of the gold.           If
                     the mud be very dense and tenacious, he ac
 counts it a   good   sign; and if stains or streaks of yellow oc
 casionally appear on the blue mud, it is a fortunate symptom.
 Sometimes he penetrates through a stratum of the ferruginous
 oxide of manganese, in a rotten friable state.            This he deno
 minates “cinders,” and regards it also as a favourable omen.
 Having arrived at the proper stratum, which is only a few
 inches thick, he removes it with a spade into the “cradle.”
 This is a semi-cylinder laid on                 its
                                          side, (like barrel bisected

of that metal in the ore.               I requested   a minute account of the
process.-The materials, namely,                    the ore, charcoal, borax,
}.&c. were put into a crucible—emetic tartar, in considerable
               was added to make the ore “spew out” the metal.
    pecacuanha was afterwarts tried with the same view, but was
  not found to be strong enough “to make the ore vomit.”
  After the account of the process, it was not difficult to account
  for the production of antimony, it being obviously derived
  from the emetic tartar.
     At Concord near the western limit of the gold country the
  metal is found in small grains in the streets and gullies, after
  every rain; and the gullies frequently disclose the stratum of
    ravel and mud, well known as the repository of the gold.
      ashings on a more limited scale are conducted here. The
  clay is not so dense at this place as at Reed's mine, but more
  ferruginous and full of spangles of golden-coloured mica.
  This stratum rests on gneiss, those before described were
   over the slate formation.

      Parker's mine is situated on a small stream four miles south
  of the river Yadkin. As in the instances already mentioned,
  excavations were numerous in the low grounds adjacent to the
  stream; but, at the time of my visit, the earth for washin
  (which was of a snuff colour) was transported from a plou
  field in the neighbourhood, that was elevated above fifty or
  sixty feet above the stream.        The earth at this place which
  contained the    gold  was of a   deeper  red than that at either of
  the other mines. The gold found here is chiefly in flakes and
  grains. Occasionally, however, pieces are met with which weigh
  IOOpennywts. and upwards; and very recently a mass has been
  discovered that weighed four pounds and eleven ounces. This
  is said to have been found at the depth of ten feet, which is a
  lower level than any I had heard of before. The idea of an
  aqueous deposit, which is apt to be impressed upon us when
  ever we either inspect the formation or reflect upon             origin,    its

      have already adverted to an impression entertained by the
 inhabitants of our gold country, that the precious metal exists
 somewhere in the vicinity in an ample bed or vein, from which
 the pieces found are derived. It may not be uninteresting to
 inquire whether we can obtain any light respecting        origin.                              its

and unyielding like quartz. The effect of running water and
dashing rocks would be to wear down the pieces of gold and
compress them, but not to break them.         The fine flakes and
dust of gold may be conceived to have been produced in this
manner; and the relative quantity of dust may afford some
means of judging of the original size of the lumps and grains
from which it was derived. In the gold of this formation, but
little dust, comparatively, is saved, although more, I believe,
might be saved by a more improved process of working.            At
present the greater part collected is in the state of grains, or
small scattered lumps. The inference        that this gold existed to is,
originally, that           is,

       between the author and a practitioner who is about ty

to    it,    founded upon the notes from which

                         as                                         observes,                  he
“it was my care collect the chemical facts professional
                               to                   all                                   of

     “9. But there is another point of view in which the same
 question may be advantageously regarded. The pathologist
 will have to contemplate the living powers in various states of
 languor and decay, when they will be found incapable of
 wholly resisting the laws which govern inanimate matter;
 and we shall learn, during the progress of the present work,
 that in certain conditions of the human body, several of the
 fluids will undergo the same chemical decompositions as
 would take place in the laboratory.          The same observation
 will apply to the agency of mechanical causes. In a state of
 perfect health, the fluids of the body will not descend to the
 inferior parts, agreeably to the law of gravitation, because
 the vital power opposes itself to this hydraulic phaenomenon,
 and with an energy in direct proportion, as it would seem, to
the robust and vigorous state of the individual; for if the per
 son be reduced by disease, this tendency will be only im
 perfectly resisted; the feet in consequence will swell. The
 following experiment of Richerand may be here related, to
show how greatly the power manifested in the living body of
 resisting, with more or less success, the influence of physical
 force, is enfeebled by disease.        He applied bags filled with
                                                                                         j

     May 13.—The reading of Mr. Henry Atkinson's elaborate
communication on the subject of Refraction was concluded.
In the course of this paper the author has collected and ar
ranged a great variety of meteorological observations, made in
different seasons, and at different parts of the world, for the
purpose of enabling him to ascertain the mean temperature at
the equator and in different latitudes, as well as the law of
variation in the temperature of the air at different heights
above the level of the sea. From these data he has deduced
formulae, by the use of which the computed and observed mean
temperatures in any given place, or at            given height, ap

city and density    at any given height. These inquiries are
guided    by observations and experiments that have been made
and   published    by men        of

fraction; and when the different portions belonging to the
different strata are put together in succession, they constitute
such an arrangement of quantities as proceed by a regular
   adation, or very nearly so; and nothing but a close exami
nation of the differences can detect that the whole succession
has not depended on one continued formula.       Besides the at
mospheric refractions adapted as corrections for celestial ob
servations, the author has applied one of his formulae success
fully to determine the terrestrial refraction       as it has reference
 to two objects standing in different elevations: so that whether
 this memoir be considered as a meteorological, geodetical, or
 astronomical communication, it cannot but be regarded as co
 pious, elaborate, and interesting.
    There was also laid before the meeting an account of ob
 servations made at Paramatta, in New South Wales, by Major
 Gen. Sir Thomas Brisbane, K.C.B. Governor, &c.; communi
 cated in a letter to Francis Baily, Esq. President of this So
 ciety.  These refer to the solar eclipse on January 1, 1824;
to several occultations of fixed stars by the Moon; to stars
 observed with the Moon near her parallel; to observations
 before and after the superior conjunction of Venus with the
 Sun, July and August 1824; to observations on the planet
 Uranus near the opposition in July 1824; and to observations
on two comets, one of which was not observed in Europe.
    Next there was read a report On the properties and powers
of an altitude and azimuth circle constructed by Edward

cannot be adequately described in an abstract.                 But some
estimate may be observed of            accuracy from stating, that by

the Panorograph of M. Puissant.—M. Arago exhibited to
the Academy an apparatus, showing in a new form the action
which magnetized and non-magnetized bodies mutually exert
on each other. In his first experiments, M. Arago proved
that a plate of copper, or of any other solid or liquid substance,

immediately affects the amplitude of                                its

   “On the 13th of August 1823, at a quarter past eleven in
the forenoon, as I was employed in measuring the zenith dis
tances of the pole-star to determine the latitude, a luminous
body passed over the field of the universal instrument teles
cope, the light of which was somewhat greater than that of
the pole-star.             Its
                     apparent motion was from below upwards;

396             Analysis of Tartarized Antimony.
 Natural History of Mexico.      The affairs of the mines wear a
very favourable appearance.
                    TARTARIZED ANTIMONY.
    We extract the following instructive analysis of tartarized
antimony, by Mr. R. Phillips, from the Annals of Philosophy.
    A. 100 grains of brilliant small crystals of tartarized anti
mony reduced to powder were heated during eight hours at
the temperature of 212°; they lost only 2-1 grains; but as    bi
tartrate of potash retains the water of crystallization when ex
posed to a much greater heat, I subjected 100 grains of tarta
rized antimony reduced to powder to a higher temperature.
Taking the mean of several experiments, I found that the salt
lost 7-38 per cent. by several hours' exposure to a sand heat.
When one portion, which had lost 7.4 per cent. in this way,
was heated by a spirit-lamp, so as to suffer a further diminu
tion of 0.4, it was decomposed, and becoming of a brown co
lour, it emitted the smell of decomposing tartaric acid.   I con
sider, therefore, 7.4 per cent, as the quantity of water.
    B. I attempted to ascertain the quantity of oxide of anti
mony in two clifferent modes. First, I decomposed a solution of
100 grains of the crystals by carbonate of soda, assisted with
heat; the mean of two experiments gave 41-35 per cent. ; but
the alkalies being imperfect precipitants of antimony, I treated
the solution afterwards with sulphuretted hydrogen, which
gave a mean of 2:8 of precipitate dried at a moderate tempe
rature, and which    I conceived to be hydrosulphuret of anti
mony composed of 1 atom of sulphuretted hydrogen 17 + 1
atom protoxide of antimony 52 = 69; if then 69 contain 52
of oxide 2:8 = 2*11, which, added to 41-35, gives 43°46 as
the quantity contained in 100 parts of the salt.
    C. After this, and in order to confirm the above statement,
I  treated two solutions, each of 100 grains, of tartarized anti
mony with sulphuretted hydrogen gas; the precipitates after
being dried on a sand heat gave a mean of 51.25 grains. Now,
if we admit, as above supposed, that this precipitate is hydro
sulphuret of antimony, and of which it possesses the appear
ance, tartarized antimony contains only 38-6 instead of 43.46
of protoxide of antimony as by Experiment B, for 69 : 52 ::
51-25 : 38-6. It may be further observed that the quantity of
precipitate obtained in C, as well as the inference as to the
quantity of oxide which it contains, agree very nearly with the
previous determinations of Thenard.
    These discordant results, repeatedly obtained, puzzled me
exceedingly, and I adopted two modes of determining the
quantity of oxide existing in the dried hydrosulphuret.

          I dissolved 45-6

                          grains of protoxide of antimony in a so
phuretted hydrogen: after washing and drying in the same
mode as before, the precipitate weighed 52.8 grains; and, as
it had the appearance of being an hydrosulphuret of antimony,
                                                             it by sul

I  suspected that it was subhydrosulphuret consisting of 1 atom
of sulphuretted hydrogen, and 2 atoms of oxide fantimony,
on which supposition I ought to have obtained 53.05 of preci
pitate instead of 52:8; and it will be observed that supposing
this to be the true constitution of this substance, the results of
B will agree with those of C as nearly as 43-46 to 44:04, for
subhydrosulphuret of antimony must consist of 52 x 2 + 17
 = 121, and 121 : 104 :: 51-25 : 44°04.                     -
    E. Further to examine this view of the subject,                   I
                                                              dissolved
100 grains of sulphuret of antimony and 100 grains of the pre
cipitate in question in separate and equal quantities of muriatic
acid, and decomposed the solutions with similar portions of
water; the precipitate from the sulphuret weighed 86.7 grains,
and that from the hydrosulphuret 87 grains; and as in i atom
of subhydrosulphuret, 17 of sulphuretted hydrogen, and 16 of
oxygen = 33, would supply the place of 2 atoms of sulphur
  = 32 in 2 atoms of sulphuret of antimony, it is evident that
equal weights of these compounds should yield nearly equal
 quantities of precipitate by solution in muriatic acid and the
affusion of water.
    F. The nature of this precipitate was then examined by heat
 ing 50 grains in a small flask by a spirit-lamp, and found to            I
 my surprise, that it was readily converted into black sulphuret
 of antimony, losing only 1.2 grain of water. It appears, there
fore, that instead of a subhydrosulphuret as I had suspected,
 the precipitate was sulphuret, containing a small quantity of
 hydrosulphuret, but yet sufficient to give so much colour as to
 conceal the nature of the sulphuret. The difficulty of the case
 was increased by the fact already alluded                to,

LXIV.      On the largest Mass of Meteoric Iron which has yet
  been    discovered in Europe.  By Dr. J. NoeggERATH, - and
  Dr.    G.  Bischof,  of Bonn.”
     R. NCEGGERATH, on his former travels in         the Eifel,
      had been informed from various     quarters, that in the
neighbourhood of Bitburg, and close to the mill of Albach,
there lay a mass of solid and perfectly malleable iron of se
veral thousand pounds weight; but that it was not known how
it came there. In the course of his travels, however, he never
passed this spot.   During the visit of Dr. Chladni at Bonn,
in the year 1817, this subject was again brought under consi
deration; and as it was thought deserving of further inquiry,
                                                                º

   “The mass of solid iron discovered near                  (and of
              I
which was informed by Professor Noeggerath,) is undoubtedly
of meteoric origin; for it appears from the American Minera
logical Journal, vol. i. No. 4, p. 219, that Colonel Gibbs (the
same officer who took some pieces with him,) found them to
contain nickel. According to his statement the mass was mal
leable, and weighed 2500 pounds. It was round, in consequence
of the peasants having struck pieces off. Some parts were
semi-hard, others gave fire with steel. The whole mass agreed
with those found in Louisiana with regard to compactness
and colour,        less oxidability than common iron,

the   spot,   several   pieces   were dug up, and identified beyond
the   possibility    of doubt. These pieces were forwarded by
Dr.   Noeggerath      to Bonn, and Dr. Bischof undertook to ana
lyse them. Specimens were also sent to the Royal Mining
Department at Berlin, to M. Karsten, of the same place; to
Professor Hausmann, in Göttingen; to Professor Von Leon
hard, at Heidelberg; to Dr. Chladni and M. Bergemann,
in Berlin. Though unable to present an analysis of the ori

tain a correct description and analysis of this substance after
being smelted as above mentioned.

                                        I.    Analysis              of the Iron.
   1. A fragment of the iron, being well cleansed from the
scoria, was treated with nitro-muriatic acid. The decomposi
tion took place very rapidly; and in a short time the greatest
part of the iron was dissolved, whilst a delicate gray powder
was separated from                       it.

 of Meteoric Iron    which has yet been discovered in Europe. 407
lourless, this seemed to indicate that the precipitate of iron
contained no manganese.       The following experiment, how
ever, was made, for greater certainty.
    8. A third quantity of the well-washed oxide of iron was
dissolved in muriatic acid, and after proper neutralization with
ammonia was precipitated by means of succinate of soda; but
the fluid decanted from the precipitate showed no manganese.
It is to be observed, that a part of the fluid evaporated to
dryness left an entirely white mass of salt, which was found to
be common salt with the excess of succinate of soda.      In this
residuum there was no trace of    nickel; which is the more re
markable, as several of our most distinguished analysts have
found that the oxide of nickel precipitated at the same time
 with oxide of iron by the ammonia, cannot be entirely ex
 tracted from the precipitating medium, although the latter be
 added in ever such abundance. In conformity to this, we
 might have expected to find oxide of nickel in the oxide of
 iron employed for the above experiment; but it was not the

                         Analysis of the Scoria.
   The scoria, reduced to a fine powder in the steel mortar, was
dissolved in hot nitro-muriatic acid, leaving an earthy powder,
which it could answer no purpose to examine. This solution
showed scarcely a trace of nickel; so that during the smelting
of the iron mass, the iron only, and not the nickel, had been
converted into scoria. A part of the sulphur, however, en
tered the scoria; for muriate of barytes produced a precipitate
in the solution. The oxide of iron precipitated by ammonia,
being well washed, was examined in the above manner for
chrome but not a trace of it was to be detected; which shows
that chrome had not passed over to the scoria during the
smelting, as might have been expected.
   The result, therefore, of these experiments            is,
                                                     that the iron
mass consisted      of
                    iron, nickel, and 3-04 per cent       sulphur; of

   3. As no sulphur has yet been found in the solid meteoric
masses of iron in the analyses hitherto made, the proportion
of 3-04 per cent in a mass which had been smelted is the
more striking, as it must be supposed that during the latter
process some parts were volatilized and others transferred to
the scoria. We must leave it undecided, whether this pro
portion of sulphur was combined equally with the whole mass
of metal, or appeared only as a constituent part of sulphuret
of iron, such as is found in meteoric stones, properly so called.
The latter supposition seems the most probable, and agrees
with Gibbs’s account of the different degrees of hardness in
this mass, but not with M. Müller's assertions with respect
to It its
       homogeneity.
      must however be observed, that sufficient attention was

duced from the furnace; the more so, since it was merely
 smelted, and not actually refined.
    6. In justification of the title of this memoir, we beg leave
to observe that the solid iron-mass found by Pallas weighed
 1400 pounds; that which fell in 1751, near                  only

that of 1814, at Lenarto, in Hungary, 194 pounds.
   It is true that the mass which is the subject of the present
observations,   although between 3300 and 3400 pounds, is
greatly surpassed by those found in various parts of America,
which are stated at 14,000, 30,000, and 40,000 pounds.

 burg. The two latter resemble the former in colour, and in
 containing nickel; they are in like manner tenacious, and found
 in isolated masses. That of Louisiana contains a trace of car
 bon; and to judge from the hardness of a part of the Bitburg
 mass, it must have contained some carbon also, like those of
  South America, and Magdeburg. Those of Mexico and Peru
 are found in volcanic districts like that of Bitburg, which lies in
 the region of the extinguished volcanoes of the Rhine *. The

 scoria, and were considered               by
                                        Professor Bischof and myself
 as  magnetic ironstone.        Professor Hausmann, however, no
 ticed that these crystals were exactly similar              those which to
  he described      his treatise

   The preceding account had already been sent to press, when
I received the last number (6° Ann, 2° Cah.) of Memoires du
Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, in which Laugier inserts the ana
lysis of a meteoric mass of iron similar to that of Pallas. It also
contained sulphur. Laugier examined two varieties of this me
teoric iron found in 1809 at Brahin, in the district of Rziezyca
Minsk. He says, that it perfectly resembles that of Siberia,
being in like manner full of cavities, which seem to be covered
with a vitreous greenish-yellow substance, which was easily
detached, and was considered to be olivine.

the same animal the heads and vertebrae, which                     at that
time never been found in connexion, and whose actual relation
was therefore regarded by many as equivocal, in indicating the
order and place of the several kinds of vertebrae, and in tracing
the osteology of the humero-sternal parts, my opinions have
received full confirmation.        In the attempted restoration of the
paddle also (though professedly given only on conjecture) a
very considerable approximation to the true structure of the

afforded by the fragments which had then been obtained.

shaped processes, and three anterior dorsal with false ribs be

dently be the end of this great multiplication of the joints, it
may perhaps excite surprise that the joints, instead of articu
lating as in birds by cylindrical surfaces, should have their
contiguous faces nearly flat, which must have allowed a less
freedom of motion between each vertebra; but it may be an
swered, that the increased number of the joints compensated
for the stiffness of each.

place, and are scattered over the mass of shale in which they
are imbedded.       In consequence of this accident, we are ad
mitted to a full view of the ribs and sterno-costal arcs and
pelvis, which remain undisturbed.          Fourteen large ribs may

cartilages: the nice adaptation of these parts is beautifully
displayed in the specimen.
    The pelvis is finely displayed, and resembles the usual type
of this part in reptiles, of which the turtle perhaps affords the
best example for comparison with the fossil: the ilium is re
duced to a long and slender bone, which might, if seen de
tached, be mistaken for the os pubis; that of several species of
turtle is exactly similar. The ischium is like that of most
reptiles; and the pubis, as is also common in this class, is so
greatly dilated as to be liable to be mistaken                   the ilium             for
if found separately.       All these parts are very nearly              situ,                     in

Mr. E. Turrell's               Menstruum        for Biting-in         on Steel Plates.       423
culty was experienced in biting-in the etched plates; for, what
ever acid was used, it invariably happened that the lines when
corroded were exceedingly shallow and rough upon the edges,
many times so much so as to cause serious disappointments
and great loss to those engaged.           Such, indeed, was the risk
of   failure,   that several artists have refused to execute any
thing on steel, on account of the difficulty of biting-in       •    their
etchings.
     Ibelieve I am correct when I state that Messrs. Perkins and
Heath paid the late Mr. Lowry fifty pounds for the secret of
a menstruum that would effect the biting on steel in a manner
superior to that which they had previously practised.                 It is
but justice to state, that, previous to purchasing the before
named secret, their method was stated to all who applied to
know      it,and this consisted     using the worn-out acid that had
                                               in
been used for biting-in copper plates, which, therefore, was                                  an

this the results were       very  unsatisfactory,    and almost always
the lines were         much shallower than those produced
                          so                                          cop               on

of this invention, as in that of almost every other, difficulties
repeatedly presented themselves, but these have been success
fully overcome; and the art, an outline of the gradual advance
                I
of which am about to subjoin, may at present be considered
as arrived at a state of full and vigorous maturity.
   In the year 1812, that distinguished ornament and benefac
tor of his country, the late Mr. James.Watt, suggested to me the
possibility of engraving in mezzotinto upon steel; but all the
attempts with which             I
                          immediately followed up the communi
cation were unsuccessful.     The hardness of the steel induced
me to    lay  that metal   wholly  aside; and some experiments
which I subsequently made upon plates of brass were attended
with no better results: these latter substances were so unequal
                               I
in their temper, that found them quite unfit for my purpose.
                                                                                      Ja
                                                        ñº.
   It was not, therefore, till the very recent date when Mr.
cob Perkins (whose indefatigable              and extraordinary
inventive  powers  are so well known and so   highly appreciated)
had produced blocks of steel soft enough to receive the im
pressions of our tools, and form a ground upon which we have
 been able to accomplish every thing required, that the art of
 engraving in mezzotinto upon steel can be said to have had                            its
commencement.
        In
       the month       January 1820, Mr. Say made
                          of                               engraving    an
 onone        of
            Mr. Perkins's blocks, and was decidedly the best

                                    Sir Thomas Lawrence.
    On the 30th       May 1822, Mr. Lupton received the gold
                          of
medal from your Society for his admirable performance,—the
Infant Samuel.        From the good fortune which has crowned
the latter experiments, steel plates have obtained            decided        a
preference over those         copper for engraving

              of

                           in          upon steel the tones are far
better defined than those obtainable upon copper.           From the
superior density          of
                       the former metal, the clearness     the lighter  of
tints    carried
         is           much greater perfection; and, from the same
                      to
cause, the darks have also        decided preference, being distin

guished         by
               their superior richness. The advantages            these          in

                                            deficiencies, which were
formerly irremediable           mezzotinto engraving, are now en

 artist was always contending, completely dissipated: although

the process is much longer and more tedious on steel than on
copper; yet, when completed, it is so perfectly satisfactory as
fully to reward the additional labour. The instruments used
in engraving in mezzotinto upon steel are precisely the same
as those employed in engraving upon copper.      When a deep
black is  required, twice the number of ways will be found de
sirable; from sixty to a hundred will not be too many. Steel
plates are now so well prepared, and are become so common,
that they are easily obtained by                       all

THE         Natural History of these islands has been studied with
  so much science                         and assiduity, and the investigation                    at
tended with so much success, that any addition to the num
ber of our species, more particularly in the higher classes of
the Vertebrated Animals, must be of rare occurrence, and
productive of considerable interest.    It is therefore with much

in  his British Zoology, under the name        Bimaculated Duck,     of
and introduced       an inhabitant of the British Islands
                          as                                   the                            in

has subsequently been included among the Birds of Great
Britain by writers on British Ornithology; but no further ac
count has reached us of the specimen alluded to by that dis
tinguished naturalist, nor has it been ascertained whether it
was preserved after it was communicated to him. The speci
mens of both male and female, from which I have taken the
above description, were sent up from a decoy near Maldon in
Essex, to Leadenhall-market, in the winter of 1812-13. Here
they were observed by a respectable naturalist”, who imme
diately purchased them and set them up.               From his collection
they have subsequently passed into mine. There can be little
doubt of the two birds being sexes of the same species. They
agree in           all
                 the essential particulars that serve          identify the              to

440   Mr. B. Powell's           experimental              Inquiry into the Nature
in the inverse ratio of their diameters, would diminish the
ratio of their risings. That this diminution was very trifling,
and not at all sufficient to account for the observed difference
.#
of ratio will be evident, because the 1st set was made without
              the box, the thermometers being suspended at a
distance from any object which could radiate heat to them;
and in this set the difference of ratio is quite as conspicuous.
This remark applies likewise to the possible communication
of heat by the air.
   (10.) We must also take into consideration the effect due
to the glass screen. When we consider the two bulbs as
heated only by that part of the radiation which is transmitted
through the screen, the screen may be regarded simply as a
third body placed near the two bulbs; and whether it pos
sesses a higher or a lower temperature, there will be a ten
dency to bring        all
                      three          equality

                                        their surfaces.    This effect
arises from simple radiant heat; whilst that derived from the
luminous hot body,        evidently following

     (15.) In these experiments it will be evident upon inspection
that the ratio of the effects produced on the white and black
bulbs is in every instance considerably greater, when they
were affected only by that part of the total heating influence
which is transmitted through a transparent screen, than when
they were exposed to the whole. This then would indicate,
that on the removal of the screen some new heating power was
brought into action, which affected the ratio by the addition
to each of             its
                    terms,       quantities
                                       of             ratio expressed

subject are certainly gratuitous assumptions.                We have no
right whatever to identify those two agents, or to suppose that,
because a heating effect very closely accompanies the course of
the rays of light, the light is therefore converted into heat: but
the theories above alluded to seem to regard the whole heating
effect of a luminous body as of this latter character.              In this
particular, the present inquiry has led us to an essential dis
tinction; and if the experiments are to be relied upon, this
peculiar sort of heat constitutes only a part of the total effect.

    It is probable that if other anatomists have sought for this
representation of the entire body in the head alone, they may
have imagined other relations, and it is by no means my inten
tion to follow them in this branch of their researches.
                                                                      .
    The circle in which I confine myself is already vast enough
to admit of our taking widely different routes, according to
the point from which we may each set out. This desire of
finding a representation of the body has constrained some
authors to assign to a particular bone, in Reptiles or in Fishes,
a denomination which they probably would not otherwise have

labours, to avoid that description of error which is so often
engendered by a preconceived theoretical opinion. I pretend
not to discover a constant and unvarying number of component
parts, nor the representations of parts remote from the head:
I  do not even pretend that the bones of the head must always
be absolutely the same in each genus;–but I strive to ascertain
the point to which their correspondence reaches, and the
limits by which it is bounded.      For this purpose I commence
with the individual animal of the oviparous class, which (at
least as regards the head) presents the most sensible relations
to the mammifera, or to some individuals of that class:—this
is the Crocodile.      I describe what bones it possesses which
are analogous to ours: and to establish the conclusion, I con
sult not only their position, but also the muscles which are at
tached to the part, and the nerves which pass through        &c.                                                      it,

   It is in each genus, after having thus studied and brought

living reptiles, that pass to the examination of the fossil bones
most analogous; and in this part of my labour I am equally
led into considerations of a much more extended nature than
had been suggested by investigating the osseous structures of
the Mammifera.
  The Mammalia, as they are the last, so they

                                                are the most
perfect products of creative power.
   The existence of Reptiles commenced much earlier: the
vestiges of these latter are imbedded in formations of a more
ancient  date, and the naturalist is obliged to follow their                                 re
mains  through   strata of greater depth.
   It has been seen, in my preceding volumes, that beyond
comparison the greatest number of viviparous quadrupeds have
left vestiges of their bones in the last alluvial beds or in ca
verns, or lastly in breaks or openings of rocks, that the sea,
which has flowed over them, has scarcely had time sufficient
allowed it to deposit the traces of      influx;       its
                                                      least, that

beds.  Some local formations only, and which appear                                     to      be
of   amore ancient date, include principally unknown genera,

Company.        By W. S. MacLeay, Esq. M.A. F.L.S. &c. &c.
    This  work,  which is intended to contain systematic descrip
tions of all the Insects collected by Dr. Horsfield in Java, is
 to be published in numbers. The species are to be arranged,
as nearly as possible, according to their natural affinities; and
in order to make this, the important part of the science, more
 clear, the descriptions are to be interspersed with such leading
observations on the economy and anatomical structure of the
families, as may render the work interesting to naturalists in
general, as well as to the entomologist.
    The second number is now in progress for publication, and
will contain the whole of the Coleoptera having Iuliform larvae.
 º
    The Insects described are arranged in the Museum of the
 Honourable East India Company, where it is stated they may
be inspected under the regulations established at their library.
    We shall have to recur to this valuable and interesting work
                               —
 in a future number, as it contains much that is of great im
            to those who take an interest in general views of
   atural Arrangement.

by the Rev. Richard Hennah.
    In  this communication the author describes an extensive
hollow or cave in the limestone rocks near Plymouth, in which
no remarkable bones have yet been discovered, but in which
stalactites are particularly abundant. Mr. Hennah offers some
remarks on the various causes and circumstances which have
contributed to give to these stalactites their different shapes
and compositions.

sandstone in the county of Forfar;” by Charles Lyell, Esq.
 Sec. G.S. was read in part.
    May 20.—The above paper was concluded.
    In the former part of this paper, the rocks which are ex
posed on the left bank of the Carity, a small river in Forfar
shire which descends from the mica-schist district of the
 Grampians into Strathmore, are described. The first of these
is a clay-stone porphyry; next to it is a conglomerate contain
                                   <U+017F>º
ing quartz pebbles; and then strata of fine-grained micaceous
sandstone and shale dipping to the south, and which are sud
denly cut off at an angle by the serpentine.         These strata of
sandstone and shale form part of a great series which overlies
the clay-slate, to which it                 succeeds; and is older
than the great conglomerate of the old red sandstone, which
lies immediately upon          The serpentine

under which the remains of quadrupeds were very generally
found imbedded in the shell marle in Scotland, often at con
siderable depths, and far from the borders of those lakes in
 which the marle is accumulated.
    These animals must have been drowned when the lakes
were of a certain depth. Their bones are found in the marle,
unaccompanied by sand or gravel or any proofs of disturbing
forces.    From the shape of the surrounding land in some       in
 stances, it appears that floods could not have swept them in;
and from the occasional absence of rivers flowing into others,
they could not have been washed in by them.
      he author therefore suggests that they were lost in attempt—
ing to cross the ice in winter, the water never freezing suffi
 ciently hard above the springs to bear their weight, and springs
abounding always in those lakes in Forfarshire and Perthshire
                                       -
in which marle is deposited.
    The skeletons of some of the animals found in the shell
marle in Forfarshire are in a vertical position, but some are
not. The same circumstance has been remarked with regard
to the elks occurring in the marle in the Isle of Man. Of these
facts Mr. Lyell offers the following explanation.
    Cattle which are lost in bogs and marshes sink in and die
in an erect posture, and are often found with their heads only
appearing above the surface of the ground.       When therefore
a lake in which marle is deposited is shallow, the quadrupeds
which fall through the ice sink into the marle in the same
manner, and perish in an upright posture, but when the lake
is deep and the animals are dead before they reach the bottom,
they become enveloped in the marle in any position rather
than the vertical.

Buckland, is related in a paper on the Habits of Animals, by
Mr. Broderip, in the 200logical Journal, No. V.
  Having occasion to suspect that hedgehogs, occasionally
at least, preyed on snakes, the Professor procured a common
snake (Coluber matria) and also a hedgehog which had lived
in an undomesticated state some time in the Botanic garden
at Oxford, where it was not likely to have seen snakes, and
put the animals into a box together. The hedgehog was rolled
up at their first meeting: but the snake was in continual mo–
tion, creeping round the box as if in order to make              escape.                      its

did not dart from the hedgehog, but kept creeping gently
round the box; the hedgehog remained rolled up, and did not

hog   on the body       the snake, with that part

tion of the curved images of the spokes; but if a certain rela
tion be preserved between the angles subtended at the eye by
the whole intervals of the bars, and of the extremities of the
spokes, this multiplication of images may be corrected. The
distance of the wheel from the bars is of no consequence, unless
the latter are very near the eye, as in that case the apertures
between them may allow too large a portion of the wheel to be
Seen at Once.                                                                         -

               bars, instead of being vertical, are inclined to the
horizon, the same general appearances result, but with this
difference, that the spokes occupying positions parallel to the
bars are those which have no apparent curvature; while the
curvatures of the other spokes bear the same relations to those
straight spokes, and to each other, that they did in the former
case.    When the inclination of the bars is considerable, how
ever, the images become more crowded, and the distinctness of
the appearance is thereby diminished. The deception totally
ceases when the wheel is viewed through bars that are parallel
to the line of its motion.

bination should take place of a progressive with a rotatory mo
