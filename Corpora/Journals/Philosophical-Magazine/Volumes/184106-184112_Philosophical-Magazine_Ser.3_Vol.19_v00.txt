   The first idea which occurred to me was that which seems
generally to have prevailed upon similar occasions, viz. that
this gas was generated from some change which had taken
place in the water after it had been bottled, from the decom
position of some animal or vegetable substance; but a little
consideration showed that this explanation was quite inadmis
sible, inasmuch as the sediment from the whole bottle did not
exceed half a grain, the water being perfectly bright, and the
salts upon evaporation snow-white; and the water became per
fectly sweet a very short time after it had been exposed to the
all".
    Indeed the common prejudice regarding the unlimited quan
tity of sulphuretted hydrogen generated by putrescence is per
fectly untenable, and is founded solely upon      disagreeable                    its
odour.    The fact           is,
                        that the quantity   sulphur     animal         of                by
matter     very
            is  small, and the nauseous smell           means                     is     no in
 an     infallible criterion       of
                               the existence      the gas.        of

 that river, by Her Majesty's sloop Wolverine, on the 11th of

    This water contained no sulphuretted hydrogen, and the

 lon, and consisted of the chlorides of sodium, and magnesium,

 strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen. It was tolerably clear,
 but contained a little gelatinous matter which resembled spawn
 of fish. The sediment of the whole bottle, however, when
 dried, only weighed fifteen hundredths of a grain.

                   in   the Waters   of the   Ocean.               7
  It  is difficult to conceive how such a striking and important
fact as the impregnation of the waters of the Ocean, upon such
a long line of coast, with this deleterious gas, should so long
have escaped observation.
   Upon searching for evidence of a similar phaenomenon
having been observed before, I have found in the Phil. Trans.
for 1819, a memoir by the late Dr. Marcet, “On the Specific
Gravity and Temperature of Sea Waters in different parts of
the Ocean, and in particular Seas, with some account of their
saline contents.”       Out of sixteen specimens which he exa
mined he found one which was brought by Capt. Basil Hall
from the Yellow Sea in the Chinese Ocean, which, from the
account which he has given, must probably have been as
highly charged with sulphuretted hydrogen as those from the
coast of Africa; and he observes, “there is something in the
development of sulphur in sea water which is by no means
well understood.”
   He also noticed that a specimen obtained by Mr. Schmidt
meyer, going to South America, from lat. 10° 50' N., long.
24° 26' W., had an hepatic smell, and had blackened the bot
tle in which it was contained.
   Since the report, which I had the honour to make to the
Admiralty, Sir William Burnett has been kind enough to
furnish me with the analysis, by Mr. Garden, of some bottles
of water, collected by Dr. McWilliam, of Her Majesty's ship
Scout, in March 1839, in the river Bonny, of which the fol
lowing are the particulars:—
   1. Water from the river Bonny, taken half a mile inside
the mouth, on the 12th of March, 1839, just before the com
mencement of the rainy season.
   Each imperial pint of this water contained 245 grains of
saline matter, consisting of the following ingredients:–
               Sulphate of Magnesia

and sent her to the coast of Africa.                  Not many months
after she returned to this country with the copper in the same
state as that of the Bonetta. The merchants said—the copper
smelters were inexperienced hands—they did not know their
business—the sheathing was improperly made; and they
brought an action against the Company, who defended                                                    it.
    Upon the trial some                   of

gen; for as you will see by reference to the experiments upon
the table, copper is much more acted upon by this substance
than iron, the latter being protected by the former; and the
fact     is,
        that   piece   a             of
                         iron attached     copper increases the   to
corrosion of the latter.
   Zinc,          on
             the contrary, protects the copper not only from
the action          of

    Now have long been
             I                       opinion that the experiment
                                                of                                                         of
 voltaic protection       the Navy was much too lightly abandoned
                                 in
 upon the first appearance                      of   an
                                         unforeseen difficulty, and that
 under circumstances otherwise the most encouraging.
    This abandonment, you are aware, arose from what might
 be  called over-protection,                     by
                                      which the attachment            weeds                      of
and zoophytes          the ships' bottoms was found
                            to                                       encou                 to   be
raged. Earthy deposits were formed, and                   these the weeds     to
and shell-fish attached themselves.
    The remedy for this appears              me         obvious: instead
                                                            to        to     be

 temperature of which varied from about 70° to 110°, and the
 water was filled up from time to time, as it evaporated, and
 the mixture well stirred.
    Upon examining them on the 5th of February, 1841 (three
months), the following was found to be the state of the jars:—
    No. 1 had a very disagreeable odour, but produced no
change whatever upon paper soaked in acetate of lead.
    No. 2 was perfectly sweet, and possessed, indeed, a rather
agreeable odour.     It produced no effect, of course, upon the
test  paper.
    No. 3 had a most insupportable sickening odour, much
worse than that of pure sulphuretted hydrogen, and instantly
blackened paper soaked in acetate of lead, throwing down
sulphuret of lead with a metallic lustre.
    You will have an opportunity of observing, by the speci
men upon the table, that the evolution of the gas is at this
moment proceeding with increased energy.
    Now, the analysis of sea waters generally, and these analyses
in particular, show that a large proportion of sulphates is   al
ways present in them, and there is no doubt that extensive
mud-banks must be formed at the mouths of the African
rivers, within the tropics, consisting chiefly of vegetable de
tritus, in the exact state which is most favourable to this
action.
    Since my report to the Admiralty upon this subject,   I have
seen a   paper  in the Annales de Chimie for     July  1840,   by
Dr. Amédée     Fontan,  upon  the Mineral Waters of    Germany,
Belgium, Switzerland, and Savoy, in which he suggests that
the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen in those waters may
be owing to the decomposition of the sulphates which they
contain by vegetable matters, remarking that many of them
which contain little of that gas at their sources, acquire more
of it by their flow through the soil. There can be little
doubt of the correctness of this opinion.
    A curious fact has also been brought to my recollection by
my friend Mr. Fownes, with regard to a spontaneous change
which a solution of litmus undergoes when excluded from the
air. It becomes of a brown colour, but still it is not spoiled,
for the colour is restored by exposure to air.
    M. Vogel (Ed. Journ. 31, 157), who inquired into this curi
ous fact, found that the solution always contains sulphate of
potassa, which becomes gradually decomposed with the gene
ration of sulphuretted hydrogen, to the deoxidating power
of which the effect is owing. A few drops of sulphuretted
hydrogen solution produces the same effect in a few days; the
solution becomes brown, but speedily recovers    its colour upon

                          in the Waters of the Ocean.                                                         13
contact with air. This case is the more interesting, inas
much as the gas never exists in sufficient proportion to be
discoverable by the usual tests; nevertheless it acts in these
minute quantities with great energy.
   But now a much more important and interesting question
than that of the preservation of the copper sheathing of ships
forces itself upon our attention, and that            whether the ex         is,
istence    ofthis deleterious gas       the atmosphere, which must
                                                       in
necessarily accompany           solutionits  the waters, may not

Coast Castle; three died before entering the river, and the
great mortality took place before they reached Damuggoo                                         at
the extreme upper end                       of

which they had long suffered, was, that the bags containing
the cocoa had rotted, and the cocoa had fallen into the salt
bilge-water and there become putrid.” Here, then, were the
very ingredients for generating sulphuretted hydrogen                                      to   a
great extent; the lamentable consequence has been before

subject, more and more convince me that the worst cases of
malaria are generally connected with the presence of sulphu
retted hydrogen.
    There is a paper in the twenty-ninth volume of the Annales
de Chimie, p. 225, by Signor Gaetano Giorgini, which offers
the strongest possible confirmation of my opinion.
    “The observation of Signor Giorgini has been drawn to
the state of the atmosphere in the neighbourhood of certain
marshes on the borders of the Mediterranean; and by refer
ence to historical data, and various documents, he has proved
the great importance which attaches to the circumstance of
their being, at times, in communication with the sea, so as to
have a mixture formed between their waters and that of the
sea.    Both ancient and modern authors have announced the
fatal effects produced in the neighbourhood of marshes by
such mixture, and a local belief of the same thing is very
common and strong.
    “On the south of the Ligurian Apennines is a marshy
shore, bounded on the west for twelve miles by the Mediter
ranean, on the south by the river Serchio, and on the north
by the river Frigido, a torrent commencing at the foot of the
 Apennines, in the state of Massa di Carrara, running three
 or four miles over the land, and then falling into the sea.
 The plain is from two to four miles wide, and is traversed by
 a few short torrents or streams; among these are the rivers
 Camajore and Pietra Santa, which divide the plain into three
 separate basins. The rain and spring waters which flow into
 the three basins mentioned, are slowly discharged into the sea
 by natural or artificial canals, penetrating the sand-bank,
 which exist on the sea-side.
    “The level of these stagnant waters is between that of high
and low water in the neighbouring sea; there being but little
 difference between these two points in this part of the Medi
 terranean.    In this state of things, formerly, when the waters
 of the sea arose from any circumstance (unless the waters of
 the marshes were very high), they used to return up the
 ditches, fill the basins, and inundate the country to the foot
 of the mountains; and with a north-west wind, the waves used
 to penetrate with force to the interior.    The mixture of fresh
 and salt water thus   formed,   and which, in summer, was rarely
 changed, became corrupt, and spread infection over the neigh
 bourhood of the most destructive kind.
     “In this way the effects of the malaria were reproduced
 annually in the neighbouring country, with     all their peculiar
 horrors: the population, though small, presented feeble infants

 to avoid the scourge, by living on the hills, or in the interior,
 and frequenting the plain when the business of cultivation
 essentially required    were vain; they fell victims

 excluding the sea from these marshes; and,                      1740–41,              in               a

                                      w.
that there is a prevalent idea, which deserves  investigation,
that the ships in the Medway are liable to greater waste of
their copper than those at             or other places on the
Thames.
     Within               I have seen in the number of Liebig's
               the past week
Annalen for   January   last, that Dr. Clemm examined some
water taken up in December 1839, in the open sea off Bar
mouth, North Wales; also from Aberystwyth and Tenby in
South Wales; and he observes, “In some of the bottles from
the English coast the large proportion of sulphuretted hydro
gen was very striking: both in smell and taste it was con
verted into a strong sulphurous water.”      He seems to think
that the accidental presence of some of the sealing-wax with
which the bottles were closed, may have had something to do
with the generation of the gas.
     By the kindness of Sir Isambard Brunel, I have been favoured
 with the particulars of a very remarkable phaenomenon of this
 kind, which attended the progress of the Thames Tunnel, and
 which proved of great annoyance, and was the cause of great
 suffering to some of the workmen.        This was the evolution of
 great quantities of carburetted hydrogen mixed with sulphu
 retted hydrogen gases. In 1837 the smell was extremely foetid.
“It   frequently rushed out from between the small boards of                                 .
 the shield, used to scour the ground with great force, burstin
 into a flame, which sometimes extended over some feet,                                .#
 was generally accompanied by a loud roaring or hissing noise.”
    In 1838, the sulphuretted hydrogen was unaccompanied by
 the great quantity of carburetted hydrogen with which it had
 been previously mixed, but               its
                                   effects upon the men were very
 severe, producing sickness, giddiness and fainting, pains                              in
 the head, and      one case delirium.
    The source     of in
                    this enormous production         gas may proba

retted waters.   But if paramount duty should oppose itself to
such a course, we have a certain remedy to propose.        You
have seen how   instantly chlorine  destroys the gas.  Chlorine
and sulphuretted hydrogen cannot coexist together. Plentiful
fumigations of chlorine would therefore infallibly prevent the
deleterious effects; and the antidote is at once cheap, and                                       in

pied with researches of this kind, and the attention of the
Academy of Sciences having been directed thereto by M. Hess,
who had had conversations with Dulong on the subject, the
manuscripts which he left behind were examined by Arago,
and the following results obtained.      Dulong had made an
extensive series of experiments on the quantity of heat evolved
in combustion, but did not write out any full description of
his apparatus or methods; M. Cabart, however, who had
been working in Dulong's laboratory, was able to describe the
form of calorimeter which had been used.      A rectangular box
in red copper, of 25 centimetres in depth, 7.5 in breadth, and
 10 in length, is the space in which the combustion is carried
on; the oxygen or other gas supporting the combustion is
introduced by a tube, and the products of combustion carried
off by another. For the precise arrangement

   These results want probably the great accuracy which Du
long would have given to them had he been longer spared to
science; but they probably fluctuate round the true numbers.
We cannot judge of what general conclusions he would have
deduced from them; but one important consequence appears
to follow naturally from the numbers now given, since it ap
pears that the same quantity of oxygen does not evolve the
same quantity of heat in combining with various bodies. Thus
if we deduce from the first table the quantity of heat evolved
by each substance in perfect combustion with a litre of oxygen,
we obtain the following numbers:—

22         Abstract       of recent          Researches on the quantity                       of
   Hess states, in his letter to Arago, that he had taken notes
immediately after a conversation with Dulong, in which the
latter said he had arrived at the following general laws:—
  1st.     That    the quantities of heat evolved are (nearly) the
same      for   the same substance, no matter at what temperature
it burns.
  2nd. Equal volumes of
                                             of all
                            gases,    combining with oxygen,     in
evolve the same quantity    heat.
  3rd. The same quantity     heat    disengaged with the same
                                               of            is
quantity    oxygen, whether

   4th. The quantity      heat disengaged
                                    of         different substances    by

   These conclusions, however, are               means completely
borne out        by
                the experimental    results,      far     they have                      as
been  recovered,  except  the third, which      certainly supported       is

oxide.
     Incommenting              on
                       these numbers, Berzelius has pointed out
a remarkable consequence deducible from them; that              that                               is,

     The laws        of   phaenomena              are very frequently more easily

               Heat evolved in Chemical Combination.                                                         23
examined and established when attention is directed to those
cases in which they act with but moderate activity; the results,
being less sudden and turbulent, become more easily subjected
to accurate measurement and observation.              It has been re
markably so with electricity; and this it is which gives pecu
liar value to the thermo-chemical researches recently entered
upon by Hess and Andrews.             In Poggendorff’s Annalen in
1839, Hess communicated some results on the admixture of
oil of vitriol and water, and announced that when two sub
stances unite in many proportions, the quantities of heat evolved
in these acts of combination are multiple proportions of each
other. To the further development of this law he has since
devoted himself, and obtained a great number of important
results, which we will now proceed briefly to describe.                -
   The instances which first conducted M. Hess to the de
tection of this law, were found in the quantity of heat evolved
by the combination of                      oil   of
                                  vitriol with water. The method
first pursued was       follows:—The strength
                                as                      the dilute sul           of

                            water, and quantities                vitriol          of       oil   of

26    Mr. W. G. Armstrong                     on the      Electricity of Effluent Steam.
    Having thus discovered an instance in which the electricity
was so strongly affected by the contents of the water, I pro
ceeded to try the effects of other ingredients, and the follow
                                                              |.
ing are the results I obtained:—
    Soda had much the same effect as potash, rendering the
electricity of the steam positive, but not occasioning quite so
strong a development.         A minute                 of nitric acid pro
duced the contrary effect, causing the steam to be negatively
electrified.    Muriatic acid had no perceptible influence; nei
ther had   sulphuric   acid, not even when iron filings were con
tained in the boiler.      Lime tended to produce positive elec
tricity, but not powerfully.         Common salt appeared to have
no effect.     Nitrate of  copper     rendered the steam negative, in
nearly the same degree as nitric acid.
    Potash, soda or lime used in excess, always occasioned
what engineers call priming; which is the ejection of water
from the boiler in conjunction with the steam.                  Whenever
this took place the electricity either vanished entirely, or be
came exceedingly feeble.           It is therefore unintelligible to me
how it happens that Dr. Schafhaeutl obtains most electricity
when the steam is combined with water.
    From the powerful effects I obtained, when water contain
ing a little potash was used, I have little doubt that a properly
constructed electro-steam apparatus would answer                         the                        all
purposes      of   anelectrifying machine.          My own apparatus,
though small and imperfect,                       is    no
                                            mean substitute for        elec                         an
trifying machine; and           sharp edges, points, and asperities
                                        if

the gold was constantly accompanied by magnetic ironstone
                       ..
(sometimes in masses of half a hundred weight), by magnetic
ironsand, by cubical and dodecahedral iron pyrites; and in
small pieces and grains, by specular iron ore, brown and red
ironstone, iron           fragments of tinstone crystals, wolfram,
gray ore of manganese, pieces of quartz and chlorite, and
sometimes fragments of quartz crystals.          I observed and col
lected also some specimens, which show that the gold, mag
netic ironstone, and wolfram, were each of them frequently                                           in
termingled with quartz; and I have also a few specimens
 which exhibit the gold not only incorporated with iron ochre,
but ramifying in slight threads through wolfram.
    To satisfy and amuse some of my county of Wicklow friends
at the time, I made an assay of the fragmentary crystals of
 tinstone, showing to them as good metallic             was ever pro tin   as
duced     inCornwall.

 county of Wicklow”, from which                          I
                                               have drawn most of the
 preceding details.        In that memoir I also showed that tin
 ore was not confined to the county of Wicklow, but that it had
 been found in the county of Dublin also, though under dif
 ferent circumstances, for which discovery we were indebted to
 Dr. Thomas Taylor, then living in Dublin, but latterly re
 siding on his property at Dunkerrin Castle, in the county of
 Kerry.       The information on this subject, derived from that
 gentleman, I have embodied in the 18th section of my memoir
  (at p. 135 of vol. v. Geol. Trans.), in which, in speaking of the
 granite region, I have said, “The minerals which                   have                   I
 incidentally observed disseminated in the granite, or imbedded
 in the contemporaneous veins of granite and quartz that tra
 verse the rock (which more particularly form their native
 seat), are schorl, tourmaline, garnet, beryl, rock-crystal, epi
 dote, heavy spar, magnetic iron ore, galena, copper pyrites,
 and iron pyrites.       But in addition to these, I am indebted to
 Dr.   Taylor    for the information that he has discovered in the
 granite, malachite, arsenical pyrites, tinstone, spodumene, and
a new mineral, to which he has given the name of killinitef.”
 And in a note upon the tinstone thus found, I have added,
“It    is an interesting fact that this metal should at length have
 been discovered in rock in this country, although found only
in a contemporaneous vein traversing a loose block of granite;

                       in              Wicklow,

     We have thusit       upon  record that tin ore has been found
in   three distinct localities       Ireland, two
                                      in                 the county    in                         of
 Wicklow, and one           the county
                            in              Dublin; the latter being

     Mr. M.   Roberts on the Electric and Nervous Influences. 31
inserted in the address delivered at the first annual meeting
of the Geological Society of Dublin by their President, I then
extracted from my memoir on the East of Ireland certain
details, in which the occurrence of tin ore in connexion with
native gold in both Croghan Kinshela and Croghan Moira
 mountains is again mentioned.
     We have it thus four times in evidence in print, dating
 from the year 1801 to 1835, that tin ore does occur in Ire
 land, to which Dr. Smith's testimony in 1840 now adds a
 fifth; and this independently of what may be found in the
 printed proceedings of the Dublin Society in the early part.
 of this century. But it follows from the preceding, that Dr.
 Smith, in his examination of the washed sand lately procured

 V.    On the Analogy between the Phaenomena of the Electric and
     Nervous Influences. By MARTYN Roberts, Esq., F.R.S.Ed.*
  1.      LTHOUGH much has been said by eminent physio
           logists in endeavouring to prove that an essential di<U+017F>
 ference exists between the nervous and the electric power,
 yet there are so many points of                 untouched by these
 writers, and the facts they have adduced are so susceptible of
 explanation by electrical laws, that I feel convinced there is
 the greatest similarity, if not identity, between the nervous
 and electric influence, both in their mode of action and in the
 phaenomena produced.
     2. In the first place, I may call attention to a beautiful ana
 logy which has, I believe, hitherto escaped observation, viz.
  the influence of electricity on the circulation of fluids; and
  there is just cause for believing that a like influence governs
  the circulation of the blood in the living body.
     3.  If  we calculate the force of the heart, we shall find it
  wholly inadequate to propel the blood through the fine capil
  lary vessels of the system, unless it be assisted by some other
  power. There are two sources of resistance to the motion of
  fluids in tubes, at least two that especially apply to the motion
  of the blood through the vascular system, viz. the tortuosities
  of the tubes, and the adhesion of blood to the sides of the chan
  nel through which it is impelled.
     4. The resistance occasioned by the deviation of a channel
  from a straight line is easily overcome when the motion of the
  fluid in it is slow; for this resistance is the destruction of the
  momentum, or tendency of the fluid to move in straight lines,

34     Mr. Martyn Roberts                      on the        Analogy between the
ries, capillaries, and veins of a dead body; this pressure, on a
syringe of one and a half inch in diameter, would be about
four pounds; and surely every one will allow that a force of
four pounds thus applied would be insufficient to inject the
whole body, even with a liquid much less viscid and adherent
than blood, and if not sufficient to inject           how much less     it,                              to

continuous flow              of
                         blood through the capillaries, but cannot
force it  onwards.          has been fully proved
                                It                          Müller, Ber        by
 zelius, Hodgkin and others, that the coats              the arteries are     of

                               I

                           their non-muscularity, for         believe this
is  now the    generally    acknowledged     structure        the arterial         of I

   13. We may then rest satisfied that the arteries                mea                       in   no

the necessity           of
                    acknowledging that                         as
                                               the heart's force                                    is   in

               overcome the adhesion between the blood and the
parietes     the capillaries, there must

    their parietes with every particle of blood that passes through
    them; whereas, in those capillaries, where two or three glo
    bules can pass simultaneously, a smaller amount of neuro
    electric influence is required, for the globules are further re
   moved from the parietes of the tube, and therefore less under

       16. Secondly. Inflammation may be considered as an                                                  in
  creased neuro-electric action on the capillaries, which electri
           these vessels and the blood to a higher degree than in
  their   healthy   state, the adhesion is still further diminished; in
  those capillaries where red blood before circulated, it now flows
  in increased quantity; and in those which only admitted lymph
  in the healthy state, red globules now enter, as may be seen
  in inflammation of the conjunctiva, &c. The second stage of

a   change       of
                 nervous    action,  and there are many proofs               these              of
phaenomena being entirely                           upon the nerves leading

86       Mr. Martyn    Roberts on the Analogy between the
to the parts affected; thus it has been found that no inflam
mation ensues on the application of irritants to the eye, if the
fifth nerve expanded upon the conjunctiva be divided; the ap
plication of ammonia to an eye thus injured produced no effect,
while on the other eye of the animal, the nerves of which re
mained untouched, a similar application produced a violent
inflammation.
    20. It has also been proved that division of the pudic nerve
completely arrested the power of producing turgescence in the
singular structure of the corpora cavernosa, discovered by
 Müller.
    21.  The  phaenomena   of blushing can be easily explained if
we allow that an affection of the mind produces an increased
neuro-electric action in the face and neck, which by compen
 sating for the resistance offered by the capillaries in these parts
 to the flow of blood, they are easily injected by the force of the
 heart, and that suffused     appearance called blushing      is the
 result.
     22. The languid circulation in paralysed limbs is the effect
 of a deficiency of neuro-electric action; there is a greater re
 sistance offered to the passage of blood through the paralysed
 capillaries, a slow and difficult circulation ensues, and when
 this happens to excess, those vessels that before admitted the
 red globules, now only receive lymph, and a paleness of the
 part is the consequence, with diminished nutrition.
     23. These several phaenomena tend to prove that a change
 of nervous action in the capillaries is sufficient to cause an   in
 creased or diminished circulation of blood through them, and
 I  have shown this may be accomplished in inorganic bodies
 by a change in their electric condition, and I trust the ana
 logy has been proved to be complete between this and the
 nervous or neuro-electric action in the living body. Were any
 thing wanting to confirm the present hypothesis, I may add,
 that microscopic observation shows us the red globules of
 blood passing through the capillaries in a state of extreme
 self-repulsion, and also removed from the sides of these tubes.
     24. I anticipate, with some degree of satisfaction and con
 fidence, that the new theory I have here ventured to propound
 of the forces tending to motion of the blood, will have the
 effect of increasing our pathological knowledge of the various
 changes in the circulation, and clear up many of those obscu
 rities that have long retarded the progress of medical sci
 Cince.
     25. The question may be asked, whence is this electricity
 or the neuro-electric power of the body derived?          I answer,
 by respiration from the atmosphere; for oxygen gas, in com

hourly combines with the blood or          carbon; and there                 its                                         is

    The slight excess in the carbon is probably owing to a
little of the cinnamic acid having escaped decomposition.
    Peroxide of lead is therefore a more elegant test for cin
namic acid than nitric acid, as there are no fumes, as is the
                                                                                                           in oil

of   bitter almonds, the taste                       of   which       is    easily perceptible

   Hypochlorite              of
                    lime also converts cinnamic acid into ben
zoic, but the oily liquid which     then formed      not    is                         is            oil   of

weight of salicone, I do not think it worth while deducing
any formula from these numbers.        When salicine is destruc

of Artern in such small particles as to escape observation.
According to Wöhler's experiments, however, this is not the
case. The substance which remains after the mineral has been
treated with carbonate of ammonia is alumina; but it always
contains a little mellitic acid, probably as basic salt, for on

 It  then forms a black mass, which does not contain zinc. On
 heating very slightly, even on paper, it becomes instantly
 white, and is changed into euchronic acid. This is exactly
 the same as with the deoxidized indigo, only vice versä with
 regard to the colours.      Wöhler therefore proposes for this
 blue   body   the name of Euchron. It is soluble in ammonia
 and the alkalies, yielding splendid purple colour; but the solu
 tion decolorated with great rapidity.      If a solution of proto
 chloride of iron be mixed with a solution of euchronic acid
no change is produced, but on addition of an alkali a volumi
nous violet-coloured precipitate is produced, which oxidizes
in the air with the greatest rapidity.         By the action of zinc
on a    boiling solution of euchronic acid an almost impercep
tible quantity of gas (hydrogen or ammonia) is evolved, but
this is doubtless a secondary product; a white powder is
formed in small quantity at the same time; it appears to be
mellitate of zinc. A hot solution of euchronic acid forms, in
a dilute solution of nitrate of silver, a yellow precipitate, which
is dissolved again on shaking, but on cooling is deposited. It
is not dissolved by ammonia, but becomes changed and passes
milky through the filter, &c. The lead salt is obtained by
adding a boiling solution of euchronic acid to a dilute so
lution of neutral acetate of lead. The salt is deposited on
cooling as a yellow powder, or in small yellow crystals. The
filtered   hi<U+017F>     if boiled, deposits white mellitate of lead.
Heated to 160° loses 11:36 per cent. water.           Both this salt
(dried at 160°) and the silver salt, however, still contain water.
The composition of the euchronic acid is C*N* O". Atomic
weight 1694-29. The anhydrous silver salt is 2 Ag + Cº. Nº

salt, dried at 150°, is Pb -- Cº. Nº O + H. O.            The cry
stallized salt is Pb -- C* Nº O' + 5 H. O.          Euchronic acid
heated to 2009 is C*N* O' + 2 Hº O; the crystallized con
tains 2 atoms of water more. The acid euchronate of am
monia, obtained by heating the mellitate, is Nº Hº O + H2
O. C.” Nº O'; it is not changed at 200°. The decomposition
of the mellitate of ammonia is then as follows:–Seven atoms
are decomposed and form 2 atoms of paramid, 1 atom of
euchronic acid, 4 atoms of ammonia, and 14 atoms of water.

   By the conversion of paramid into mellitate of ammonia,
only two atoms of mellitic acid are formed. Moreover, 3 atoms
of paramid = 2 atoms euchronic acid + 1 atom ammonia.
Paramid is bieuchronate of ammonia minus 2 atoms of water.
It is probable that paramid and euchronic acid form in high
temperatures other interesting products.   A deep green sub

Products     of the Action of Nitric Acid on Naphthalin.             By C. de
                         Marignac, of Geneva.
    Laurent has shown that by the action of nitric acid on
naphthalin two products are obtained; when the action takes
place in the cold a substance is formed having the composition
C*H*        Nº O'. Nitronaphthalase (Berzelius's nitrite of the
oxide of Ikodekatesseryl), by the aid of heat, Cº. His N, O =
2 (Clo Hº. Nº O'). Nitronaphthalese (nitrite of the oxide of
Dekahexyl) is produced.          The action of nitric acid does not,
however, cease here; if it be continued two other substances
are formed. When nitronaphthalese is once formed, the acid
acts but very slightly, and no more red vapours are evolved
until the greater part of the nitric acid has passed over, when
the temperature rises and red vapours are formed.               In order
to obtain the      products  thus formed,     De  Marignac    added the
nitric acid to the naphthalin in the retort in small portions,
and waited each time until           action had ceased; the opera

VIII.    On a Paraselene witnessed on May 6th, 1841. By
    W. R. BIRT, Esq., Librarian and Assistant Secretary to the
    Metropolitan Institution.
             To E. W. Brayley, Jun., Esq.
I
     MY DEAR SIR,
    HAD an opportunity last night of witnessing an interesting
    exhibition of paraselene. The halo occurred in a modifi
cation of cirro-stratus, which I have termed nebula suspensa,
in order to distinguish it from other varieties of cirro-stratus.
I  believe it is the only variety that exhibits halos;        I
                                                          do not re
collect at the moment having observed them in others. One
half only of the halo was visible, the moon being low at the
time of observation; this half exhibited three portions, which
were more strongly illuminated than the rest of the semicircle.
The inclosed rough sketch will convey some idea of the posi
tion of these illuminated portions; the semicircle was very
distinct, the base or the diameter joining the two extremities
and passing through the moon, being parallel with the hori
zon. Both these extremities were strongly illuminated as com
pared with the semicircle generally,           É.faint as compared
with the   moon;    these illuminated   portions  were not well de
fined; their appearance did not convey to me the idea of their
being images of the moon, but merely portions of the halo
more strongly illuminated than the rest. Perhaps this little
figure will give the best idea of their appearance.

                   Jupiter.     M.
The darkened portions represent the illuminated portions of the semicircle.
   The illuminated portion at the summit of the semicircle was
very interesting; it was fainter than the portions above men
tioned, and filled a small segment of the halo, in the same
manner as a pencil of rays, diverging from a luminous point,
would illuminate the segment of a ring situated within    cone.       its
This illuminated    portion appeared  somewhat               of
                                                       lozenge    a
form, having the part immediately over the moon brightest
and broadest;     itbecame gradually fainter and narrower to
wards    itseastern and western extremities.    The difference
between      and the illuminated extremities
             it                                        of
                                                 the semicircle
was very  distinct.

IX.       On the Polarization of the Chemical Rays of                                    Light.
            By John SUTHERLAND, M.D., Liverpool*.
     T  has been long known that the invisible rays of the solar
     light, which manifest their presence by inducing chemical
action, are possessed of some of the properties of the luminous
rays.     Their capability of being reflected and refracted must
have been observed at the time of their discovery; and Dr.
Thomas Young proved that they were capable of producing
the phaenomena of interference, by allowing the rays beyond
the violet extremity of the spectrum to fall on paper covered
with chloride of silver, after having been transmitted through
glasses showing Newton's rings.                          }.
                                                same phaenomenon was
also exhibited    directly   by  M. Arago,   who made use of Fresnel's
experiment for the purpose of demonstrating                              it.

I     have succeeded       polarizing the chemical rays:—1st,

 they proceed directly from the sun; 2nd,              they exist      the as                       at
 extreme violet end         of

 sky; and            by
                  three different processes,—double refraction,
 reflexion, and repeated single refraction.            shall describe   I                                in
 succession these processes, with the apparatus used.
     1.   Polarization     of   the Chemical Rays                     by   double Refraction.
  The first important fact    regard     the chemical rays
                                              in                 to                                      is,
that they are susceptible  double refraction,
                                         of     the same man                    in
ner    the luminous rays are. To prove this,
          as                                     prism    cal                     a                of

54              Dr.    J.   Sutherland on the Polarization
careous spar, one and three quarters of an inch in length and
one inch in the side, and polished at each end, was employed.
It was inclosed in a case having an aperture at one extremity,
the other extremity being open.           The extreme violet rays of
the solar spectrum were allowed to pass through the aperture
and to fall on a piece of photogenic paper.                           #.
                                                              very faint
images were formed, and in a minute or two these produced
corresponding dark impressions on the paper.              A similar re
sult was also obtained when the direct sun's rays were em
ployed. By this apparatus two impressions of equal intensity,
each half an inch long and one-eighth of an inch broad, were
obtained; but on extending the experiments I soon found
that a polarized beam of greater size than it could give was
necessary; I therefore substituted a plate of Iceland spar an
inch square and ºths of an inch thick, and in order to                               in
crease the divergence of the rays, one of the planes was ground
to an angle of 63° with the obtuse edge, and both planes were
then polished.        A plate of Iceland spar thus prepared, has
the property of separating the two rays so much, that when
inserted into an aperture admitting a sun-beam into a dark
ened room, it gives two images of polarized light, each one
inch in diameter and about an inch apart, on a screen placed
at the distance of eight feet from the aperture.
    These images, when received on sensitive paper, both pro
duced considerable effect; but the extraordinary more than
the ordinary, and it was therefore chosen for the purpose of
experiment.
    An analyzing apparatus, consisting of six thin plates of
 mica, was placed obliquely in the course of the polarized ray,
 so as to form with          its
                            axis      angle  an         of
                                                 about 25°. The                      in
 strument was turned round until the plane              the mica plates
                                                                  of
 coincided with the     plane     polarization
                                        of         the ray. of
                                                             When this
 was done the light was almost extinguished, and was allowed
to  fall  on   piece     photogenic paper. After the lapse
                            of                                       five       of
 minutesnoa    effect whatever was produced            the paper. The
                                                                 on
 mica plates were then turned round 90°, until their plane was
 at right angles with the plane          polarization.
                                                  of      The light was
 greatly increased         intensity, and
                            in                  one minute the paper
                                                       in
 was   tinged,    in three minutes      good  deala      and      so,
                                                                five mi    in
 nutes     was pretty dark.       This experiment proves that the
 plane of itpolarization       the chemical rays
                                   of                   coincident with
                                                                 is
 that of  the luminous rays         the sun's light.
                                         of
    Instead      the mica plates employed
                of                                 the last experiment,
                                                            in
I  next used the    long  prism      Iceland  spar
                                             of     already mentioned.
 The polarized beam was transmitted along                          it,
                                                         and the prism
 turned    on   its
                  axis until one        the   of
                                            rays  was  extinguished:                 a

                     of the   Chemical Rays     of Light.                      55
piece of sensitive paper received a dark image from the unex
tinguished ray; but the extinguished ray produced no effect
whatever.
   A film of mica was then placed in the course of the polar
ized beam before it passed through the prism, and the ex
tinguished ray immediately reappeared: the two rays were
allowed to fall on sensitive paper, and both produced tints of
equal intensity.
   This experiment was repeated with a film of selenite                        in
stead of the mica: one of the rays was coloured of a yellowish,
the other of a purple tint: on being received on photogenic
paper both the images gave dark impressions, but the purple
image produced more effect than the other.
   The experiment was again repeated with a film of selenite,
which gave a pink colour to one ray and a green colour to
the other; and in this instance both images gave tints of equal
depth to the paper. These experiments go to prove that the
chemical rays, when polarized, are acted upon by thin cry
stallized plates, in a manner similar to that in which the                     lu
minous rays are influenced.           -
      I
      was next desirous of ascertaining whether any phaenomena
resembling the coloured rings seen round the axes of crystals
in polarized light were presented by the chemical rays when
                                      I
polarized, and for this purpose employed an apparatus con
sisting of a tube two inches long and three-fourths of an inch
in diameter: at one extremity of it was placed a double con
vex lens, having a focus of one and a quarter inch: within the
tube, and at the distance of half an inch from the lens, was
placed a section of a calcareous spar rhomb, such as is used
for showing the coloured rings. At the other extremity of
the tube was placed an oblique analyzing bundle of three mica
plates, or one of Nicol's improved prisms, and the appara
tus was so disposed that the polarized sunbeam was allowed
to fall on the lens, and thence through the tube upon a screen
placed close to        An image
                     it.             of
                                     the coloured rings and black
cross was thus obtained, and          byturning the tube 90° upon
its axis, the rings with the white cross appeared; while        this      in
position  a piece     of
                      photogenic paper was used          receive the to
image, and      reversed impression        of
                                          the rings and cross was
obtained;     to a
               wit, the place where the white cross had been
was   dark, the centre light, with     acomplete black ring round
it, and  segments      of
                       other  rings exterior          The tube was
                                                     to   it.
next turned 90° upon          its
                             axis,    so   as   to

      I have also   used a section of rock crystal for the purpose
  of  obtaining   impressions    of      rings, and

to prove that these rays can be polarized by reflexion.              The
apparatus made use of consists of a mirror composed of nine
plates of parallel glass, by which a beam of polarized light
can be thrown upon an analyzing plate of thick flint glass, so
                      angleits   position can        changed, and           be                            its

The image            of
                  the sun, after having been reflected from the
mirror     atthe polarizing angle, was thrown upon the analyzing
plate, the plane               of
                       which had previously been turned             right                           at

                            primitive polarization.     From this plate
the ray was received upon          piece                      of
                                               photogenic paper, and

apparatus being still          the same position, another piece

paper, cut from the same sheet, was substituted for that used
in  the last experiment, and the ray was depolarized               inter                        by
posing    aplate           of
                      mica between the      mirrors;      three minutes          in
the paper received        dark impression, thus affording another

    These three experiments, which occupied little more than
 ten minutes         their performance, were executed

 used was also         equal sensibility; and they afford

 effects of varying intensity, two sets                    of experiments     were     car
 ried on at the same time. A piece           of thin window glass was
   chosen, out of which sixteen plates, one and a half inch long
   and one inch broad, were cut. These were arranged diago
  nally in four bundles, and placed in two tubes; two of the
   bundles having their planes coincident in one tube, and the
  other two with their planes at right angles in the other tube.
  The tubes were placed close to each other in a perpendicular
  position in the open air, so that the light from the sky could
  pass directly through them upon two pieces of photogenic
  paper, cut from the same sheet, and placed so as to receive
  the chemical emanations.         In this position they were left for
  two hours in a    tolerably  clear day; and although the chemical
  rays had to pass through the same number of plates in both
                                    j.
  instances, the impressions received by the paper differed much
 in intensity, that under the tube containing the two bundles
  with the planes at           angles being much less affected than
 the other.     The   explanation    of this phaenomenon is that all
 those chemical emanations which were polarized by the re
 peated refraction of the first bundle of glass plates did not
 pass through the second bundle when their planes were at right
 angles, and consequently produced no effect on the paper;
 but, on the contrary, they passed readily through the second
 bundle, when                 its
                       plane coincided with that                   of

 produced their characteristic darkening effect.               The phae

                                PARK.
 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
    GENTLEMEN,
      OU will oblige me by inserting in your Journal the fol
     lowing brief description of an improvement in the con
struction of the air-pump.
   A model in my possession works very satisfactorily; but,
from want of opportunity, I have not been able to compare
its efficiency with other instruments already        in
                                                   use.      conIt
sists ofa   barrel orcylinder     of
                                 iron truly bored and   polished.
To this cylinder accurately fitted case-hardened iron piston,
                   is                  a
in  the usual manner, the piston-rod working      the upper end
                                                     at

piston, are  number
               a         of
                          very small  apertures,   for the admis
sion and egress    of
                   the air.  At the lower end       another accu
rately  #:   metallic plug, the end        of
                                          which       is is
                                                    perfectly flat,

60                     Mr. Henwood                    on the Temperature
as is the end of the working piston, so that when the latter is
forced down, there is no residuum of air le<U+017F>t in the barrel at
the end of the stroke, between the pistons. There is also a
spring to keep the pistons in close connexion till the upper
one has returned a little past the openings, by which the air
is forced out, a little above which openings the lower plug is
retained by a stay coming against the end of the cylinder.
   It has been objected that, though the model works well at
first, the metallic piston will soon wear, and then the instru
ment will become inefficient.      This may be obviated, I con
ceive, by making the apertures very small, and by using pis
tons packed or covered with some elastic material, as India
rubber, which would easily pass and repass the openings
without tearing or injuring the packing.       But in order to
dispense with the apertures, and to avoid any objection that
might be taken to the use of elastic packing on account of
them, it has occurred to me, that the upper and lower ends
of the cylinder might be made a little wider than the rest of
the barrel, for the inlet and escape of the air.   In this case,
however, the piston rods would require longer collars to serve
as guides, that the pistons might come truly into that part
where they      tight
                 fit     the cylinder.

    Similar remarks from the same respectable authority occur
in the Proceedings of the British Association at the Glasgow
Meeting (p. 186). I fully concur in the statement that a
vacuum may be made so good as to be a drawback on the
performance of the engine in which it is obtained, but I beg
respectfully to represent that this, instead of being now a
novelty, has been long known and acted on.
    Mr. Farey (Treatise on the Steam-engine, p. 375) says,
“Mr. Watt ascertained that if the temperature of the steam
and water contained in the condenser of his engines is re
duced to 100 degrees, then as the steam remaining in the
exhausted space will only have an elastic force equal to a
pressure of not quite one pound on the square inch, it is better
to leave this weak steam always in the condenser, and also
in the cylinder, to oppose the descent of the piston, than to
         §.
throw in any more injection water, which would be requisite
to cool it more, and render it more rare and feeble.”
    So long ago as the year 1828, I had remarked that the
 duty of             engine at Huel Towan, was improved by
 raising the temperature of the hot well within certain limits:
 and I then calculated, for intervals of five degrees extending
 from 80° to 100°, the resistance which the residual vapour
 would oppose to the descent of the piston, the accelerating
 influence it would exercise on the ascent of the air-pump
 bucket, and also the greater or less atmospheric action to
 which that bucket was exposed by the period of discharging
 the hot water being lengthened or shortened.
    The results of these computations appeared in the Edin
 burgh Journal of Science for 1829 (x. p. 41, O.S.), and I
 beg permission to quote the remarks by which they were ac
                                                                -
 companied.
    “The quantity of water (to be discharged by the air
 pump) should be as small as possible, not so much on ac
 count of     weight,
             its          as the greater period during which the

THE    paper before us is a fresh mathematical investigation

experiment for determining the mean density of the earth;
and the author seems to have been in some degree incited to

as the velocity, and as the square of the velocity, he       #.
that the isochronism of the torsion pendulum is not sensibly
affected for small vibrations.      But he does not (as might be
supposed) attempt to assign the small constants which enter
the law of resistance, nor to make the resistance itself affect
the final result.    He examines the effect of the resistance of
the air upon the results of Cavendish's method of finding the
point of repose of the torsion pendulum, and shows that it is
insensible when this point of repose remains in the same place.
    The author then examines the manner in which the mean
density, obtained from the experiment, combined with the hy
pothesis that the earth is composed of spheroidal layers of
variable density, is to be applied to determine the mass of the    .
earth.
    As to the question of mathematics, this paper may be use
ful in pointing out to future investigators a complete mode of
taking into account everything that can affect the result of
 Cavendish's experiment.       But the analysis goes somewhat be
yond the practical necessities of the question; a circumstance
 which is almost inseparable from any attempt to investigate
the conditions of a problem which contains so many unknown
disturbing forces as the one of which Mr. Menabrea             has
treated.

    Challis's Investigation of the Resistance of the Air to an
    Oscillating Sphere.      By the Rev. JAMES CHALLis, M.A.,
    Plumian Professor of    Astronomy   in the University of Cam
    bridge.

       GENTLEMEN,
THE         communication you
       your Number for June,
                                 did me the favour of inserting in
                                  was written under the idea that
some further    explanation   was required from me of my reasons
for  differing in the solution of a hydro-dynamical problem from
 so high an authority as Poisson, and before I was aware that
 Mr. Airy intended offering any additional remarks on the
 subject. That communication is consequently not a direct
 answer to the arguments contained in Mr. Airy's letter in the
 May Number, and I therefore ask permission to add some
 thing in reply. I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible,
 the discussion having, perhaps, already occupied too much of
 your valuable space.

64          Prof. Challis's second Reply to Mr. Airy
    Mr. Airy's reasoning consists of two parts. The object in
the first is to show, that the motion of a fluid, when directed
to or from a centre, must be the same at the same time at all
equal distances from the centre.       In the other it is argued
that motion resulting from two components, one in the direc
tion of a straight line from a centre, the other in a direction
perpendicular to this, is inconsistent with the hydro-dynamical
equations.
    The mathematical reasoning under the first head is the
same as if the problem to be solved had been thus enunciated:—
To determine the motion of a fluid, assuming the whole velo
city to be directed to or from a fired point: in other words,
the motion of a given particle is assumed to be rectilinear. It
will be readily admitted that in this instance the motion is                         al
ways the same at the same distance from the centre, because
if the motions of two contiguous elements at the same distance
were at any instant different, their densities would be different,
and their motions would cease to be rectilinear.      In the case
of motion under discussion, viz. that of fluid put in movement
by an oscillating sphere, the motion of a given particle of the
fluid is obviously not rectilinear, and it is not therefore ne
 cessary for me to show why a solution which I propose for
this case is not included in the more restricted one of recti
 linear motion.
    My concern is rather with the second part of the argument.
The reasoning here is not brought to a conclusion.         By fol
lowing out the investigation I find that not only the three
equations Mr. Airy adduces, but three others also, which
have equal claims for consideration, are exactly verified by
the kind of motion which Mr. Airy considers to be impos
sible.  I   proceed to give the mathematical reasoning.

Napierian logarithm of g, the four hydro-dynamical equations,

ance to an oscillating sphere than to Poisson's, I select the
latter for an example, as affording by the verification of the
equations the most convincing proof of the possibility of the
motion under discussion.
    Poisson first transforms the equation (A.) into one of which
the coordinates are polar, the centre of the sphere being pole,
and takes into account the motion of the sphere. (See Addi

temperature, or that kind of heat which is stopped in greatest
proportion by glass, alum, and (according to M. Melloni)
every other substance.
  2. In the Third Series of these Researches, § 3, I have at
in polarizing heat.        In the month of March 1838, I had established by re
iterated experiments, that the transmission of heat through glass, far from
rendering it less easily absorbed by mica in this peculiar state, had a con
trary effect, and also that heat of low temperature, wholly unaccompanied
by light, was transmitted almost as freely as that from a lamp previously
passed through glass.
     “It even appears, from experiments I have since made with the same form
of mica, that some specimens transmit scarcely half as much luminous heat
previously passed through glass, as that from a body below visible incan
 descence.
     “Mica itself, not laminated by the action of fire, possesses, as I have
 shown by contrasted tables in the paper referred to (Art. 23, 24), properties
 exactly the reverse; hence the effect is due to the peculiar mechanical con
 dition of the body, and not to                         its
                                             elementary composition.

deed every substance which I tried, have a mean refrangibility
superior to that of the rays before such transmission; and as
M. Melloni had been led in a general way by his previous
experiments to a similar conclusion, he inferred, and justly,
that most diathermanous bodies absorb the less refrangible
rays in excess, and therefore are to heat what green, blue, or                                                          .

importance, and especially as it carries our knowledge a step
higher in the scale of truth, by teaching us to refer to the
         of refrangibility certain properties of heat, which be

nature of the source whence it was derived.      Amongst other
things we find, what was long suspected, but what M. Melloni

not an indispensable circumstance.       Again, certain relations
had been established at an early period in the history of the
science of heat, between the colour of a surface and the quan
tity of heat which it absorbed, and this relation for any two
surfaces compared (as black and white, of similar textures),
was first clearly shown by Sir John Leslie, to depend upon
the luminosity of the source of heat, to which conceiving it
proportional, that philosopher based upon it the principle of
his Photometer *.       Professor Powell, of Oxford, conceived
and executed an ingenious experiment, by which it is demon
strated that the interposition of a screen of glass, though it
stops but little light, alters most materially the influence of co
lour on the transmitted heat, thus annihilating at once the
principle of photometric measurement adopted by Leslie, ex
cept in a very limited class of cases+. M. Melloni has fully con
firmed the experiments of Professor Powellf, which therefore
may be considered as establishing this conclusion, that the
quality of blackness or whiteness of a surface affects       power                                          its

 in applying this, I proved that opake glass and mica act as
 clear glass and mica do in elevating the mean refrangibility of
 the transmitted heat.      Hence I concluded that the effect of
 such media upon heat is to absorb the rays of greatest and
 least refrangibility, in short, to act as homogeneous yellow
 glass would do upon light, the mean refrangibility being on
 the whole, however, increased by transmission.         I also pointed
 out that heat from luminous sources is probably far more com
                  of its
 pound in       nature than dark heat; that the darkness          heat                                 of
 is    no
        test        refrangibility; and that even the most refran
                           its
 gible rays may contain heat separable from the light which
 accompanies it”.

 compound emanation from luminous sources.                 Reasoning
 probably upon the conclusions just stated, M. Melloni con
 ceived the happy idea        combining     ofopake substance, such     an
  as smoke, with       solid, which itself should effect
                                 a                             specific                           no

tion of mica induces, in opposition to the natural quality of
the substance (9), the same peculiarity which a film of smoke
possesses relatively to the incident heat.         It is truly for heat
what red glass is for light, it transmits most freely rays of low
 est refrangibility.
    12. Seeing clearly from the first that the change of charac
ter in mica was due to the splitting up into an almost infinite
number of minute surfaces the natural laminae of the mineral
mica; and attributing the character of redness (so to speak) to
the multiplied and irregular reflexions and interferences which
must so take place, it occurred to me as very probable, that
the effect of smoke was due to the superposition of a prodigi
ous number of minute opake points upon a transparent surface,

As most of these results are from single experiments, the first
and the last line must be considered as almost identical, and
certainly do not indicate any material specific difference in the
absorbent qualities of one thick and two thin films of smoke,
which might be expected if the action were a merely superficial
One.
  18.   From these numbers we deduce another conclusion of
some   importance.     Since a film of smoke transmits most
easily heat of low temperature and refrangibility, we may ex
pect that it will-modify the quality of any compound beam of
heat which it transmits, and that one such transmission will
therefore render a second more easy.     Now, we find that the
plate D transmitted 26 per cent. of heat from the first of the
above sources, and that of the 26 rays escaping from D, and
falling upon a second smoked film #. E transmitted 7-3, or
28 per cent. of those incident upon       But     the third line       it.

Here, then, we find the per-centage of transmission raised in
every case by a previous transmission through a rough sur
face. The increased facility of transmission is greater in pro
portion as the incident heat was more heterogeneous; dark
heat undergoes very little change. It appears also by the last
line of the table, that the increased roughness of b compared
to a, had enhanced the characteristic effect (analogous to red

                  was not deceived.     My purpose not being to
investigate fully the subject of diffuse reflexion, I confined my
attention to the establishment of the general fact.       Employ
ing an apparatus which I have not yet described, but which
bears a great analogy to that fi          in the Society's Trans
actions, vol. xiv.  p.  xiii., and described in art. 51 of the
Third Series, I observed the intensity of reflexion of heat
from different sources at a single polished surface of flint-glass,
and at a similar surface depolished with emery. I obtained
at considerable incidences the following striking results as to
the increased susceptibility of heat to be regularly reflected at
a rough surface, when it is of low temperature or refrangibility.

So far then the character of the action of depolished sur
faces is consistent.     The stifling effect (which diminishes both
the reflected and refracted ray) of a rough or laminated surface
diminishes with the refrangibility of the incident heat.        That
the same thing takes place in the reflexion of light we know;
it is probable that it does so in                       its

methods of determining the inequalities of the moon, and the peri
odical inequalities of the planets, which appear to him preferable to
any which have yet been proposed.        He observes, in the Preface to
the   part now before  us, that the expressions for the variations of the
elliptic constants discovered by Lagrange, were not recommended
by that illustrious mathematician to be employed for this determina
tion, although Poisson afterwards advised that they should be used;
but if his valuable life had been spared, the author observes,          is                      “it
possible that his opinions upon this point would have been modified.”
Mr. (now Sir John W.) Lubbock then proceeds to quote a letter
addressed to him by M. de Pontécoulant, in which the methods of
solving the difficult problem of the theory of the moon successively
 employed by Clairaut, d'Alembert, Laplace, Damoiseau and Plana
are summarily discussed; the remarks of M. de Pontécoulant being
introduced by the observation, “it will be seen that they coincide
with the opinions I have expressed in various places during the
course of this work respecting the manner in which the perturbations
 of the moon can be computed with the greatest facility.”
    “The introduction of auxiliary variables,” it is next remarked,
 “offers a wide scope to the imagination.     Recently, M. Hansen has
 proposed to arrive at the expression for the longitude by altering
 the time in the elliptic value.    It is evident that a celestial body
will   have, at any instant, the same longitude which it has at some
 previous or subsequent instant in the elliptic movement; and if this
 difference of time be calculated, the longitude can be obtained from
 the elliptic expression by substituting for the true time some other
 quantity.    The radius vector cannot be calculated from the elliptic
 expression by the same alteration of the time; but M. Hansen gives
 an expression, by means of which subsidiary terms may be obtained,
which, added to the radius vector calculated from the elliptic ex
pression, may give its proper value.”
   M. Hansen's method being applicable to    mechanical problems,    all

so that a is the same function of t + 2 in the disturbed, as of t in
the undisturbed motion.       The two latter of these methods are more
fully developed.
   Thiscase, illustrative of M. Hansen's method, is investigated at large;
and the author, stating that in the more complicated question of the
determination of the longitude of the planets and their satellites,
the reasoning is precisely similar, proceeds to exemplify        applica                                its

   The increased labour, trouble, and difficulty        the method pro                   of
posed by M. Hansen, are then pointed out, and the special discus

        the form of the present planetary tables be abandoned which
give the longitude, and tables be formed which give the value of z,

those figures, and  particularly the quantities b, to a careful exami
nation.
   “Public institutions, established with the view of contributing to
the progress of astronomy, would confer more essential services to
science if their strength were devoted to purposes of this kind
 rather than to the inconsiderate multiplication of unreduced or not
 wanted observations.         The determination of the perturbations of
 the small  planets   is a matter of urgency.       Moreover, the perturba
 tions of the comet which bears the name of Encke, are of too great
 cosmological importance to be properly entrusted to any single
 hand, however skilful and conscientious, or indeed even to a single
 method.     But such troublesome computations, to be conducted with
 a fair chance of success, must be undertaken with the requisite ap
 pliances, and seem therefore properly to fall under the superintend
 ence of those astronomers who are placed in public situations.
 Mutual cooperation upon a uniform system would produce more
 important results than any incoherent computations founded upon
 fantastical expressions.”
    The applicability of the views suggested in the preceding para
 graph to the future proceedings of the British Association, the
 Royal Astronomical Society, and other scientific bodies concerned
 in the reduction of astronomical observations and the formation of
 new astronomical tables, will immediately be perceived.
    The contents of the work itself (in this fourth part), are distri
 buted in the following order:—
    Calculation of the first term in the longitude, appertaining to the
 arguments 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, in illustration of M. Hansen's
 equations.—Calculation of terms depending upon the second approxi
 mation, in further illustration of M. Hansen's equations.—Calcula
 tion of the first term in the reciprocal of the radius vector and of
 the longitude of the moon, by means of the variation of the elliptic
 constants.-On the variation of the arbitrary constants in mechanical
 problems.-On the variation of the semi-axis major of the moon's
 orbit.—On the divergence of the numerical coefficients of certain
 inequalities of longitude in the lunar theory.
    In the calculation of the first term in the longitude, appertaining
 to the arguments 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, in illustration of M.
 Hansen's equations, Sir John Lubbock adopts an equation and ex
 pressions given by M. Encke, in his paper entitled “ Uber             die vom

terms may        calculated  by   his own methods.
    The terms depending upon the second approximation are next

mentary example, the         kind of operations which would be required in
order to determine the periodical inequalities of the moon or planets
by means of the variation of the elliptic constants, as proposed by
Poisson; exemplifies a modification of that method arising from the

     In  order       illustrate this point, the author has selected indiffer

 ently two terms            the longitude amongst those

referred to.
   After this examination he concludes the section, and with       the                                             it

 leading    or principal terms which may occur upon an incomplete
 examination:       hence also the extreme practical difficulty of the
  problem in whatever manner it be approached.
      “In the method which M. Plana has adopted, first, the mean lon
 gitude of the moon is obtained in terms of the true longitude, and
 the true longitude is afterwards found in terms of the mean longi
 tude by reversion.      But the divergence of the numerical coefficients
 exists equally in the former expression, and does not arise in the
  operation of reversion.”
      A note is appended “On the Calculation of the Distance of a Comet
from the Earth.”        Sir J. Lubbock having in his former Treatise on
  that subject (noticed in our fourth volume, p. 219) considered the
 position of the comet and of the sun to be defined by longitude and
  latitude, deduces, in this note, from the equations given in that trea
 tise, those which must be employed if the positions of the comet
  and sun are defined by right ascension and declination ; after which
  he successively examines the equations of Legendre and Lagrange
  (showing the former to be preferable), notices the equation recom
  mended by Mr. Airy, and the solution of Laplace; and concludes
  as follows : —
      “If observations of right ascension and declination be employed,
  the trouble of calculating the observed longitudes and latitudes is
  avoided, but additional terms are introduced explicitly into the final
  equations from which the distance of the comet is sought, and
  which may be considered as identical, whichever data are em
  ployed.”

          College, Cambridge.      Weale, 59, High Holborn, 1841.
      This subject belongs to a class of questions intermediate be
 tween Natural Philosophy and Pathology, the research of which
  as a branch of science has been recommended by Bacon in his
  Novum Organum.
      Suggestions on this particular question have been made by New
  ton, Harris, Wood, Herschel and other optical writers, but which
  cannot be considered as completely accounting for the phaeno
  menon.
      The author considers “that the parts immediately acted upon by
  any exciting power, do perceive.”       This position admits of dispute;
  it is well known that   during   the Taliacotian process, an injury in
  flicted on the new-made nose is felt on that part of the forehead
  from whence the skin had been removed (see Johnstone on Sensa
  tion). We have only room to notice two, out of many ingenious
  experiments by the author.         Let C be an object looked at, and
  P one    interposed.   Two   images   of P will appear. If P be moved
  towards   C,  those images  will mutually, and equally approach
                                                               -  towards
  coalescing.

tionary, the other proceeding alone to coalesce with                                     it.
   From similar experiments, and some physiological considerations,
the Doctor infers that one eye may         regarded               be

wholly occupied with vision, the other being nearly       wholly pas                       or a
sive. This tract will repay perusal.
   The author concludes     with the following problem, which had
                                            it
been treated already     Wollaston,    by
                                     viz. “When      picture looks                                                  at

author's solution seems simple and satisfactory.

   This increased rapidity is accompanied with an increased sharp
ness and distinctness in the outlines of the objects—an effect which
is very advantageous and pleasing, and at the same time rather dif
ficult to account for.
   The shortest time in which I have yet succeeded in impressing an
image in the camera obscura has been eight seconds; but I do not
mean to assign this as the precise limit, for it can only be ascertained
by more careful and multiplied experiments.
   The production of the image is accompanied with some very ex
traordinary circumstances, to which I will advert in a subsequent
letter. These phaenomena are extremely curious; and I have not
found in chemical writers any mention of anything similar.
   The image, when obtained, must of course be fixed, otherwise
the process would remain imperfect.              It might be supposed, a priori,
that this fixation would be very difficult, the paper being so sensitive.
But it fortunately happens that, in this instance, what seems a rea
sonable inference is not borne out by fact, that new photographs
are more easily and perfectly fixed than was the case with the
former ones.       When fixed, a great many copies may be made from
them; and thus the original view can be multiplied with facility.
   I think that the art has now reached a point which is likely to
make it extensively useful. How many travellers are almost ignorant
of drawing, and either attempt nothing, or bring home rude unin
telligible sketches .        They may now fill their portfolios with ac
curate    views,   without much expenditure of time or trouble; and
even the    accomplished     artist will call in sometimes this auxiliary aid,

 when wearied with the multiplicity of               minute details. its

it afterwards, as M. Rose had done, in a long weighed tube of glass,
the lower end of which was closed. He ascertained the quantity, and
immersed the tube in hot water. There was but little moisture dis
engaged, and it was very probably hygrometric, and the residue, which
was converted into common phosphorus, was weighed, and found
scarcely diminished.
   In order to verify the assertions of M. Mulder, the author put
white sticks of phosphorus into aerated water; he left them in it for
several weeks without perceiving any alteration of colour; he then
directed upon them a current of oxygen gas, without producing any
sensible effect.  He obtained, as M. Mulder did, the compound of
oxide of phosphorus  and phosphuretted hydrogen, and found that it
strongly resembled the white crust; but the manner in which it was
acted upon by heat, he found to be very different.
   M. Marchand concludes, therefore, from his experiments, that the
supposed white crust is merely, as was first supposed by M. Rose,
phosphorus in an altered state of aggregation.—Journal de Pharmacie,

   M. Boussingault states that this acid is obtained by dissolving
sugar of gelatin in weak nitric acid.  It is to be slightly heated, and
on cooling the solution crystallizes;  no other reaction takes place
besides the mere dissolving of the sugar in the acid. This acid has
a very sour taste, and also a slightly saccharine one.     M. Boussin
gault analysed it in three different states: crystallized, dried, and
as it exists in salts.

102               Mr. Grove           on some Electro-Nitrogurets.
    From the specific gravity of the cadmium compound                       ex                             I
pected it to have yielded more nitrogen, and from the yellow
colour of the residue                 I
                                   consider that some of this element,
with probably hydrogen, formed a new combination ana
logous to that of ammonia and potassium examined by Sir
Humphry Davy; to enter upon this analysis will require a
new series of experiments, foreign to the immediate purpose
of this paper. Another question of difficult resolution                                                             is,
whether the hydrogen expelled from the zinc compound was
in   immediate combination,                      or
                                           resulted from the reaction                                               of
the zinc upon combined water:                  incline   I   the opinion that
                                                                           of to

same heat which would expel the water would decompose the
substance.       Although           had no expectation
                                      I                           procuring          of                             a

herent power of resistance to the reception of electric fluid,
existing in a greater degree in copper than in iron; and if I
understand him rightly, he supposes this to be not a less
facility of conduction in the copper, but a resistance to the
entrance of the electric fluid into the substance of the metal
from another conducting medium in contact with it; that is
to say, it is more difficult for electricity to enter copper from
an acidulated solution in which this metal is immersed, than
to enter iron in like circumstances, although the copper is
actually a better conductor than iron when the electric fluid
has once penetrated        substance. This grant

 1st, When comparing a ten-pair iron-zinc with a ten-pair
 copper-zinc battery, that although in a given time of con
 siderable duration a much greater quantity of water was de
composed by the iron than by the copper battery, yet that at
the first immersion of the plates in acid a much more rapid
decomposition was effected by the copper than by the iron
combination, although in a very short time this superiority
disappeared, and the iron became the strongest.
    2ndly. When a single pair, copper-zinc, was tried against
a similar pair, iron-zinc, and their powers tested by a differ
ential galvanometer; at the first immersion the deviation was
in favour of the copper, but in a short time the iron overcame
it by a deviation of fifty degrees.
    3rdly. When these pairs were inspected at intervals, it was
seen that the iron preserved a bright metallic surface, while
the copper was covered by a dark coat of oxide.
    4thly. A copper-zinc pair was tested against an iron-zinc
pair of equal surface, to ascertain the comparative loss of
metal by oxidation and solution during the working of these
little batteries, which were allowed to remain in action for
about twelve hours; result as follows:–

of polish produce a variation in the proportion of not less than
3 to 1 in the quantity of transmitted radiated heat from dif
 ferent sources, can we employ salt plates with the ordinary
 degree of polish, and yet consider them as equally transparent
 for every kind of heat, as M. Melloni's discovery has hitherto
 entitled us to do? (2.) Is the effect of roughness common to
 other substances as well as rock-salt? (3.) The operation of
 depolishing with sand-paper is nothing more than the making
 of an infinite number of distinct grooves on a polished surface;
 supposing these grooves to be regularly formed, and capable
 of numerical estimation, will the effect continue 2
    27. (1.) With respect to the first of these questions, it is
 satisfactory to be able to answer it affirmatively in a general
way.     I took two salt plates, of which the surfaces had not been
regularly polished for a long time, and which, though bright
and clear, were by no means particularly even and true.              Of
heat from Locatelli's lamp previously si<U+017F>ted by glass, these
four surfaces of rock-salt transmitted 72 per cent. With dark
heat from smoked brass the per-centage was 73, a difference
which, in this experiment, could hardly be considered as ap
preciable.      The transmission of these two very different kinds
of heat was therefore equal. M. Melloni has shown that when
rock-salt is pure and perfectly polished, '92 of the incident
heat is transmitted by a pair of surfaces, and therefore four
surfaces should transmit ('92)" or 84.5 per cent. This esti
mate I have verified, and am satisfied of
                                                                   it its

     30. Metallic Gratings.-If the mere defect of transparency
 were the cause of the peculiar action of scratched surfaces,
 we might expect that any opake filaments would act in the
 same way.        Could we dispense with the medium altogether,
 and employ a screen, which should have the qualities which
 we had artificially given to the physical surface of the medium,
 we should evidently have advanced a step in the interpretation
 of the phaenomena. The action of grooved surfaces andgratings
 upon light suggested so forcible an analogy, that before I was
 able to procure the mechanically striated surfaces, described in
 the last article, I had employed fine metallic wire-gauze as a dif
 fraction-screen, hoping to obtain results similar to those which
 I  anticipated, and afterwards did obtain, by drawing fine lines
 upon rock-salt.
    31. The fact that diffraction-phaenomena in light, produced
 by gratings, are wholly irrespective of the nature of these gra

case in most manufactured wire-gauze.     One set of wires is
nearly parallel and straight, but not so the set interlaced with
the former, which do not generally make their intersections at
right angles, and hence,               the interstices are some
what smaller than a calculation proceeding upon the number
of wires per inch, and their diameter would give. Distrust
ing my own observations, I put three specimens of wire-gauze
into Mr. John Adie's hands, requesting him to determine the
mean diameters and intervals of the wires.      With a very ac
curate micrometer he determined 14 values for each of these
quantities in both directions.  From these data the proportion
of the interstices to the whole surface of each grating is easily
calculated, and the results are given below for three sorts of

The differences for each grating, perhaps, do not exceed the
errors of experiment. In every case these numbers are infe
rior to the geometrical interstices, but what inclines me to
think that this difference is due to the irregularities of figure
of the gauze (including the effect of flattening of the wires
where they overlap, making the interstices obtuse-angled) is
this: that No. 2, in which the wires were finer compared to
the interstices than in others (the total interstices being one
third part larger in proportion), and the gauze evidently far
more regularly formed than in the other cases, the per-cen
tage transmitted differs very little from the geometrical gauge.
I  own, at the same time, that a difference of 5 per cent. in No.
8 (which is evidently not due to an error of observation), seems
 to me barely accounted for by this remark.

Tºndth inch apart, used for showing Fraunhofer's Spectra,                               I
 obtained a similar result. These threads were arranged paral
lel-wise on two frames, capable of being superimposed rectan
gularly. Thus, we can either employ a screen of parallel
threads one-hundredth of an inch apart, or a screen of mathe
matically accurate squares, formed by superposition.         It is
difficult in this case, however,  to obtain  the  diameter of  the
thread accurately enough to estimate the ratio of interstices.

       Action of Powders.--Adhering to the idea (12.) that
the action of a smoked surface was due to the mechanical ac
tion of a number of minute opake points distributed over
a transparent body, it occurred to me almost at the com
mencement of these experiments, to try the effect of powders
artificially sifted on such a surface. Any ingredient, how
ever, which could make the powders adhere to the surface,
would hae vitiated the experiment, by introducing       own                  its

proper diathermancy.            I therefore included the powders be
tween two      polished     plates   of rock-salt, closed at the edges
 with wax. The      preliminary      experiment (27.), to show that the
salt surfaces, in the state in which I commonly employed
them, exercise no perceptible influence on the quality of the
transmitted heat, was evidently a very important one for the
conclusions              I
                  meant to draw.          It was, as I have stated, quite
satisfactory.
   36. The first experiments which I made with powders
(December 6, 1839), were with chalk and alum, finely dusted
between two plates of salt.            I selected the chalk on account
of   its
       absolutely uncrystalline and opake character; and alum,
because       powerits      stopping rays

vie with the diamond scratches on the salt surface, which
presented, under the microscope, an irregular furrow, pro
bably nearly grºundth of an inch in mean breadth,      –  I recurred
to the project of using the metals in powder.       It was evident,
from the experiments on depolished and scored surfaces, that
the irregularity of these streaks had nothing whatever to do
with the phaenomenon of checking rays of high refrangibility
and admitting others.        Sand-paper scratches, than which
nothing can be more irregular, produced the effect, and that
more intensely as the surface became more coarsely and
closely furrowed.      Nay, it occurs in natural tarnish, where
there can be no linear arrangement of the points affected.
It seemed to me, therefore, that a surface covered with a
metallic powder, presented the limit of a grating where the
interstices were not required to have any regular form.
    40. The next difficulty was to obtain impalpable powders
 indubitably metallic, to which I attached very considerable
 importance, for it was quite conceivable that the metallic sul
phurets and other substances employed for the fictitious me
 tallic powders called gold, silver, and copper bronzes, might
 have specific diathermancies which might injure the experi
 ment. I at length succeeded in obtaining silver by precipi
 tation, and copper from Daniell's battery; and with some
 difficulty I procured from a large manufacturer coinage silver
 and gold, reduced by mechanical trituration to a perfectly
 impalpable and beautifully metallic powder.         These expen
 sive  preparations  are now  wholly  superseded  by  the admirable
 fictitious bronzes in use in the arts. These, together with
 metallic copper-bronze, perfectly impalpable, furnished by
 the same individual, and a much coarser        tinpowder used       by
 druggists, formed the material     of

   47. So far as the eye could judge of the proportion of ob
stacles in surfaces strewed with different kinds of powders,
there did not seem any very marked peculiarity in their trans
parency for heat. A surface dusted with alum or citric acid
appeared to transmit nearly as much as one strewed with
powdered rock-salt.     Nor could this arise merely from the
minute thickness of the substance, which is well known to pro
duce in heat, as in light, an approximation to a colourless
character; for the proportion stopped by the powder was                                                 al
ways a large fraction (usually from #ths to 1%ths) of the inci
dent heat. The opacity, then, is the result of the innume
rable reflexions and interferences which scatter and stifle the
transmitted heat; and this is almost equally effectually done,
whatever be the nature of the substance.           On reflection,
therefore, this general result does not appear surprising.                                                    I

pulverized crystalline bodies, such as rock-salt, alum, citric

an excess of heat of low temperature, depending on their
powdery form. . The carefully repeated experiment with

gest
      iº.       of no small interest with regard to light, and
especially the phaenomena of absorption.
   59. We have already (24.) noticed the analogy which the
fact stated in the last article bears to the easier reflexion of
red than violet light from depolished surfaces, and in that
fact we find a confirmation of the application of the undula
tory doctrine to heat, and of the opinion that the waves pro
ducing heat are longer in proportion as the temperature of
the source is less.   The phaenomena of transmission are more
obscure; they may be compared either to the diffraction, or
to the absorption, of light.
   60. The action of lines on polished surfaces, similar to
those used in many diffraction experiments, led to the                                                in
quiry (31.) whether the mean colour of light transmitted by
gratings was necessarily unchanged?            The question does not
seem to have occurred to       any  one to whom I have mentioned
it;  and though the most likely result would seem                be, that                an to
there should              be   no

of the spectrum. A small variation in the thickness of the
film transmits or annihilates by interference each colour of
the spectrum in succession.    If the waves of heat be much
more heterogeneous (as I have already surmised) than those
of light, such effects would be proportionably more sensible.
   64. Possibly a grooved surface may be considered as pre
senting a number of polished surfaces, partially detached from
the general surface, under small obliquities to the incident
rays; and we may suppose that these rays, after separation
by partial reflexion and refraction, reunite with unequal re
tardations, producing first a destructive effect upon the shorter
waves, and suffering the others to persevere.     I have already
adverted to the   fact, that most turbid fluids transmit chiefly
the longer luminous waves.      I offer these, however, but as
vague conjectures upon a very obscure subject.       I think that
experiments on the colour of media, such as those we have
employed, and especially of depolished plates, might not be
without value in illustrating the phaenomena of absorption in
optics.
   65. In conclusion, it might perhaps be expected that                                         I
should take some notice of the experiments and reasonings of
which M. Melloni has addressed an account to M. Arago, in
two letters dated the 4th and 14th of March last, and pub
lished in the Comptes Rendus for the 30th of the same month.
These letters were occasioned by the announcement of my
Researches, in the same work, for the 6th of January.       The
present paper, founded solely upon experiments undertaken
and completed before the despatch of the earliest of M. Mel
loni’s communications, will,                      I
                                  think, sufficiently answer all
the  questions which are started in his letters to M. Arago, at
least  all
         those    which my experiments are concerned.

 126                 Professor Booth on a new Theorem in the
different, so Poinsot, on the other, having shown that the
methods pursued were fallacious, and the results themselves
false, has given the true development by a method complex
in the extreme, founded on the principles of a higher analysis
than is generally introduced into such investigations.
   It appears somewhat strange, that even since the correct
series has been given, the erroneous developments should
have been retained in some recent publications on the subject.
    In the following pages the method pursued will be found
different from those generally adopted in the investigation,
no principles being assumed beyond such as may be deduced
from elementary algebra; while the method of determining
the coefficients of the expansion, by the aid of the fundamental
theorem first established, will, it is hoped, be considered
simple.

integer n, and h being any finite number whatsoever, then we
shall have the following theorem:—

    the summer of last year, 1839, I went to the top of Snow
IN don,  and found the whole of the mountain covered with
a   thick mist or cloud. While descending from the upper part
of   it,
      about two o'clock      the afternoon,in  looked back and     I
observed the summit quite free from cloud.           June last                  In                  I

                              of the Cumulus Cloud.                                              137
similar clouds formed, but they were more broken and irregu
lar.  At one time, when the morning mist had been raised,
say apparently 100 or 150 yards above the surface, a most
beautiful view was presented.   An indefinite number of thin
clouds seemed to be hung vertically in the air, of various de
grees of transparency, with spaces intervening, so as to give
a sufficiently distinct view of the lower part of each film of
cloud. The whole looked like an immense hall with a mix
ture of glass and thin muslin drapery suspended in the upper
part, the particular appearances changing every few minutes.
Between these vertical films of cloud there appeared to be
slight tremulous upward movements of the air, similar to those
which are seen over heated sands or over the top of a hot
stove, indicating that there were ascending currents of air in
those places. Similar appearances were presented at other
times, but they were less clear.
    In watching such scenes, one of the most striking circum
stances presented to the notice is the formation of the cumu
lus cloud.       It takes so definite a form, has such an uniformity
of character, appears so plainly to grow up before your eyes,
 and ascend from the surface of the land or water to a consi
derable elevation in the heavens, and is so grand in                  appear          its
ance, that      becomes invested with
               it                              peculiar interest. The pre

The part           the atmosphere near the earth which thus ascends
has within          some certain quantity             steam     of              or
                                                                  elastic aqueous
vapour.         When the air rises                           an

consequently sufficiently cooled,                 part      athis steam of     con                 is
densed.         A   new  process     now takes place. Upon the conden
sation   of   this portion              of
                                  steam, latent caloric,          caloric      elas or             of
ticity, is   liberated, and this caloric attaches itself               surround          to
ing bodies, and raises their temperature.                          this way beds    In
or   strata   of   warm air are formed                 different heights

atmosphere.
    But if     liberated caloric raises the temperature                  masses           of                 of
air   floating     high        up  the atmosphere, we know that those
                                    in
masses will expand through the increase                                       of

The additional elastic force thus acquired must                        exerted           be                  in
all directions, but                as
                               there will be the least resistance from
above the force will                be

direction, and the whole column above will be raised, and
caused      to  expand laterally           the higher regions

sation, being exerted, and              part  a             of
                                                   the atmosphere raised and

 often above 52°, steam cannot be said to form at any time here
 much more than 1 per cent. of the atmosphere.       The gases
 then  being considered as  99,  and steam as  1, the liberated
 caloric would attach itself to a much greater extent to the
 gases than to the remaining steam.      The elasticity of the
 gases would be thereby increased; they would spring up, and
 carry the remainder of the steam with them to a sufficient
 height to cause fresh condensation to take place, and thus the
 process might be continued; not only is steam a very small
 portion of the whole atmosphere, but it cools according to a
 different law to that which regulates the cooling of the gases,
 and the difference in the laws by which the steam and the
 gases cool, causes the latter to cool the former.  In ascending
 in the atmosphere,   it is found that, when undisturbed by re
 cent condensation, the temperature is reduced about 1° for
 every hundred yards of elevation. But the steam and the gases
 separately cool nearly according to the following table, taking
 whole numbers in a regular series as a sufficient approxima
 tion to the truth for our present purpose :—

   Here we see that in an ascending column of steam and
gases intermixed, while the former would by their ascension
 cool by expansion only one degree, the latter would cool five
 degrees; the gases, therefore, in their ascent would act the
 part of coolers to the steam. Being intimately intermixed the
 colder body would abstract heat from the warmer, and practi.
 cally the gases when they rise must cool the steam that is                       in
 termixed with them. Then, as the steam is condensed more
 caloric is given out, and the gases again warmed and ex
 panded; and thus these different elastic fluids, condensable
 and non-condensable, act and react upon each other, and give
 results different from those which would be found if they ex
 isted in the atmospheric space separately from each other.
 A portion of the atmosphere, nearly saturated with steam,
 being raised by a force acting from below to a height of
 1700 feet, the steam within it would be cooled, according to
its  own law          of
                   cooling, 1°; but the gases,                   by
                                                      their different
law   of cooling,  would            be
                              cooled 5°; and    these fluids would
                                                            as
be   intimately intermixed, the lower temperature          the gases  of
                                                    of be

steam, and        partial condensation
                     a                      the latter must follow.
This condensation we have seen would give out caloric, which,
by  raising the temperature       the remaining steam, would cer
                                         of

                               of the Cumulus Cloud.                                 141
tainly have a tendency to prevent further condensation;               but
the temperature of the gases would also be raised, and their
elastic force increased: they would therefore rise higher, and
the remaining steam would be mechanically carried up with
them sufficiently high to produce further condensation. That
the liberated caloric would expand the gases enough to cause
them to rise in the atmosphere is apparent, as it requires but
little caloric to give considerable additional elasticity to the
atmospheric gases.        And on the condensation of steam much
 latent caloric is  given    out, there would therefore be an ade
 quate supply of caloric to produce the effects named. It has
 been computed that the evolution of heat from the condensa
 tion of a pound of steam would be sufficient to raise the tem
 perature of 3657 cubic feet of air 10°. Every pound of rain or
  cloud that is formed, will consequently raise the temperature
  of the atmosphere to that proportional extent.
      This view, thowever, does not rest entirely on theoretical
  reasoning; that there are beds of warm air mixed with floating
  particles of water occasionally found in the atmosphere, is
  known from the experience of aeronauts, as well as from others
  who have ascended mountains.           Mr. Green found such a bed
  at a height of nearly 10,000 feet from the earth, where the dew
  point was at 64°, the same as at the surface of the earth at the
  time. At 11,060 feet, only 1.060 feet higher, the dew-point had
  fallen to 32°, only one half the temperature; because, there is
  no doubt, he had then got above the warming influence of
  condensation of steam.        The effect of condensation in raising
  temperature, is seen also in the method practised of heating
   water by passing steam into            it.    found that one pound
                                                   It

142   Mr. T. Hopkins             on the Formation                   of the Cumulus Cloud.
densation of steam taking place in the atmosphere there will
be an upward atmospheric movement, which will cause fresh
condensation and further upward movement, and this process
may form the cumulus cloud, which may rise to a less or greater
height in the atmosphere, and the cloud may be dissipated or
may give out rain according to the quantity of steam contained
in the atmosphere, and the condensing power of cold.
   The atmospheric movements which have been here consi
dered, are represented by Mr. Espy as originating with, and
caused by, the direct heating power of the sun, but the action
of the sun may be only one of the causes which produce the
phaenomena.        Any cause which shall have the effect of ele
vating a column of the atmosphere sufficiently to cause con
densation of steam to begin, may commence the process de
scribed, and cause cumuli to form.              A current of air having
nearly a maximum quantity of steam for the temperature, be
ing forced by the inertia of the mass against a ridge of hills,
the lower part must rise, and in rising must force up the whole
of the column that rests upon                 This forcing

face  of the earth, had been the prime mover.                 this way the     In

the south-west, until the process                         of
                                               condensation commences
and clouds are formed.            And the    long  lines     cumuli flow       of

 Westmoreland,            eastward towards Yorkshire, when they

Challis will find, on examination, that        I have used all which
  were required.
     But Professor Challis states that these six equations “are
 exactly verified by the kind of motion which Mr. Airy con
 siders to be impossible ’’ (page 64, line 29), and then proceeds
  to show (page 66) that Poisson's law of motion satisfies these
 equations.      What particular obscurity in my expressions, or
 what omission of my explanatory words in Professor Challis's
 reading of them, can have led to such a misinterpretation of
 my meaning as this sentence implies, I cannot imagine.             My
 words (page 322, line 15) were,       “If, in order to support Pro
 <U+017F>essor Challis's expression for the movement of the particles
 to or from a centre, we suppose, &c. &c.” I did not object
 to Poisson's expression, or to any other involving cos 0 as a
 multiplier; but                 I
                        remarked (page 328, line 17) that “the
 onus of  proving   that the three equations are consistent rests
 with the   supporter,   &c.”; in other words, that the possibility
 is not to be assumed without proof, and that each case must
 rest on    its
              own proof.      That     did not intend        object
                                                                 I                          to              to

nient at first for the examination of Professor Challis's ex

given by Professor Challis,                              I

tions are obtained ; that these fundamental equations are the
four given by Professor Challis at the bottom of page 64;
that they are established on consideration of the complete
and absolute change in the state of pressure, density, and
velocity, of the particles of the fluid, in proceeding from a
point where the coordinates have one value to another point
where they have a different value; and that it is absolutely
impossible that there can be, in forming them, any limitation
as to the functions whose change is or is not to be taken
into account. I am quite certain that the new doctrine of
omitting certain functions in the differentiation cannot stand
a moment, when examined with reference to the original un
derstanding on which the first equations have been obtained.
   Perhaps the error of this principle may be made more ob
vious by considering a simpler case. Suppose we consider the
motion of parallel plane waves through air. It is well known
that the disturbance of a particle in the direction of r may
be expressed by X = cosa. 4 (v t—a cos 2–y cos 3–2 cos y).
Suppose that there is a wall in the air, whose equation is
a = 0.     The value of                X
                              must therefore vanish when a = 0.
But it does not vanish then. What must be done to make it
vanish 2. A follower of Professor Challis would say,                                           “Mul
tiply it by a function which will vanish when z = 0, as for
instance a r, and omit the variation of this factor in all differ
entiations.”    (This mode of escaping from the difficulty is

XXV.     On the Phaenomena of Diffraction in the Centre of the
  Shadow of a Circular Disc, placed before a luminous Point,
  as erhibited by Experiment.  By Richard Potten, Esq.,
   M.A.”
      HE  results of the undulatory theory, to which I called
     attention in the Number of the Magazine for October
lastt, being opposed to the received opinions upon those points,
it became desirable to undertake an experimental examination
of the most decisive case; namely, the nature of the phae
nomena in the centre of the shadow of a circular disc when
placed directly before a luminous point.         According to that
theory the point in the centre of the shadow ought to be as
bright as if the disc were not interposed; and this being ac
                         byas all
knowledged on         sides, we have                   an
                                           admitted and clear test
*
   the theory,       long                              theory which
                                                                      be

         be
         tested     experiment.
   The labour which the Astronomer Royal has devoted                                                to
deducing the numerical magnitudes, given            his paper     the in                      in
January Numbert, has also rendered this experiment more
interesting, and      may anticipate the result
                         I                             which     have      at             I
arrived,        by
              stating that the undulatory theory          this,              in                as   in
 so many other cases, fails entirely.
    Before relating the experiments,           must notice some

and the relative brightness which renders neighbouring spaces
which are differently illuminated distinguishable from each
other      by
           the eye; because                   an
                                  incorrect assumption          these                     on

yet they are easily seen by such an eye-lens as in common ex
perience we use in examining phaenomena of diffraction:
be it remembered these satellites are also bodies reflecting a
very feeble light.      Further, Mr. Airy says, a spot whose dia
meter is 0-0037    inch,  or about sºn inch, is “a speck difficult
even for a philosopher to discover under these circumstances.”
Now sºn inch is the breadth of an ordinary hair of the hu
man head, and these are to be seen of a perceptible breadth,
even as opake bodies surrounded by opake bodies: would not
a philosopher both see, and expect to see, bright spots when
surrounded by darkness, even if they were in diameter only
a very small fraction of this magnitude?
    To proceed to the immediate subject of the paper: made                     I
preparation for trying the experiment several months ago,
but when the apparatus was completed it was some time be
fore a clear sunshine occurred to suit the aspect of the win
dow of my darkened room, at a time when I could command
leisure to pursue the experiments.
   I   prepared, by turning and polishing very carefully in a
lathe, discs of brass of Tº <U+017F>º, <U+017F>º, 1%, and <U+017F>o inch in dia
meter, and with watch-makers' implements one of gº inch
diameter. The luminous point was the sun's image formed
by a lens of # inch focal length, and therefore it was of con
siderably less diameter than ºn inch.              The discs were at
tached    by thin films of cement to a        plate of glass with flat
 and   parallel surfaces,  which had never been before used, and
 they were so formed that the diffracting circular edge was
 raised from the glass; in some of them this edge was formed
 by the junction of the side and base of the frustum of a very
 obtuse-angled cone, and in others the edge was formed by
 the junction of two such frustums.           The base               by
                                                             which they

 ter than the diffracting edge,         so
                                         that the cement which oozed
 out round the édge          ofthis base, was far out        the way of                  of
 the light concerned        inthe phaenomena                of
                                                     diffraction.    The

  which the phaenomena            of
                                   diffraction were examined, was
  60  inches distance      on
                            the other side. The plate            glass    of
  which the discs were       cemented,    was rendered    perpendicular
 to  the incident light     by
                            adjusting until the reflected light passed
  directly back again.       I generally used the apparatus          that          so

154             Mr. Potter   on the Phaenomena          of Diffraction
versed, or the disc between the plate and the luminous point.
It was also found, on trial, that the appearances were not
sensibly changed if the focus of the eye-lens were rather more
or rather less than 60 inches from the disc.
   When the whole was adjusted, on looking through an eye
lens of about 1 inch focal length, at the centre of the shadow
cast by a disc, there was seen a bright central spot, of a
white colour slightly tinged with brown, surrounded by a
greater or less number of coloured rings, according to the
size of the disc. The central bright spot in the shadow of
the disc of gº inch diameter was large, and so bright, that at
the first view it would have been taken to be equally bright
with the light which had passed uninterruptedly, further from
the edge of the disc than any interference was visible.       But
experience in photometrical experiments immediately pointed
out to me the allowance to be made for the heightening effect
of contrast, the bright spot being surrounded by a dark ring.
It was evidently necessary to place the portions of light,
which were to be compared, in the same circumstances.          To
effect this, I perforated a plate of thin sheet brass with the
point of a needle, making a number of small circular holes
of different sizes and at different distances, so that they could
be taken in pairs of equal size.    Now placing this brass plate
in the focus of the    eye-lens, where it was moveable and ca
pable of adjustment, and causing one of these holes to trans
mit the central part of the central bright spot, and then com
paring it with the light passing through an equal hole at a
distance beyond any visible interference, it was seen at once
that the brightness of the centre of the central bright spot in
the shadow was very much less intense than that of the light
passing through the other hole.      In the shadow of the larger
discs the inferiority of the brightness of the central spot was
evident at once without any precautions, and the intensity
appeared to diminish rapidly with the increase of diameter of
the disc.     The capability of the undulatory theory to explain
º
the phaenomena     is thus completely set at rest; for, according
                                                                                  of be

                            in   the Shadow          of a Circular Disc.                                155
was used.              From the result of many trials         concluded that       I
four plates produced the most accurate correspondence.                     To
find how much          light  these mica    plates   transmitted,    I looked
through a rhomb of Iceland spar, at a strip of white paper so
broad that the two images overlapped, and of course at such
overlapping the intensity was the double of what it was on
 either side of             it:
                            similar effect was produced
                                 a                                 somewhere            by

                                      the mica plates.         estimated that      I
     was nearer two than three plates which were required; but
to it   ascientific friend, with whom, on another occasion,                  re                    I
 peated      it,   appeared                to   be
                                         nearer three than two that were
 requisite,        so it
                    that      shall consider

 transmitting only one half               the light: and four such plates
                                                   of
 would therefore transmit one-third part very nearly. This
 shows how widely the fact was                     variance with the result

   The young gentleman who is the subject of this memoir had been
affected from birth with strabismus of both eyes; the right eye was
amaurotic, and the left deprived of sight by the opacity both of the

 first time,  on the third day after the operation, the patient described

when the eye was         at rest remained stationary, and their margins
partially covering one another. Two days after this the same phe
nomena were observed, but the spheres were less opake and some

peared   to  cover each other more than before.           He was now for the
first time capable,   as   he said,     looking through these spheres, and

side       the plane
          of                 disappearance, and the complementary system
                                    of
on   the other side.                 In
                               this experiment the polarization             the light                  of

            of Polarized Light,    and on a Polarimeter.                 1.59
in one plane was compensated by the polarization of the same light
in the opposite plane; and, consequently, both the pencils, which
had undergone the two successive polarizing actions, had received
the same degree of polarization in opposite planes; and in virtue of
these two equal and opposite polarizations, the light at the point of
compensation, where the system of rings disappeared, had been re
stored from partially polarized to common light; and the light on
each side of this point of compensation was in opposite states of
partial polarization.
    In order to give a distinct view of the nature of this experiment,
the author details the phenomena observed at particular angles of
incidence on glass.    From the results at an angle of incidence of
24°, the ray suffering one refraction at 80°, and a second reflexion
at 83%", he concludes that the compensation which takes place is
produced neither by an equality of oppositely polarized rays, nor by
a proportional admixture of common light, but by equal and oppo
 site physical states of the whole pencil, whether reflected or re
fracted.
    The remarkable phenomena produced at an angle of incidence on
glass of 82° 44' (at which angle cos (i + i) = cos” (i + i)), led the
author to the construction of what he terms the compensating rhomb,
consisting of a well-annealed rhomb of glass, or any other uncry
stallized substance, having the angles of its base 130°25' and 46° 35'
respectively, when the index of refraction is 1:525. When a ray of
light is incident upon the first surface at an angle of 82° 44', ex
actly one-half of it is reflected ; and the other half, after refraction,
is reflected at the second surface, and emerges perpendicularly to
the adjacent surface, without suffering refraction; each portion
having, in the first instance, the same quantity of polarized light.
The second portion is found, on examination, to be in the state of
common light, although the ray at the second incidence consisted of
more than one-half of polarized light.          Hence if the pencil, pre
viously to reflexion at the second surface, consist of 145 rays of
polarized light, and 188 of common light, the effect of a single re
flexion must be to depolarize polarized light, and to produce no
change whatever upon common light; a property of a reflecting
surface never yet recognized, and incompatible with           all
                                                                our present
knowledge     on the subject of  the polarization  of light.
   The author then describes an instrument which he has invented
for the purpose    ofaccurately measuring the degrees        ofpolarization,
and which he therefore terms        a   Polarimeter.    It consists of   two
parts; one   of  which  is  intended   to produce  a  ray     compensation
                                                             of
having  a   physical character susceptible  of  numerical expression, and
the other    to  produce   polarized   bands, or  rectilineal isochromatic
lines, the extinction   of   which indicates that the compensation         is
effected.    The construction and mode       of  operation    ofthis instru
ment    are, by the aid of  figures, described and explained.
   The following   is  the general law established      bythese researches;
namely, that the compensations         ofpolarized light are produced      by
equal and opposite rotations      of  the planes   ofpolarization.    Thus,

various periods of their development, the results of which he details.
 He arrives at the conclusion that this tissue is composed of carti
 laginous corpuscles and of fibres; the latter preponderating in adult
 life, the former in infancy; and that during life the corpuscles are
 gradually converted into fibres.            He enters at length into the ques
 tion of the    vascularity   of these    cartilages;   and from a careful study
 of   many   injected   specimens     of man and animals at various periods
of their    development,       the   particular     results of which he relates,
he believes that blood-vessels are contained only in their fibrous
portion, and have the function of nourishing that which is cartila
ginous, and which, on account of its being subject to compression
and concussion, does not contain any.
    Among the second class of extra-vascular tissues, the cornea is
 first treated of; and its structure is described as being very lax, and
 as containing corpuscles only in a small quantity. The opinions in
 favour of     its vascularity are combated; and                    shown that the

         Mr. Ferrall                 on certain Structures            in the Orbit.                     163
of plants.   The author describes each of the tissues of this class at
length, and shows that the various modifications presented by the
vascular system with which each is in contact, have the sole object
of enabling a large quantity of blood to approach and circulate
slowly around them.      He also points out, in connexion with this
subject, the remarkable vital properties which are possessed by these
non-vascular tissues.
   In concluding this paper, the author states that his object has been
to establish as a law in animal physiology, that tissues are capable
of being nourished, and of increasing in size, without the presence
of blood-vessels within their substance. He shows the analogy
which is presented between the extra-vascular animal and the extra
vascular vegetable tissues.  He expresses a hope that the application
to surgery of the above law, with reference to the prolongation of
blood-vessels into the extra-vascular tissues during disease, and to
pathology in the investigation of the nature of morbid structures,
particularly of those classes which contain no blood-vessels, will be
not devoid of interest, and will be productive of some advantage.
   The Society then adjourned over the Whitsun recess, to meet
again on the 10th of June.
  June 10.—The following     papers were read, viz.—
   1. “Magnetic-term Observations made at Milan, on the 21st and
22nd of April, 1841.”     Communicated by Professor Carlini, For.
Memb. R.S.
   2. “Register of Tidal Observations made at Prince of Wales's
Island, in July, August and September, 1840.”
   3. “Register of Tidal Observations made at Singapore in July,
August and September, 1840.”
   These two papers were presented by the Directors of the East
India Company, and communicated by P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.

Orbit, not previously described.” By J. M. Ferrall, Esq., M.R.I.A.
Communicated by Sir Benjamin C. Brodie, Bart., F.R.S.
   The author describes a distinct fibrous tunic, which he terms the
tunica vaginalis oculi, continuous with the tarsal cartilages and
ligaments in front, and extending backwards to the bottom, or apex
of the orbit; thus completely insulating the globe of the eye, and
keeping it apart from the muscles which move             The eye-ball      it.                           is

   5. “An account of some recent improvements in Photography.”
By H. F. Talbot, Esq. F.R.S.
   The author had originally intended, in giving an account of his
recent experiments in photography, to have entered into numerous
details with respect to the phaenomena observed; but finding that
to follow out this plan would occupy a considerable time, he has
thought that it would be best to put the Society, in the first place,
in possession of the principal facts, and by so doing perhaps invite
new observers into the field during the present favourable season for
making experiments.       He has, therefore, confined himself at present
to a  description  of the improved photographic method, to which he
has  given  the name of Calotype”, and reserves for another occasion

shall call this mixture the gallo-nitrate of silver.
   Then take a sheet of iodized paper and wash it over with this gallo
nitrate of silver, with a soft brush, taking care to wash it on the side
which has been previously marked. This operation should be per
formed by candlelight.        Let the paper rest half a minute, and then
dip it into water. Then dry it lightly with blotting-paper, and
finally dry it cautiously at a fire, holding it at a considerable distance
therefrom.     When dry, the paper is           for use.    The author hasfit

fifteen inches, the author finds that one minute is amply sufficient in
summer to impress a strong image upon the paper of any building
upon which the sun is shining. When the aperture amounts to
one-third of the focal length, and the object is very white, as a
plaster bust, &c., it appears to him that one second is sufficient to
obtain a pretty good image of                               it.
    The images thus received upon the Calotype paper are for the
most part invisible impressions.     They may      made visible by the                 be

 lour, I take it out, and pass it for about two seconds over the open
  ing of a bottle containing chloride of iodine; and immediately I put
 it again in the iodine box, where it acquires very soon the yellow
  colour, which shows that the plate is ready to be placed into the
 camera obscura.          I have substituted to the chloride of iodine,
  chloride of bromine, and have found nearly the same result; but I
 prefer chloride of iodine as producing a better effect; and besides,
  on account of the noxious smell of bromine.

 seconds.”

     Dec. 16,  1840.-A       paper   “On   the Relative Connection of the
 Eastern and Western Chalk Denudations,”                by P. J. Martin, Esq.,
 F.G.S.,    was read.
     The author advances this as the first of a series of papers on the
 construction of that part of the country usually considered as
 appertaining to the great chalk denudation of the Weald, or more
 properly, the upburst of the secondary formations between the
 tertiary of the respective basins of London and Hampshire.
     In venturing on this field of inquiry, he professes also to take up
 the subject where it was left by him in two former memoirs, one
 published in 1828 under the title of a ‘Geological Memoir of Western
 Sussex, with some Observations on Chalk Basins and the Weald
 Denudation*, the other in the “Philosophical Magazine’ for Fe
 bruary 1829t; and to extend the number of demonstrative facts that
 bear upon the theory of denudation by disruptive violence and con
 temporaneous aqueous abrasion, there brought forward as a corollary
 to Dr. Buckland's theory of ‘Valleys of Elevation.’
     In pursuance of this object, he begins by an examination into the
 arrangement of the great chalk dome of Hampshire and Wiltshire,
 the Patria of the chalk of Pennant and Conybeare; its anticlinal
 lines of disturbance or upheaval, and their connections with those
 of the Weald and the smaller western denudations of Pewsey, War
 dour and Warminster.
     He finds that six great anticlinal lines are the main instruments
 of the upbearing of this abraded chalk; that the three which
 characterize the smaller anticlinal western valleys are projected
 onward, and in a manner decussate three others which emanate
 from the western extremity of the greater valley of the Weald, the
 vale of Wolmar Forest, from whence he starts his inquiry; and that
 these lines do not inosculate or enter into each other; approxima

ting, indeed, but little in any part of their course; severally dying
out, and their respective synclinal lines playing off into each other.
Their course is rather irregular, and their force exceedingly varia
ble; but their general parallelism is maintained throughout, their
progress being E. and W., with a point to the N.
   The Pewsey line, after passing through the valleys of Ham and
Kingsclere, is traceable between Woolverton and Hannington, on
towards Monks Sherborne, and fades away at Old Basing, apparently
without entering the tertiary beds of the London basin *. This
meets in synclinal relation with a line projected from the north
west corner of the Wolmar valley from Pease Marsh, near Guildford,
through Farnham and the high chalk range of Froyle, Shaldon,
Dummer and Popham, and appears to fade away in the country
west of Andover, where it is lost in the greater swell of the Burgh
clere Hills, and the more dominant power of the Pewsey upheaval.
   The anticlinal line of Wardour, left by Dr. Fitton (in his ‘History
of the Beds below the Chalk’t) at Harnham Hill, S. of Salisbury,
Mr. Martin finds traceable eastward, north of Dean Hill, and east of
the Avon, to the banks of the Test, where it dips under the tertiary
beds between Michaelmarsh and Romsey, and appears to fade away
between the above-mentioned river and the Itching.              In synclinal
relation this line is also met and     passed  by  a very  remarkable anti
clinal, traceable in strict approximation with, and by-and-by to be
proved to be the prorimate cause of, the whole line of the South
Down escarpment (with a small exception between Lewes and Poy
nings) from Beachy Head to East Meon. In the vicinity of this place,
 at Langrish, it enters the chalk, passes through the anticlinal valley
 of Chilcomb near Winchester and that city, and is lost in the Bos
 sington Hills, pointing towards, but not satisfactorily traced into,
 the Warminster line.
    The details of all three lines of elevation are made out in the
 Ordnance Map, and sections given of the most illustrative points:
 and Mr. Martin adds some observations respecting the entrance of
 the great central line of elevation of the Weald into the chalk at
 Selborne, and         its
                       progress westward between the lines             Pease        of
marsh on the north, and                 of

the other volcanic products, and in dykes which intersect all the
igneous rocks. . It is occasionally amorphous, but more often rudely
columnar; it also, though rarely, presents regular columns; and
it is sometimes schistose, possessing planes of cleavage as well as of
regular stratification.
    The scoriaceous basalt is rough and porous, resembling the slag
of a foundry.       Where the bed is thin it is scoriaceous throughout,
but where it is of a certain thickness only the upper and lower sur
faces exhibit this character.       Two caverns of considerable magni
 tude occur immediately to the west of the principal landing-place
at Funchal, and there are others in the island.
    The vesicular lava or basalt presents through its whole mass a
 porous texture.      The large vesicles have been flattened by the gra
 vity of the lava, and elongated in the direction in which the coulée
flowed.      Where they are numerous and minute, they permit the
rock to be easily hewn ; and this variety is called cantaria rija, or
 the hard building stone.
    The lapilli, sand, ashes and volcanic bombs, appear to have been
 projected simultaneously, as the bombs were evidently half imbedded
 in the finer materials by the force of their fall, the laminae beneath
 them being bent upwards, and in some instances to a greater height
 on one side than the other, indicating the direction in which the
 bombs fell.
     The pumiceous lapilli are white or light yellow, and rarely ex
 ceed in size a pigeon's egg.      Beds of pumice, varying in thickness
 from a few inches to several feet, occur either on the surface or   in
 terstratified with the basalt and tufa ; and they often contain por
 tions of heavier volcanic products, as cinders or scoriae, dispersed
 without regard to gravitation, proving, Mr. Smith says, that these
 various materials could not have been deposited under the sea, be
 cause in water they would instantly have separated according to
 their respective weights. The scoriae or cinders also form extensive
 beds.    They are generally reddish, and vary in size according to
 the distance from the orifice of eruption.
     The ashes, both dark and light-coloured, are incoherent, except
 where they are mixed with earthy matter, or apparently fell on a
 heated cone of eruption; and in these cases they form a scoriaceous
 mass.    Tufas and conglomerates compose a large proportion of the
 volcanic rocks of Madeira, and are considered to owe their consist
 ency to water.     Fragments of vegetables are not uncommon in them,
 but Mr. Smith is not aware that they contain any other organic
  remains.     Many of these beds have been converted into vegetable
 soils, and it is interesting, the author says, to observe the roots of
  plants still in the attitude in which they grew; and to witness traces
  of the very same phaenomena which are now taking place at the sur
  face, in strata which have been buried for so many ages under solid
  rocks. The remains of plants are chiefly found in the vegetable
  soils, but their roots occasionally occur in the hard rock, and the
  cracks or fissures are in many cases filled with closely-matted masses
  of what was once roots and fibres, but now consist of carbonate of

 lime.    Where the soils have been overflowed with lava, the vege
 table remains are charred, and the soils have been burnt to the co
 lour and hardness of brick; and if the overlying lava is of great
 thickness, a columnar structure appears. This conversion of soil
 into brick has been observed in the Azores and elsewhere.
    The principal chain of mountains must at one time, Mr. Smith
 states, have been much higher, because their very summits consist of
 beds which are met with only at the base of active volcanic cones.
 There is consequently no great crater in the island, but there are
 the ruins of several truncated craters, and many small lateral cones.
 The most extensive of the former is the Curral dos Freiras, an im
 mense ravine about three miles in length, one in breadth, and 2000
 feet in depth, and open on its southern side. The beds of basalt,
 tufa and ashes of which it is composed, dip outwards to the base of
 the mountain, and parallel to its surface. Mr. Smith is convinced,
 the volcanic products of the island being subaérial, that this is not
 a crater of elevation, though it agrees with the characters which
 have been assigned to such craters; and he is further induced to
 infer, from the resemblance of the Curral dos Freiras to the more
ancient portions of Teneriffe and the other Canary Islands, said to
 be craters of elevation raised from beneath the level of the sea, that
 a wrong conclusion has been drawn respecting them.            He does not
 object to there being elsewhere true craters of elevation.
    The principal lateral cones are to the west of Funchal, but they
are in general so completely blotted with vegetation that their struc
ture is concealed. In the ditch of a fort constructed on one of them,
called Pico de St. João, a scoriaceous conglomerate intersected by
minute basaltic veins is exposed; and a similar conglomerate occurs
in the fortified island in Funchal Bay, also at the eminence at the
landing-place.      Some of these cones are covered by beds of lava
 and tufa  erupted   from craters at Cape Giram, in one instance to the
 thickness of 1400 feet. The beauty and regularity, within limited
 distances, of these volcanic strata, and the richness and variety of
 their colouring, are exceedingly striking. The most remarkable vol
 canic series, amounting to many hundred beds, is at Cape Giram, the
 cliff, 1600 feet in height, being stratified from the base to the summit.
 It has been rent in many places, and the fissures which terminate up
wards in acute angles, have been filled with lava ejected from below.

    The limestone of San Vincente, Bowditch considered to be trans
ition, but Mr. Smith shows that it belongs to the tertiary epoch,
yet he believes it to be the fundamental rock of the island.            It
crosses a mountain stream between 2000 and 3000 feet above the
level of the sea, and abounds in zoophytes and marine testacea be
longing to the genera Cardium, Pecten, Pectunculus, Spondylus, Cy
praea, Voluta, Fasciolaria, Strombus and Murea.        The state of preser
vation, generally in that of casts, rendered it impossible to determine
accurately the species.      The limestone is traversed by two dykes of
basalt, and it lies immediately under the Paul de Serra, a volcanic
plateau which rises 2500 feet above the limestone.

    The occurrence of the marine limestone of San Vincente at an
elevation of 2500 feet, proves a relative change in level of land and
sea to that amount, previously, Mr. Smith is of opinion, to the ejec
tion of the overlying volcanic products; but he has not observed in
Madeira any proofs of elevation of the land during or subsequent
to the volcanic period; though there are strong indications of sub
 sidence, the beds of scoriae and ashes, and those containing vege
table remains, dipping under the sea, and occurring in situations
where they could not have remained, had the sea level been always
the same as at present.
    A letter, dated Madras, July 1840, addressed to John Taylor,
 Esq., Treas. G.S., by Mr. Frederick Burr, on the Geology of Aden,
 on the coast of Arabia, was afterwards read.
    The promontory of Aden, eighty miles eastward of the Straits of
 Bab-el-mandeb, consists of a bold cluster of volcanic rocks with
lofty jagged peaks, and is connected with the main land by a low
isthmus.     Its extreme length is about six miles, and its breadth is
about three miles, and the summit of the highest point is about
 1776 feet above the level of the sea. The loftier portions of the
promontory are wholly volcanic, and the lower are partly volcanic
and partly consolidated sea-sand.        The most interesting portion of
the district is an immense, nearly circular crater, situated at the ex
tremity of the promontory next the main land, and in the centre of
which, upon a flat little raised above the sea-level, stands the town
of Aden. The diameter of the crater is about one and a half mile,
and it is surrounded on              all
                                 sides but the eastern with precipices
chiefly composed      lava, and rising from 1000
                      of                             1776 feet     height.
                                                                       to             in
Although the crater appears         first sight almost perfect, Mr. Burr
                                           at
says, it  has been affected by some rude shocks which have cleft                                it

are harder and more compact than the beds they traverse. Small

XXVII.       On the Form and Optical Constants                                         of Anhydrite.
    By W. H.   Millen, M.A., F.R.S., Professor                                         of Mineralogy
    in the University of Cambridge*.
THE   following values of the angles between normals to the
  faces of anhydrite were obtained from the measurements
of a single crystal,—the only one exhibiting any forms, ex
cept those of cleavage, which I have been able to procure.
The faces being extremely dull, the only signal that could be
used in observing with the reflective goniometer was a small
opening in a screen, through which sun-light was thrown by
reflexion from a plane mirror.        The results obtained under
such circumstances cannot be very accurate; they are, how
ever, certainly much nearer the truth than those which Haüy
has given, and which appear to have been adopted by          suc                              all
ceeding mineralogical writers.

in  combining  with water 510:1 units of heat, and since acid of
6 HO + SOs would still evolve with water 38.9, the total
quantity of heat which would have been evolved by the mix

510: 1    –38.9 + 597.9 = 1069. 1.
    The second series of experiments was executed with pot
ash, and gave the following results.      M. Hess was obliged,
however, to modify the mode of working.          In consequence
of   potash  combining  with water in various   proportions,  and
evolving thereby different quantities of heat, it was necessary
to use the solution of potash so weak as not to be affected by
any further addition of water; and the mass of materials be
came then so large as to preclude the use of the calorimeter,
which had hitherto served so well. The method of mixtures
was therefore adopted. The vessel in which the mixture was
 effected was nearly globular in form, and about a litre in
capacity; it weighed 290 grammes, equivalent to fifty-five
              ".
grammes of water. The water was first introduced, and then
so much solution of potash as was necessary for neutralizing a
 certain          of acid. The temperature of the liquid was
 observed immediately on the addition of the potash, and the
 rise of temperature on the addition of the acid.        All these
 fluids were measured, and when the temperature had fallen to
 the standard, the specific gravity was taken which gave the
 weight.    The specific heat of the solution was found to be
0-943.

  M. Hess    remarks that, as these numbers are sensibly the
same as those obtained for potash, the rise of temperature,
which occurs when NaO + SO, is mixed with 10 HO, does
not take place when the solutions are mixed together; and
hence infers, that the Na O is already combined with at least
10 Aq.
  F.   carrying on the experiments with lime, some additional
circumstances required to be observed. The lime was weighed
dry, and then put into a bottle with 700 grammes of water,
when it slaked and evolved heat.     After having waited until
the temperature had fallen to that of the surrounding air, the
acid was added.     In this, as in   other experiments     this  all                                            of

be asked how lime differs so much from the other bases, which
give about 600. This may depend upon two things; first, that
the two atoms of water, which gypsum contains, evolve heat,
or else it could not be a chemical combination; or, secondly,
that it may arise from the solidification of the sulphuric acid.
In order to obtain some indications on this point, M. Hess
made two experiments on the quantity of heat evolved by
gypsum in setting, and found that for SOs there are evolved
36-5 to 377 units of heat.
     If
      we subtract that from the 642-5, we have 604’8 for the
                                     1076-1 with anhydrous sul

heat evolved with        vitriol,of                  or
phuric acid.
   M. Hess also ascertained that dry lime,       combining with       in
water, evolves 1672 units      heat.           of
                     Experiments with Muriatic Acid.

50-84 units of heat for one atom of muriatic acid.       In calcu

  In connexion with the subject of this abstract we have to
notice a paper by Dr. Andrews of Belfast, ‘On the Heat de
veloped during the Combination of Acids and Bases,” read be
fore the Royal  Irish Academy, January 11, 1841*.
  The general conclusions at which the author arrives are
contained in the two following laws:—
  Law 1. The heat developed during the union of acids
and bases is determined by the base, and not by the acid; the
same base       producing,  when combined with an equivalent of
different acids, nearly the same quantity         of heat, but different
bases a different quantity.
    Law 2. When a neutral is converted into an acid salt, no
change of temperature occurs.
    In the commencement of the paper a preliminary experi
ment is described, the object of which is to determine the ex
act quantity of heat evolved during the combination of nitric
acid and potash. The solutions, both acid and alkaline, were
 taken so weak in this and                          all
                                        the other experiments detailed
in   the communication, that subsequent dilution with water did
not produce any change            temperature. On neutralizing the

following new and easy method:—Twenty-eight parts of per
<U+017F>ectly dried ferrocyanate of potash are mixed with fourteen
parts of the black oxide of manganese, both finely powdered,
the mixture heated on a smooth iron plate, (not in a crucible)
over a coal fire, to incipient redness, stirring frequently. The
mass on cooling is washed out with cold water, and the liquid
mixed with twenty and a half parts of dry sulphate of animo
nia. It is advantageous to place aside the first strong ley ob
tained, and to dissolve the sulphate of ammonia at the com.
mon temperature in the last water, and to add this to the first
concentrated solution.      Usually a strong precipitate of sul
phate of potash is immediately formed, from which the liquid
is separated by decantation; it is then evaporated in the water
bath or on some warm place, boiling being avoided, and the
liquid poured off, as long as it is possible, from the deposit of
sulphate of potash.       It is then evaporated to dryness and
treated with boiling alcohol of 80-90 per cent, which dissolves
the urea, while the sulphate salts remain undissolved. In this
 manner nearly four ounces of perfectly colourless and beauti
fully crystallized urea may be obtained from a pound of the
 ferrocyanate of potash.     It frequently happens that the solu
 tion  containing  the  sulphate  of potash and urea is coloured
 yellow by ferrocyanide of ammonium, or of potassium, which
 dissolves in the alcohol, and gives to the crystals of urea a yel
 lowish colour; it may easily be separated by the addition of
                                                       º
 a solution of copperas, after separation of the Prussian blue
 carbonate of ammonia is added to the liquid, which decom
 poses the excess of iron salt, and the         becomes clear and
 colourless, and may then be evaporated and treated as above.

Ba Q + 2 aq.    It is isomeric with Delalande's camphen
sulphate, &c.—(Annales de Chim, et de Phys. III. t. i. p. 60.)
   On account of the great length of this memoir, many im
perfectly examined, and not as yet analysed substances, have
been passed over in this abstract without notice.     Liebig's
remarks, moreover, showing that the French type is nothing
more than radical, could not be extracted without encroach
ing too much on other important papers.
             On the Action       of Potassa    on Indigo-blue.
  Fritzsché has continued his researches           on Anilin, a sub
stance which had been previously described by Unverdorben
under the name of Crystallin, as has been already mentioned.
(Notices, Phil. Mag., s. 3, vol. xviii. p. 280.) The action does not
commence until the potassa solution is very concentrated and
has been boiled some time; the boiling point must be as high
as 150°. If the solution be kept at this temperature, and pure
indigo-blue added from time to time, the whole is dissolved,
forming a yellowish red liquid, in which, after a time, crystals
are formed; it is then better to stop the operation and allow
the whole to crystallize.      By this operation hardly a trace of
any volatile substance is formed, and no gas evolved. A
small quantity of a dark-coloured substance is formed with
the yellow potash salt, from which it cannot be separated; it
appears to be an accidental product.            If
                                                the whole crystallized
 mass be treated with      water,   this dark coloured substance
 causes a formation of indigo-blue, but the excess of potassa
also acts on the yellow salt, and indigo-blue is precipitated.
It is better therefore to saturate the greater part of the potassa
in the solution with an acid. A bluish green precipitate is
formed, and by filtering a golden-yellow fluid is obtained, out
of which acids precipitate a voluminous flocky reddish-brown
body—chrysanilic acid. The colour of this new acid is simi
lar to that of kermes mineral.        It is not at       all
                                                        crystalline, as

 for then the fluid becomes     green.     The metallic salts are             in
 soluble, lead and zinc salts are      of  beautiful red colour. The

 formula     not
            is    as yet determined; the results obtained            not do
 agree well with one another.        By dissolving chrysanilic acid
in  dilute sulphuric acid two new bodies are formed, one                      of
 which crystallizes out      on
                              cooling, the other remains dissolved.

 It  may be prepared in another way. The crystalline mass
 obtained by acting on indigo-blue with potassa is dissolved in

the protochloride.      Formula C* H19 Nº     §.  O”, i.e. bichlo

   Bibromisatyd is very similar, Clº Ho Nº Brº O'.
   Chlorisatyd heated to 180° gives off water, in greater quan
tity at 200°; the remainder in the retort is of a brownish-violet
colour. Chloride of isatin sublimes in crystals, and the remain
ing mass evidently contains more of the same, which, as well as
the undecomposed chlorisatyd, may be extracted by boiling al
cohol. The insoluble part is pulverulent, dirty violet-coloured,
insoluble in water, alcohol and hydrochloric acid; soluble in
caustic potash solution with yellow colour. The alkaline solu
tion gives with hydrochloric acid a yellow precipitate, soluble
in boiling water. The violet body is chloride of indin. The
composition does not appear to be yet accurately determined.
Bichloride of indin is obtained in the same manner, and is
quite similar; bichlorisatyd, as well as bibromisatyd, are de
composed, however, at a lower temperature than the proto
chloride (chlorisatyd).     Bibromide of indin is of a deep black
ish red  colour,  somewhat soluble in alcohol.      Chlorisatyd is
easily soluble in a solution of caustic potash; out of the solu
tion a salt crystallizes, which is chlorisatinate of potassa; out
of the mother liquor acetic acid precipitates a yellow body,
soluble in boiling water; by boiling the solution (which has
been filtered from the yellow matter so obtained) with hydro
chloric acid, flocks of a brownish violet substance are precipi
tated, precisely similar to the above-mentioned chloride of
indin. In the fluid is chloride of isatin. Bichlorisatyd be
haves exactly similar, only that the salt which first crystallizes
out is not bichlorisatinate of potassa.    Its solution gives with
hydrochloric acid a yellowish white precipitate, soluble in hot
water, from which it is deposited by cooling.             Formula,

    (20.) I do not at present know what is the reason of this
 result, but the analogy between it and the arrangement of
 mercurial globules, which cover the surface of a Daguerreo
 type, is too striking to be overlooked.         It proves to us that
surfaces may assume such a condition as to affect the deposi
tion of vapours upon them, so as to give rise to the repro
duction of appearances of external forms.             I gave therefore
particular attention to this point, but eventually found that
silver exists in an ordinary Daguerreotype, in connexion with
                           in all
the mercury         over the plate,          less proportion   in  the

 cently formed.      In the course of time, however, a great por

 the lights, evaporates away.            When the picture has thus

     (4.1.)Upon an iodized plate I received a solar spectrum
 formed by a flint-glass prism, the ray being kept motionless
 by reflexion from a heliostat, and the plate so arranged as to
 receive the refracted rays perpendicularly.   After five minutes
 it was mercurialized, and the resulting proof exhibited the
 place of the more refrangible colours in the most brilliant
 hues.   The lesser refrangible colours had also left their im
 press of a whitish aspect, but the region of the yellow was
 unaltered.   All the different rays, therefore, except the yel
low, have the power of changing this particular preparation.
 Now, when a number of pieces of cloth of different colours
are placed in the sun-beam, they absorb heat in proportion
as their colour is deeper.    A black cloth, which does not re
flect any of those calorific rays, becomes presently hot; and
in the same way Daguerre's sensitive preparation absorbs                                                           all

-   When we look          at   aDaguerreotype,       we are struck with the
remarkable gradation                 of
                                     tint, and we naturally infer that

or increased brilliancy of the light, until a certain point is
gained, and now the iodide of silver apparently undergoes
no further visible change; but another point being gained, it
begins to assume, when mercurialized, a pale blue tint, be
coming deeper and deeper, until it at last assumes the                                                             bril
liant blue of a watch-spring.       This incipient blueness goes
under the technical name of solarization.
   (50.) The successful practice of the art of Daguerreo
typing, therefore, depends on limiting the action of the sun
ray to the first moments of change in the iodide; for if the
exposure be continued too long, the high lights, become sta
tionary, whilst the shadows increase unduly in whiteness, and
all this happens long before solarization sets                                           in.

 tity, visible decomposition sets in, indicated by a blueness, and
 the sensitive surface once more renders evident the increments
of incident light.
    (53.) Or, by presenting a plate covered with a screen to a sky
that is clear or uniformly obscured, and with a regular motion,
withdrawing the screen deliberately from one end to the other,
and then suddenly screening the whole; it is plain that those
parts first uncovered will have received the greatest quantity
of light, and the others less and less. On mercurializing, it
will be seen that a stain will be evolved on the plate, as is
represented in fig. 5; from a to b the changes have been suc
cessive; from b to c no variation in the amount of whitening
is perceptible; at d solarization is commencing, which be
comes deeper and deeper to the end, e, of the stain.
    (54.) The plate from which the drawing of fig. 5 is taken,
gives from a to b ten parts, from b to c seventeen parts, from d
to e twelve parts; we perceive therefore how large an amount
of light is absorbed, and                        its
                                 effects rendered latent, between

setting in.

depends also on other principles, which, being liable to varia

this very iodide of silver, when in a thin yellow film, is de
composed by the feeblest rays of a taper, and even moon
light acts with energy; yet simply by altering the thickness

 examine the action of the rays impinging on them, and the
 rays reflected by them.
     Having prepared a second plate, B, and iodized it uniformly
 to a yellow, I deposit it in the camera, and now placing the
 first plate, A G, so that the rays coming on it through the
 window from the sky shall be specularly reflected to the ob
ject-glass of the camera, and the image of A G form upon B,
I   allow the exposure to continue until the yellow of A G is
 beginning to turn brown; then                       I
                                     shut the camera and mer
 curialize both plates.
     In consequence of what has been said (58.), it will be readily
 understood, that of the bands on A G, the first one, which is
the bare metal, does not whiten in the mercury vapour; the
 second, which is yellow, mercurializes powerfully; the third,
 which is red, is less affected; the fourth, which is blue, still
 less; and the fifth, which is lavender, hardly perceptible.
     But the changes on B, which have been brought about by
 the rays reflected from A G, are precisely the converse; the
 band, which is the image of b, is mercurialized powerfully;
                                             f
 that of c is untouched and absolutely black, d faintly
 stained, e whitened, and
than b.
                                 mercurialized,    but little less
   (65.) It follows from this, that a white stripe on B corre
sponds to a black one on A G, and the converse: and for the
depth of tint of the intermediate stripes those of the one are
perfectly complementary to the corresponding ones of the
other.
   By the aid of these results, we are now able to give an ac
count of the variability of sensitiveness in photogenic prepara
tions; the yellow iodide of silver is excessively sensitive, be
cause it absorbs              all

    This constant occurrence in so many carefully conducted
experiments, indicates a common source of error upon which
it is dependent; it can only be attributed to two causes.
One of these may be sought in the defects of the method of
analysis, the other in the supposition that the products of the
combustion (water and carbonic acid) have different compo
sitions from those usually assigned to them.             If indeed either
water or carbonic     acid contains somewhat less of hydrogen
or of carbon than we at present suppose, then as we calculate
 from the quantities found of the former bodies, the excess in
 the analyses is diminished in the same proportion.
    Let us suppose, for example, that carbonic acid contains
 only 76 carbon instead of 76°437 to 200 of oxygen, and water
 only 12 hydrogen instead of 12:4795 to 100 oxygen, and
 then we shall have no excess in any of the analyses quoted,
  whilst the experimental come to agree perfectly with the cal
  culated results.   Are we then entitled to make such changes
  in the atomic  weights,  proceeding as we do upon the assumed
  accuracy of experiments, which, from the complex nature of
  the apparatus, can make no claim to absolute precision; or

212                     Professors Redtenbacher and Liebig
ought we not first to compare these with other experiments,
in which this source of error is entirely avoided?
     Aquestion also arises, whether naphthalin, a substance the
atomic weight of which cannot be determined with certainty,
as it enters undecomposed into no combination, is a proper
substance to select as the means of determining the atomic
weight of carbon or of hydrogen 2 That body must indeed
be rejected on this account, for it is not in our power to con
trol our analytical results from a knowledge of the weight of
its atom, that      the sum   is,                 of
                                   the atomic weights        the elements                  of

                         on the Atomic Weight          of Carbon.                                 213
order conjointly to submit the atomic weight of carbon, as at
present received, to a severe and accurate scrutiny.
   It is known that two of the most distinguished natural phi
losophers, Biot and Arago, have, by means of the direct
weighing of carbonic acid, fixed upon the number 1519 for
the specific gravity of that gas. Their experiments were re
peated by Dulong and Berzelius, with whom, as regards skill
and talent, conscientiousness and accuracy, no others can be
compared.      The two last observers found the number 1:524
for the specific gravity of carbonic acid; that obtained by
De Saussure is 1:5269.
   The atomic weight of carbon, as calculated from the first
of these, is 75'530, and from the other, 76°437.            There is no
known    gas more    easily obtained in a    pure  state, or which can
more easily be distinguished from a foreign body, than car
bonic acid.     Any admixture of atmospheric air, or of other
gases, can only lower             its
                               specific gravity.
   Experiments have lately been conducted                  Rudberg       by                        on

and also by Dumas; as, for instance, those of alcohol, aether,
and acetone, the results of which agree either perfectly with
the specific gravity of carbon vapour, as deduced from that of
carbonic acid and of oxygen, or indicate it to be somewhat
higher; thus the specific gravity of aether vapour is 2:586
by experiment, and 2:580 by calculation; and that of the
vapour of alcohol is 1-6133 by experiment, and l'600 by cal
culation.
    In most of the observations of Dumas, the observed spe
cific gravity of bodies very rich in carbon, is far higher than
that obtained by calculation.            Thus, according to the formula
C, H2, the specific gravity of the vapour of naphthalin is
4.4882; the experiment of Dumas, however, gives 4-528, and
that of Woskresensky 4'672, from which it may with great
probability be concluded, that the specific gravity of carbon
vapour is rather higher than 0.42139, or 0.84279.
    The above-mentioned atomic weights of carbon, which
have resulted from direct experiments, are contradicted by

 has led some chemists               permit themselves the license

were multiples of the equivalent of hydrogen. It is in this
manner that the number 75 is arrived at as the atomic weight
of carbon, that number being very nearly the multiple of the
atomic weight of hydrogen, by the whole number 12.
   This is doubtless     an unusual mode                of controlling the accu
racy of an experiment, yet the numbers thus modified have
been admitted by many chemists.
   The fact that the atomic weights of simple bodies are very
nearly the multiples of that of hydrogen by whole numbers,
                                               .
is in itself nothing remarkable; there are other numerical
relations of this kind, which appear far more extraordinary,
on the strength of which, however, no one would think of
making a change in atomic weights.
 Thus,   if we
             add to the atomic         of potassium 489-92
 the atomic weight of lithium, which is . . . . . . . 80-83
 we obtain the number
the atomic weight of
                          º,     .   . . . . . . . .       .
and this divided by 2, gives 285:12; now this last is as near
                                 which in chemical properties is
a link between the two former bodies, as is the atomic weight
                                                                .   . . . . . 570-25
of that body obtained by multiplying that of hydrogen by a
whole number.
    Again, the sum of the atomic weights of barium and of
calcium, divided by 2, gives very nearly that of strontium;
the sum of those of chlorine and of iodine, divided by 2, gives
nearly that of bromine; and those of iron and cobalt, divided
by 2, give that of manganese.
    There are evidently hidden connexions in these numerical
relations, with which we are not acquainted, and to take them
as criteria, before they are understood, is obviously incon
sistent with the true spirit of philosophy; the same must be
admitted with respect to the hypothetical atomic weight of
carbon, 75, for the correctness of which as yet no experience
speaks.    The early determination of the atomic weight of
lead  by  Berzelius, entirely confirmed as it is by his later ex
periments in 1830, is in complete contradiction with the cor
rectness of atomic weights as multiples of that of hydrogen.

reference to our own investigation, and should not be for
gotten by chemists.       The following is an extract verbatim
 from his memoir *.

ning the atomic weight of a metal, that it might be supposed
the results obtained would enable us to settle the question,
whether or not the atomic weight of a metal is a multiple of
that of hydrogen; but the nearer we approach to absolute
accuracy, the greater are the obstacles we have to overcome
in arriving at such a point.       Besides, the circumstance that
very few bodies submitted to analysis are absolutely free from
all impurity,      from the substances from the compounds
                     or                                                                       of

   “These results, which range about between 1293 and 1296,
appear to prove that the atomic weight of lead lies between
those two numbers.     The mean of these experiments differs
so little from the number arrived at in my former ones,
namely, 1294°489, that I consider it unnecessary to alter the
latter.
  “If   the atomic weight of hydrogen is 12.5, then the atomic
weight of lead, supposing it to be a multiple of that number,
is exactly either 1287'5, or 1300; and if either of these num
bers be the true one, it appears to me that my results must
have oscillated about one of them; instead of which, they, as
we see, oscillate about a number which lies precisely midway
between the above-named.”
    It may therefore be concluded, that the fact of an atomic
number being a multiple of the equivalent of hydrogen is no
proof of      its
          exactness.

 be  the most certain and the most free from error          analytical                  in
chemistry.
    We can, for instance, estimate with great certainty the
atomic weights          many organic compounds, namely, nu
                                of
 merous organic acids,                  by
                              determining the proportions        which                        in

220                 Professors Redtenbacher and Liebig
 they combine with oxide of silver, or, what is the same thing,
 with metallic silver.    These organic acids contain several
 atoms of carbon, combined with oxygen and hydrogen in cer
 tain proportions, which can be ascertained with great facility.
 It is evident, that if the formulae of these acids are known
 with certainty, we obtain the sum of the weights of the atoms
 of carbon, by subtracting the sum of the atoms of oxygen
 and hydrogen which they contain from the atomic weights of
 their compounds, as accurately determined by means of their
 silver salts.  The sum of the atoms of carbon thus ascer
 tained, must, if the formerly received number for carbon be
 correct, be a multiple of it by a whole number, or it must                              in
 dicate how far that number differs from the true one. There
 is no substance, the atomic weight of which we believe to be
 known with greater certainty, and more precisely determined,
 than that of silver; the continued and important applications
 of it by Gay-Lussac, in his assay of silver in the wet way;
 indeed we may say, every one of his experiments on that sub
ject is a fresh proof of         its
                             correctness.

hind, from which the carbon cannot be expelled by subse
  quent calcination.         It is true, the carbon burns at the surface
 of the   carburet,    leaving    a stratum of pure silver, but this pro
 tects the inner      part     from the contact of oxygen; and when
 this residue is dissolved in dilute nitric acid, a net-work of
 pure carbon remains.
     The behaviour of the benzoate of silver is very similar to
 that of the cyanide; it is easily obtained perfectly pure, in
 beautiful shining crystals, which are not hygroscopic; when
 this salt, to the amount of 7 to 12 grammes, is heated, it melts
 and is decomposed; but even after being kept at a red heat
 for twelve hours, a very considerable quantity of carbon is
 found in the residue of silver.
     The oxalate of silver appeared at first to be the most appli
 cable of any in these determinations, but it is almost impos
 sible to obtain it anhydrous, besides which, when heated in
 large masses, it deflagrates in the same manner as the fulmi

formed with the same crucible, the weight of which therefore
was controlled whenever weighings were made.
    The calcination      of the acetate of silver proceeds very
easily, without    either swelling up or spirting.      The salt at
first becomes gray, and, on cautiously heating acetic acid,
distils off, and then the salt assumes a brown colour; at
length, when the odour of the acid is no longer observable,
there remains a gray skeleton of silver, which retains the form
of the salt burnt.      If the heat be now increased, and the lid
raised, so as to admit a current of air, a visible       glowing is
observed throughout the whole mass, and there             remains a
 spongy mass of shining white metallic silver.              -
     After cooling, the crucible with the silver is weighed, heated
 to redness anew, weighed again, and so on, until not the
 slightest change of weight is exhibited.      The absence of car
 buret of silver was always particularly demonstrated by dis
 solving the silver in dilute nitric acid.
     The weighings were effected with a balance, which indi
 cated quite distinctly half a millegramme, even when loaded
 with 20 grammes. The weights (made by Oerthing of Berlin)
  were carefully compared previously to employment, and were
  found to exhibit no appreciable variation in their subdivisions.
  Lastly, we adopted the precaution of conducting one-half of
 the experiments with newly prepared salt, by which means
 the fact, that the numbers yielded by salts prepared by di<U+017F>
 ferent operations agree, is rendered very obvious.
     The tartrate of silver is not easily obtained in a crystalline
  form.    When the nitrate of silver is precipitated in the cold
  by a solution of pure Rochelle salt, from which, by the addi
  tion of a little nitric acid, the weak alkaline reaction which it
  generally possesses has been removed, a caseous and not a
  crystalline precipitate is formed.      On the other hand, if the
  precipitation is effected by mixing boiling hot and dilute solu
  tions, the liquid becomes brownish, but not turbid, and on
  cooling, metallic silver in brown laminae falls down.       Again,
  when a dilute solution of nitrate of silver is heated to from
  80° to  85°C., and to this     a hot concentrated solution of the
  tartrate of potass and soda is added, a precipitate falls, which,
  by agitating, at first disappears; if the addition of the tartrate
  of potass and soda be discontinued as soon as the precipitate
  is permanent, and is not redissolved, fine scales of the tartrate
  of silver separate on cooling, which, after being well washed
  and dried, are very white, and have a metallic lustre, resem

 bling that of polished silver. In this process the liquid must
 always contain a slight excess of the nitrate of silver.
    The pure tartrate of silver was dried, and       silver deter              its
 mined        by
             means         calcination, observing the same rules

                                      the acetate.     By gently heating
 the salt pyrotartaric and carbonic acids distil off, and there
 remains, without spirting           swelling,  or spongy mass   a   bright               of

 water containing ammonia, and again thrown down                     means                by
 of nitric acid. The acid racemate of ammonia thus obtained
 was brilliantly white, and perfectly pure.          This was employed
 in  the preparation                  of
                            crystallized    racemate     silver, exactly  of                         in

  Since, after frequently washing this silver salt with water, the
 fluid still contained traces         lime, the whole precipitate was

     It   will be observed on first sight, with respect to the pro
 portion of oxide and of acid in each particular salt, that our
 results yield the same number up to the third, and in many
 cases to the fourth figure; and, in our opinion, a better selec
 tion of salts could scarcely be made than that which was
 adopted, for the proportion of oxygen in these four salts is
just as unequal as that of the hydrogen; hence if an error
 had been occasioned by the hydrogen, it could not possibly
 escape observation.
     In the acetic, malic, racemic, and tartaric acids, the oxygen
 is as the numbers 3, 4, 5, and the hydrogen as 4:6.

    With   such coincidence as is exhibited in our analyses, the
existence of any foreign admixture in these salts, which could
have increased the atomic weight of carbon, cannot be sup
posed.      We have, however, still another direct proof of their
correctness, viz. in the results which Berzelius obtained in his
analyses of the tartrate, and of the racemate of lead.                                These

                 on the Atomic Weight      of Carbon.                227
    If we compare our experiments separately with one another,
 that is to say, the atomic weight of carbon as deduced from
 the one salt, with that from the others, we observe that the
 numbers obtained in the analyses of the same salt, agree more
 perfectly with one another, than do the mean numbers result
 ing from the analyses of the different silver salts.
    If the experiments themselves be assumed to be perfectly
 exact, this discrepancy must, from the very nature of things,
 result from some cause. This cause can be no other than the
 difference between the specific gravities of the different salts.
  They were weighed, not in vacuo, but in air, and in the pro
 portion of their unequal densities, they must displace unequal
 volumes of air.      All these salts in the above weighings must
 lose weight, and those which are specifically lighter more
 than the specifically heavier salts. Dr. Clark, at the meetin
 of the British Association held at Birmingham in 1839,             ...i
 attention to the influence which these relations exert on deter
 minations by weight, and corrected the experiments of Berze
 lius accordingly.       It is clear, that in weighing of from one
 to two   grammes     of substance, these differences will not affect
 the relation of numbers, but when 20 or more grammes are
  weighed, the correction ought not to be neglected.
     Such a correction must result from a knowledge of the spe
                      º
 cific gravities of salts.      We determined those of the four
 salts analysed by us, by taking a known weight of the salt in
 a saturated solution, and comparing the specific gravity of
 this liquid with that of pure water.
    3'1281 gr. acetate of silver displaced 1 gr. = 1 c. c. water
 at 15° C.       But I c. c. of air at that temperature weighs
 0.00123    gr. (log.  0-0905137–2); 28:800 gr, acetate of silver
 displaces therefore 0.0113 gr. atmospheric air. These 28:803
 gr. of salt weigh                    28:814 gr., but the weight was
 estimated    by  means of a brass weight of 28:803 gr., which
 having the   sp.  gr. 7-8, displaced 0-00455 gr.    of   air; that  is   to
 say,it  lost that weight   in  air.
    The above 28:814 gr.     of   acetateof   silver, weighed therefore
28:8098    gr., and the 18:612    gr.
                                    of   metallic silver which remains
behind after the calcination weighed only 1861            13 grammes.
    According    to   these corrections, 28.8098 gr.      of  the silver
                        gr.
                    in 13
salt, yield 18.61           of metallic silver.
  If   we correct       this manner the atomic weights         ofthe tar
trate, racemate, and malate       of   silver, the specific gravities     of
which are   in  vacuo, respectively–      3:4321, 3,7752, and 4:0016,
we obtain the following results:-

I SHOULD           have been unwilling to advert again to the
      subject of discussion between Mr. Airy and myself, unless
it had appeared to me, after reading Mr. Airy's Reply in the
August Number (p. 143), that something may yet be said in elu
cidation of this confessedly difficult question. Mr. Airy may feel
assured that            I
                 have no fault to find with the manner in which
he supports his own views, and that equally with him I am
persuaded of the necessity of adhering to strictly legitimate
principles in treating questions of this nature.     By placing my
reasoning under another point of view,        hope to show that it               I
is not defective in this respect.
    But first I must remark, that the argument by which Mr.
 Airy concludes that Poisson's solution is possible and mine
 impossible, is nothing to the purpose.        was fully aware that              I
 my solution would not satisfy the equation by which Mr. Airy
 has tried

236       Dr. Mallet         on the production                of Sulphuretted Hydrogen.
 I  have for some time devoted a good deal of attention, namely,
  the action of “air and water on iron,” and other metals.
     To Mr. Daniell must be awarded the merit of having first
  pointed out the very extended limits in which sulphuretted
  hydrogen thus occurs, and of indicating                   highly probable  its
 connexion with       pestilential    diseases;   but the claim which

   At the time I wrote, I believed myself the first who had observed
the vesicle alluded to; but by a reference to the manuscript in the
archives of the Society, it will be seen, from a postscript, that before
sending it to be communicated, I had become aware that M. Coste
of Paris had some time before announced that he had made a similar
observation, as far as concerns the rabbit.          Those who are conver
sant in such matters are doubtless aware that I was anticipated also
by Professor Valentin: but of this circumstance I was not informed
till some considerable time after.
    It thus appears that, though I was an independent discoverer of
the germinal vesicle of the mammiferous ovum, all the share in the
discovery I can lay claim to historically is that of being the first who
pointed it out in this country.
    There is one point, however, in the anatomy of the germinal ve
sicle of the mammiferous ovum, of which I feel myself entitled to be
recognized, especially by the Royal Society, as contemporaneous dis
coverer, and that             is,

inches, and focus of nearly eleven feet, armed with a power of 320,
though the character of the night (October 27) was very indifferent,
I was immediately struck with the elongated appearance of the
smaller of the two stars; and having applied higher powers, I pro
cured measures of the direction of the elongation.         I have since
obtained two other sets with power 420, with which, in best mo

three-nights’ observations are:—

   The author states that the Admiralty having left to his decision
the form and construction of a new pendulum, which they had re
solved on sending out to the Cape, for the purpose of being swung
by Mr. Maclear at the several stations of the trigonometrical survey
now in progress in that colony, he had not hesitated in adopting
the bar-pendulum, as by far the best and most convenient for a
travelling instrument.     The pendulum which has been accordingly
constructed is a brass    bar, sixty inches long, two inches wide, and
about half an inch thick.    It was formed of several thin plates which
were  pressed together  by  a rolling machine, and        consequently,                    is,
 very compact and hard.          Its specific gravity was 860, and            rate                       its

                                            one and the same bar, and which
 thus serve as        check on each other. As the construction of the
                           a
 pendulum did not allow             much filing away
                                               of               the ends without      at
 cutting into the knee-pieces, the vibrations                 the several knife      on

   The copper plates of batteries are submitted to one of four pro
 cesses, which gives them a surface analogous to that of Mr. Smee's
 platinized platinum.   One of the methods is to deposit copper on
 them by electrolysis.  The action of such plates in combination with
 amalgamated     zinc is both powerful and constant.

    This discovery enables us to multiply in a durable material the
 fleeting and delicate traces of Daguerréotype.    The plate to be etched
 is made a positive electrode, in an electrolyte of dilute hydrochloric
 acid; and the action is continued for a few seconds. The etchings
 are     for the printer.

248               Royal Irish Academy:—Dr. Kane on the
    Any body which vibrates    as a single mass gives origin at the
same moment to two      waves,  whose motions are in opposite direc
tions, and of which one is rarefied and the other condensed.
   If these two arrive at the tympanum at the same moment and with
equal power, perfect neutralization should result, and no sound be
heard: hence, where a vibratory body produces upon the ear the
sensation of sound, it arises from one wave of the two being either
totally intercepted, or, at least, diminished in force, and the loudness
of the sound is proportional to the difference of the intensity of the
two waves when they affect the ear.
   All instruments for increasing sound, and producing resonance,
act upon this principle.
   The following facts will illustrate these principles in detail.   A
tuning fork is a centre of four waves, two + and
two     –,but unless it be very close to the ear, no        +-
sound is heard from it; because the centre of all
the four waves being very close,         act      the
                                                 (ap-

Thus, Mr. Adams showed long since, that when two closed tubes
are placed at right angles to each other, they interfere when made
to speak to a tuning fork, and for this effect no explanation has
hitherto been given.   But it is evident that the tubes being at right
angles to each other, the waves destroyed
                                                are in opposite phases,
and those which remain are in opposite phases
also, so that the effect is the same as if no
tubes were present at all.        The same effect
may be produced by a single tube, bent so that
 its apertures may          right anglesbe    at
                                               each                          to

      All these principles have received very full verification from an
  instrument constructed for the purpose, and termed a Chorizophone.
   It consists of a square glass plate, which is placed above a set of
  closed tubes of such size, that when the plate vibrates in four pieces,
  with diagonal nodal lines, the length of each tube is half the length
  of the phase of the wave produced, and their form is triangular, of
  the magnitude of one of the four vibrating portions of the plate;
  when one of these tubes is presented to the plate, and this brought
  to vibrate by a violin bow applied to the centre of one of the sides,
  the tube resounds, and more loudly in proportion as the plate is
  brought nearer to              its
                               orifice.    Now here the entire wave from the
  plate is  caught          by

  it affords the only example of a nitrate which does not yield nitric
  acid by the action of sulphuric acid, and at the same time give up
  its base to this acid, more fixed and energetic than nitric acid.
      When the proportion of sulphuric acid is most diminished, opera
  ting, for example, with ten parts to one of nitrate of ammonia, about
 three-fourths of the salt are decomposed into nitric acid and am
 monia, and one-fourth into nitrous oxide and water.       By gradually
 diminishing the proportion of sulphuric acid, but little nitrous oxide
 is obtained, so that with one equivalent of nitrate of ammonia and
 two equivalents of sulphuric acid,the phaenomena coincide with those
 of the decomposition of a salt by a more fixed acid.
     When a mixture of nitrate of ammonia and a large excess of sul
 phuric acid is heated only between about 200° and 250°Fahr. in
 stead of 322°Fahr., nitric acid distils, but without the production
 of any nitrous oxide. When nitrite of ammonia is heated with a
 great proportion of concentrated sulphuric acid, it is converted as
 by the mere action of heat into azote and water.
     It appears from the preceding statements, that very different re
 sults are obtained by varying the proportions of nitrate of ammonia,
 sulphuric acid, the quantity of water and the temperature employed.

     about 322° Fahr., pure azote gas, perfectly unmixed nitrous

  CONCENTRATION OF NITRIC ACID BY MEANS OF SULPHURIC

                                                of                       solution                a                     of

sulphuric aether and weak alcohol.               The aether dissolved the pure

rated to drymess, and the product was subjected to the action                           of
aether mixed with a fifth of rectified alcohol.
   The liquid, treated with excess of carbonate of lime, was left in
contact in the cold   with alcohol. Hot distilled water was afterwards
shaken with the undissolved residue, and after having been filtered,
evaporation was carefully conducted.       The product of this last ope
ration was a soluble    salt, which crystallized  on standing, and pos
sessed all the well-known characters of lactate of lime.         If excess
of nitric acid be used instead of oxalic acid, oxalate of lime is obtained
instead of lactate, for the nitric acid converts the lactic into oxalic
acid.
     MM. Cap and Henry observe, that it appears to them evidently to
result from the preceding experiments, that after having separated
the microcosmic salt from the evaporated urine, and saturated the
lactic and phosphoric acid in excess, and having obtained a crystal
lized product by the intervention of alcoholized aether, in which pro
duct M. Lecanu admitted the presence of lactic acid and urea; that
these crystals have the form and characters very distinct from those
which belong to pure urea, and that they perfectly resemble those
procured by the direct action of lactic acid on urea; lastly, that
the hydrates of zinc, barytes, lime and oxalic acid, occasion in these
crystals the production of lactates of zinc, barytes and lime, and
separate lactic acid; they observe that it is impossible to demon
strate in a more direct manner the existence of a compound of these
two principles.—Journal de Pharmacie, xxvii. 356.

                                      found that three feet of
the thin wire could conduct exactly as well as eight feet of the
thick wire; and hence it is evident that the resistances of two
yards of each were in the ratio of 3:4 to 1:27, which approxi
mates very closely to the ratio of the heating effects exhibited
 by the experiment.
    11. Exp.       2.-Inow substituted a piece of iron wire ºrth
 of an inch     thick,  and two yards long, for the thick copper
 wire used in Exp. 1, and placed each coil in half a pound
 of water.     A current of 1°25 Q was passed through both
 during one hour, when the augmentation of temperature
 caused by the iron was 6°, whilst that produced by the
 copper wire was 5°-5.          In this case the resistances of the
 iron and    copper   wires were found to be in the ratio of 6 to
  5'51.
     12. Exp.       3.-Acoil of copper wire was then compared with
  one of   mercury,    which was accomplished by inclosing the
  latter in a bent  glass  tube.    In this way I had immersed, each
  in half a pound of water, 11+ feet of copper wire ºth of an
  inch thick, and 22% inches of mercury 0.065 of an inch
  in diameter. At the close of one hour, during which the
  same current of electricity was passed through both, the
  former had caused a rise of temperature of 4°4, the latter of
  2°9. The resistances were found by a careful experiment to
  be in the ratio of 4.4 to 3.
      13. Other trials were made with results of precisely the

    produced in the cells of the battery, and when electrolytes
    are experiencing the action of the voltaic current.          It has
    been my desire to render these experiments strictly com

    which either specific heat, or other disturbing causes might
    require, and have by these means been able to express, in
    every case, the total amount of evolved heat.
       21. The first of these corrections, which I call Cor. A,
    arises from the difference between the mean temperature of
    the liquid used in an experiment, and that of the surrounding

 corrected heat produced by the dissolution      of 100 grains of
 the oxide of zinc in sulphuric acid, is able to raise two pounds
 of water 3° 44.

                      constructed a single voltaic pair, consisting
  of thin plates of amalgamated zinc and platinized silver (Mr.
  Smee's arrangement):     the plates were two inches broad, and
  were   kept one inch asunder by means of a piece of wood, to
  the opposite sides of which they were bound with string: to
  the top of each plate, a thick copper wire formed a good me
  tallic connexion, by means of a brass clamp.         The voltaic
  pair, thus prepared, was immersed in two pounds of sulphuric
  acid, sp. gr. 1137, contained by one of the earthenware jars
   (22.). The arrangement is represented by fig. 3.
      31. When the circuit was completed so              -

  the needle first advanced a little from 50°, and then declined

 leaves  2°1, the correct voltaic heat.
    33. Assuming in this case, as well as in that of a metallic
 conductor, that the heat evolved is proportional to the resist
 ance    multiplied     by the square      of the electric intensity, we
                                                  (1.8)?

    34. FXp.      2.-I      now constructed     another pair, consisting
 of plates precisely similar to those used in Exp. 1, but half
 an inch only asunder: it was also immersed in two pounds of
 sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1137. The circuit was closed for one
 hour, during which the needle of the galvanometer advanced
 gradually from 47}* to 504°, , the mean deviation being
 49° 35' = 1984 Q.            The liquid had then gained 4°8: this,
  + 0°-1 (for Cor. A) and —0°-5 (for Cor. B), = 4°4.                  The
 heat due to the dissolution of oxide of zinc is in this case

r' = 0-275: the mean resistance was therefore 0.293.                 Now,

    36. Exp.     3.-I     formed another pair on Mr. Smee's plan;
it was similar to the last, with the exception that the plates
were only one inch broad.             When the circuit was closed, a
current of the mean intensity 19:46 Q passed through the
apparatus during one half hour. The heat thereby produced,

          Conductors       of Electricity, and during Electrolysis,                   269
when corrected, and reduced on account      of the dissolution of
oxide of zinc, was 0°-84.
   37. In this instance the mean resistance was 0.32; whence,
by a calculation precisely similar to those given under Exps.
1 and 2, we have the theoretical amount of heat = 0°74.
   38. The three instances above given, are specimens taken
from a number of experiments with the platinized silver pairs.
The mean of the eight unexceptionable experiments which
I  have made with them, gives 2°08 of actual, and 2°13 of
 theoretical heat, and not one of the individual experiments
presented a greater difference between real and calculated
heat, than Exp. 2.
    39. Exp. 4.—A plate of copper, four inches broad, was
 bent about a plate of amalgamated zinc three inches and a
 half broad, so as to form a pair of Wollaston's double battery.
 It was placed in a jar containing two pounds of dilute sul
 phuric acid. In this instance, the total voltaic heat that was
 generated was 1°2, the calculated result being 1°0 only.
 Repeated experiments with the copper pairs gave similar
 results, the real heat being invariably somewhat superior
 to that which the doctrine of resistances would demand.
 The cause of this I have found in a slight local action, which
 it is almost impossible to avoid in the common copper bat
terv.
     #. Exp. 5.—I    now constructed a single pair on Mr.
Grove's  plan.  The platinum, two inches broad, was immersed
in an ounce and a half of strong nitric acid contained by a
4-inch pipe-clay cell; the amalgamated zinc plate, also two
inches broad, was immersed (at the distance of an inch and
a half from the platinum) in thirty ounces of sulphuric acid,
    sp.
    gr. 1156.    The whole was contained      one            by

the thermometer immersed in the dilute sulphuric acid stood

   44. Exp. 6 was made with a pair in every respect similar
to the last: the circuit, however, was completed by means of
a thin copper wire, in order to reduce the intensity of the
current.     At the end of one hour, during which the needle of
the   galvanometer       advanced gradually from 41° to 42°, the
 correct voltaic heat that was generated was 1°7. The theo-
 retical result was 1°82.
    45.  I  was desirous of knowing how far the same principles
 would apply to the heat generated in Prof. Daniell's constant
 battery. But in this battery considerable cold is produced, in
 consequence of the separation of oxide of copper from the
 sulphuric acid to which it is combined. This is altogether a
 secondary effect, and should be eliminated as decidedly as
 the heat produced by the dissolution of oxide of zinc.         I have
 not yet been able to obtain accurate data for the correction
 thus needed, and shall therefore content myself with remark
 ing, that my results with Mr. Daniell's arrangements are, as
 far as they go, quite consistent with the theory of resistances.
    46. Experiments, such as I have related, were varied in
 many ways; and sometimes a number of pairs were arranged
 so as to form a battery.         Still the results were similar, and
 established the fact, that the heat which is generated in a given
 time in any pair, by true voltaic action, is proportional to the
 resistance to conduction of that pair, multiplied by the square
 of the intensity of the current.
    47.   I
                                       jº,
            now made some experiments on the heat consequent
 to the passage of voltaic electricity through electrolytes.
    48. Exp. 7-Two pieces of                      foil, each of which
 was an inch     long,   and a quarter   of an inch broad, were her

      Conductors        of Electricity, and during Electrolysis.                                   271
metically sealed into the ends of two pieces of glass tubing:
within these tubes, pieces of copper wire were metallically
connected with the platinum; these, when the apparatus was
in action, terminated in mercury cups.         The tubes thus pre
pared were bound together by thread, so as to keep the pieces
of platinum foil at the constant distance of half an inch asun
der.   This apparatus was immersed in two pounds of dilute
sulphuric acid, sp. gr. 1154, contained in one of the jars (22.).
    49. A battery of twenty-four inch, double iron-zinc plates,
 was then placed, with     divided troughs (which were charged

sent through two pounds of dilute sulphuric acid for half an
hour, during which the correct heat that was generated was
3°-09.
   61. In order to find the true resistance to conduction of
the decomposing cell, it was necessary to remember that in
this instance one-third of the intensity of the ten pairs was
expended in overcoming the resistance to electrolyzation of
the water.     With this exception the calculations were made
precisely as before, and gave 376, the resistance of the cell;
whence we have the theoretical heat 2°88.

 for them two pieces of platinum foil, dipping to the bottom
 of the liquid; they were one inch apart, and each presented
 to the dilute sulphuric acid a surface of seven square inches.
 In this case I used twenty pairs of zinc-iron plates arranged
 in a series of ten.
    63. The mean of six experiments with this apparatus gave
 4°49 of real, and 4° 13 of theoretical heat. I have no doubt
 that the difference is principally occasioned by the formation
 of the deutoxide of hydrogen, which is known to occur to a
 considerable extent when oxygen is evolved from an extended
 surface.    Of this we have another instance in the following
 experiment.

             have thus arrived at the general conclusion, that
the heat which is evolved by the proper action of any vol
taic current is proportional to the square of the intensity of
that current, multiplied by the resistance to conduction which it
experiences.   From this law the following conclusions are                                                         di
rectly deduced : —
   69. 1st. That                       if
                     the electrodes of a galvanic pair of given
intensity be connected by any simply conducting body, the total
voltaic heat generated by the entire circuit (provided always
that no local action occurs in the pair) will, whatever may be
the resistance to conduction, be proportional to the number of
atoms (whether of water or of sinc) concerned in generating
the current.    For if the resistance to conduction be diminished,
the quantity of current will be increased in the same ratio, and
hence, according to the law (68.), the quantity of heat which
would thus be generated in a given time will be also propor
tionally increased; whilst of course the number of atoms
which would be electrolyzed in the pair will be increased in
the same proportion.
   70. 2nd. That the total voltaic heat which is produced by any
pair, is directly proportional to       intensity, and the number       its                                         of

276      Mr.   J. P. Joule on   the   Heat evolved by Metallic
oxygen may be considered almost decisive of the question.
In his unexceptionable experiments, one grain of hydrogen
produced heat sufficient to raise one pound of water 9°6.
Now we know from Exp. 5, that the heat generated in one
                 -                     -
of Mr. Grove's pairs by the electrolysis

grains of zinc, is theoretically 3°46; and the heat which must
in the same time have been generated by the metallic part of
                                                          0-06
the circuit, which presented the resistance 0:06, is 0.427
x 3°46 = 0°48: the total voltaic heat               was therefore 3°-94.
Hence the total heat which would have been evolved by the
                                                                         2

one pound of water, is 9°-9.   But from the table of the                 in
tensities of voltaic arrangements (74.), the intensity of Mr.
Grove's pair, compared with the affinity of hydrogen for oxy
gen,            whence, from (70.), we have 9°-9x0.93 = 9°2,
the heat which should be generated by the combustion of one
grain of hydrogen, according to the doctrine of resistances:
the result of Crawford is only 0°4 more.
   73. I am aware that there are some anomalous conditions
of the current which seem to militate against the general law
(68.), particularly when in the hands of Peltier it actually
produces coldº. I have little doubt, however, that the ex
planations of these will be ultimately found in actions of a
secondary character.

   74.   In the foregoing investigation        I   have had occasion to
work very extensively with different voltaic arrangements,
and have repeatedly ascertained their relative intensities by
the mathematical theory of Ohm.      It will not, therefore,                 I
hope, be deemed out of place to subjoin a table, in which the
intensities of the batteries which are most generally used, are
inversely as the number of pairs which would be just requisite
in order to overcome the resistance of water to electrolyza
tion.

    published in the Journ...f. Prakt. Chem. for June 15th, 1841,
we find the following important notice:—“On preparing the
interesting memoir of Dumas on the decomposition of organic
substances, by the action of the hydrate of potash, for my
Annual Report, it occurred to me that nitrogenous bodies
should, when so treated, give off the whole amount of their
nitrogen as ammonia, which may be received in muriatic acid
just in the same manner as carbonic acid in a solution of pot
ash, and weighed as ammonio-chloride of platinum.         am fol                              I

the formation of cyanogen, we have commenced with com
pounds of cyanogen, which give ammonia just as well as sal
ammoniac and lime.          indeed,  If,                  all
                                        should succeed according

perature, only reduced copper occurs.                  When the green
powder is heated over a spirit-lamp, a beautiful combustion
appears before red heat; at the same time it is converted with
violent disengagement of nitrogen into metallic copper: this
 indicates that the green powder is a combination of nitrogen
with copper, which is confirmed by numerous experiments.
 The formation of the nitruret of copper takes place long be
 fore the boiling point of linseed oil, and, in fact, at 250° C.,
while the reduction of the oxide of copper, by means of hy
drogen, only takes place at the boiling point. The degree of
 division of the oxide is of much importance, and it is best to
employ an oxide prepared by precipitating a hot solution of
the nitrate of copper with caustic potash, and boiling.                Even
 with this  precaution     it is difficult to prepare   a nitruret of cop
per perfectly free from oxide; for, after the action of am

                          Action      of Ammonia               on glowing Charcoal.                                  281
£ff      Liebig observed, that on heating the bichromate of the per
      chloride of chromium with ammonia, or the chloride of chro
i     nium in gaseous ammonia, metallic chromium is obtained;
      the metal obtained, according to these two methods, exhibits,
      however, very different properties; the first being a black
      powder, which, under the steel, acquires a metallic lustre, while
      the latter has a dull chocolate-brown colour. This difference
      in the properties induced M. Schrötter to examine them more
      accurately: he found, that on heating the brown powder in a
      combustion-tube, from which atmospheric air had been ex
      pelled by means of carbonic acid, a beautiful incandescence
      ensued, accompanied by a violent disengagement of gas, which
      proved to be nitrogen mixed with nitric oxide.           Another ex
      periment showed that the substance contained no hydrogen;
      it  is,
            therefore, nitruret      chromium.      Its composition

 acid being decomposed at the temperature at which the ac
tion takes place; at the same time quadricarburet of hydrogen
is evolved. The decomposition may be expressed by the for
mula 3 C + 2 Nº Hº = N*C*H*, Nº Hº + CH".             The ener
getic action of charcoal on ammonia may be turned to ac
count in preparing anhydrous prussic acid. For this purpose
dried ammonia is passed through a porcelain tube containing
small pieces of red-hot charcoal; the escaping gases, containing
much prussiate of ammonia, are conveyed into dilute sulphuric
acid, warmed to about 50°; the ammonia is detained by the
sulphuric acid, and only prussic acid escapes, which is con
densed in a vessel surrounded by a frigorific mixture. The
acid thus obtained is quite as pure as that from the decom
position of cyanide of mercury by means of hydrochloric acid.
This action of carbon with ammonia may also be employed in
the preparation of the ferrocyanide of potassium; the vapour
of the prussiate of ammonia is passed into a solution of caustic
potash, in which the hydrate of the protoxide of iron is sus
pended.
   Similar experiments on the action of ammonia on red-hot
charcoal have been published by M. Langlois in the Annales
de Chim. et de Phys. 3ième Sér. t. i. p. 117, which agree with
the above, with the exception that the gas which escapes at the
formation of the prussiate of ammonia, is stated to contain nei
ther nitrogen nor carburetted hydrogen, but to be pure hydro
gen. To explain the decomposition M. Langlois adopts the
notion, that one equiv. of ammonia, N*H", becomes, on con
tact with incandescent charcoal, N° Hº + H+; the two equiv.
of hydrogen are then replaced by two equiv. carbon to form
prussic acid, which immediately enters into combination with
one equiv. of undecomposed ammonia; a portion of the hy
drogen of the ammonia being replaced by carbon exactly as
the oxygen of the metallic oxides by chlorine, when exposed
with the latter to a high temperature. O. 114 of the salt gave
0.340 cyanide of silver, corresponding to 0-068 prussic acid,
which gives the formula N*H" + C*N* H3.
      Double Cyanurets   of Zinc with Alkalies and Earths.
   Samselius has found that these combinations may likewise
be obtained, (besides in the usual moist way, by dissolving cya
nide of zinc in the alkaline cyanides,) by mixing the alkaline
cyanides with carbonate, or any other salt of the oxide of zinc,
as long as the cyanide of zinc is redissolved, upon which the
double salt is obtained on evaporation, at least, as far as may
be concluded from the action with cyanide of potassium.
Caustic ammonia dissolves cyanide of zinc, and soon deposits

the double salt.   The double salt of barytes cannot be ob
tained by precipitating   a solution of cyanide of zinc-potassium
with acetate of  barytes.    It gives a white precipitate, insolu
ble, or nearly so, which contains barytes, with evolution of
a strong smell of prussic acid. A corresponding combination
with oxide of lead was obtained on precipitating cyanide of
zinc-potassium with acetate of lead. It forms a white powder.
Acetic acid removes the lead, leaving cyanide of zinc behind.
The compound was not analysed, but regarded as Zn Cy-F Pb.
This kind of combination of a cyanide with an oxide of another
metal will be new and remarkable, should it be confirmed. Cya
nide of zinc-magnesium could not be prepared; the cyanogen
is decomposed during evaporation, and a brown substance is
deposited.—(Bers.                 Jahresber. vol. xx, part                       ii.   p.   153.)

                     cos (4–w) sin (4–w).
Putting these values of                             cosº,          sin” 4        in the first member                     of
(V.) and eliminating,                          we      find

                       sin 2 w sin 2 (4–w) = 0 . . . . (VI.)
   Now as p is   quite  arbitrary, we may       assume it dif
fering in value from w, hence we may consider sin 2 (4 — wy
as always different from zero; dividing then by this factor,
equation (VI.) is thus reduced to
                                          (A–B)
                                  = 0 . . . . . . . (VII.)sin 2      w
This equation is satisfied when A = B by any values of w,
or, in other words, when the moments of inertia round two of
the principal                   axes passing through                         the centre          of gravity are
equal; any pair of rectangular axes in a plane perpendicular
to the third principal axe are also principal axes.
   When A is not equal to B, equation (VII.) can only be
satisfied                by the values              w   =     0, or      w   =       º,        or   the    principal
axe        Oa' coincides                  with      O.r, which is parallel to G X, hence
we may deduce the following theorem:—
   The principal aires of rotation of a body passing through
any point assumed on one of the three principal aires through
the centre of gravity, are always parallel to these aves.

      SMITH, Esq.
                      To Itichard Phillips, Esq.
         DEAR SIR,
               Transactions of the Royal Society    of Edinburgh of
  INthistheyear,    some experiments have been      detailed by Dr.
  S.   M. Brown, announcing the startling discovery, that carbon
  in certain states of combination, is susceptible of conversion
  into silicon, and inviting a repetition of the trials made by
  the author.
       Anxious to satisfy ourselves respecting the accuracy of the
  statements made by Dr. Brown, we instituted the subjoined
  experiments for the purpose of verifying the results which he
   details.
       In his experiments Dr. Brown has made use of paracyano
  gen, obtained by the decomposition of the bicyanide of mer
  cury; the paracyanogen employed by us was produced by
  the decomposition of hydrocyanic acid; this was of a brownish
  black colour, and soluble in sulphuric acid, from which it was
  precipitated on the addition of water.       It contained traces of
   sulphate of lime and iron.
       We have deemed it unnecessary to repeat the whole of the
  numerous and, in many cases, prolonged experiments given
  in the paper, but have selected those which bore most directly
  on the stated transformation;       the modes of procedure and
  the results arrived at  by  us, we shall describe without explana
   tion or comment.
       In page 231 of the Transactions we find it stated, that a
  tightly luted Berlin porcelain crucible, filled with paracyano
     en, was imbedded in stucco paste and exposed to a white
     eat for an hour and a half.     The residue of this experiment
   was a dark brown infusible substance like charcoal; this, when
  ignited with carbonate of potash, and the product treated with
  hydrochloric acid, is described as leaving a fine white gritty
  powder insoluble in acids and alkalies, infusible in micro
  cosmic salt, and dissolving with effervescence in fused car
  bonate of potash, and then forming a solution in water, from
  which it was separable as a bulky gelatinous precipitate by
  acids, which precipitate was soluble both in acids and            al
  kalies, and insoluble in either after ignition to redness.      It is
  further stated, that “two grains of the dark ignited substance
  procured by the last process yielded 411 grs. of silicic acid;
  one grain, 2.06 grs., and 0.8 gr. 1:57.”
       This experiment was repeated in the following manner:—50

296    Dr. R. H. Brett and Mr.     J. D. Smith's Experiments
grs. of paracyanogen, obtained by the spontaneous decomposi
tion of prussic acid, were stuffed into a small crucible of Ber
lin porcelain furnished with a cover; this covered crucible was
completely imbedded in plaster of Paris made into a paste
with water, in a Hessian crucible; a cover was then placed
over the latter and luted with China clay.
    This apparatus was placed in a sand-bath to dry, and after
wards submitted for three hours to a full red heat; when cold,
the smaller crucible was carefully opened; there was found a
perfectly black carbonaceous-looking residue, weighing 4 grs.;
this black residue was ignited in a platinum capsule over a
gas flame, and there remained a very inconsiderable light
and grayish-coloured ash, which, when boiled in aqua regia,
entirely dissolved.    The ash in question consisted of sulphate
of lime and traces of oxide of iron.—(R. H. B.)
    Again, 50 grs. of paracyanogen were placed in a porcelain
crucible under precisely similar circumstances to the last ex
periment.     The crucibles in this case were exposed to a full
white heat for two hours.       When the smaller crucible was
opened, a black residue, like that obtained in the former ex
periment, was found; this residue, when burnt in a platinum
crucible with access of air, was consumed, with the exception
of a trifling ash entirely soluble in aqua regia, and consisting
of sulphate of lime and oxide of iron, as in the former expe
riment.—(R. H. B.)
    Not content with the results of the two experiments just
detailed, 50 grs. of paracyanogen were again subjected to an
intense white heat in a furnace capable of fusing metallic iron
and manganese, having previously rammed it tightly into a
Berlin crucible, to which was adapted a suitable cover; these
were luted together very carefully; when the luting, which
then presented no cracks, was dry, this crucible was placed
in an earthen one, and the vacant space filled up with a
ferruginous sand; this again was covered and securely luted;
after ignition for two hours it was withdrawn, when the resi
duum proved to be a perfectly black substance, exactly re
sembling that mentioned in the former experiments, weighing
about 5 grs. The sand had agglomerated into a solid mass
                            j.
 resembling soft white sandstone, and owing to a portion of
 this getting mixed with the black residue in the crucible, the
 exact weight could not be ascertained. The interior glaze of
 the crucible, to the level of the original bulk of the paracy
 anogen, had assumed a black colour with a shade of brown,
 which apparently penetrated to the depth of the glaze, but no
 further; on exposure to long-continued heat with free access
 of air, this black lining              but a very slight, if any,

        on the alleged Conversion                              of Carbon into Silicon.           297
change    of tint. Having carefully selected 3.5 grs. of the
black residue so as to procure it free from the accidental ad
mixture of sand, they were mixed with 20 grs. of carbonate of
potash prepared from the bitartrate and free from silica; this
mixture, which was perfectly black, was ignited for half an hour
in a closed platinum crucible, which was itself placed in a
covered earthen crucible carefully luted; the fused residue
was black, and when treated with water left a black insoluble
powder; this, washed, collected, dried, and ignited in a pla
tinum capsule and in contact with air, glowed like ignited
carbonaceous matter, and left an ash-coloured residue, which,
treated with chlorate and carbonate of potash, gave a fused
residuum entirely soluble in water; this solution, evaporated
to dryness with the addition of hydrochloric acid in excess,
and subsequently ignited, gave a slightly turbid solution with
water, which became perfectly clear on the addition of hydro
chloric acid; this solution contained traces of platinum.   The
first solution of carbonate of potash from the black residue
treated in the manner described, gave not the least indication
of silica.-(J. D. S.)
   Having observed that the black lining of the crucible was
precisely similar to the description given by Dr. Brown of
the films of silicon mentioned by him as lining the porcelain
crucible in which his experiment was made, and which pro
cess he recommends as likely “eventually to be an oeconomi
cal and convenient way of lining porcelain with silicon for
experimental purposes,” we were desirous of ascertaining
whether a cheaper and more easily to be obtained substance
containing carbon, could not be advantageously substituted
 for paracyanogen,                      so
                                 produce the desired object;
                                              as   to                                             we
therefore placed some lamp-black, mixed with         trace     per            a          of
oxide   of iron,        Berlin crucible, into which

rammed, and exposed this crucible, having previously put                                     to

   In page 235 Dr. Brown observes, that “before leaving the
production of silicon from uncombined paracyanogen, there
is another mode of operating to be mentioned, and it is equally
remarkable for simplicity and freedom from any intelligible
source of fallacy.”     “Triturate crude paracyanogen              all
excess of carbonate of potash, and fuse the mixture two hours
at a full white heat in a closed platinum crucible.          Paracy
anogen disappears; there is no free carbon in the white saline
product; but it yields a conformable proportion of silicic acid
when treated in the ordinary method of analysis for that com
pound.” “This process is more striking when subborate of
soda is substituted for potassa; for when the product is treated
with acids, there is no effervescence of carbonic acid; and
it must be remembered, once for all, that in every professed
                                                                          ...;
process of transformation, the disappearance of carbon has
to be accounted for as well as the new formation of silicon.”
Dr. Brown further states, that his crude paracyanogen con
tains “nearly a third of                  its
                                 own weight                   cyano  of

   As the two    processes  just quoted are strongly recommended
    Dr. Brown for their “simplicity and freedom from any                                          in

bear      directly upon the question        transformation                                   to
absolutely crucial experiments, we have followed the formula
detailed         by
              Dr. Brown with the greatest exactitude and care
in   the    following experiments:—
   Fifteen grs.     paracyanogen were mixed with 100 grs.
                           of                                                                     of

placed        closely covered platinum crucible, and this put
                in
                 a
into      earthen one, which was covered and carefully luted,
           an
was ignited        full yellow heat for two hours;

tassium, was found         have volatilized, cementing the cover
                                 to
to  the platinum crucible, and the residual salt was white;
this, treated with distilled water, gave      slightly opalescent so
                                                                 a
lution, which, when      small portion
                                 a       was treated with    mixture            a
    per- and protosulphate      iron and hydrochloric acid, gave
anof abundant precipitate                 of of
                                 Prussian blue;         the solution,     to

        on the alleged Conversion   of Carbon into Silicon.   299
hydrochloric acid was added in excess, which occasioned the
evolution of the characteristic odour of hydrocyanic acid; this
acid solution, evaporated to dryness, ignited to redness, and
treated with water, left a trace of reddish matter entirely so
luble in hydrochloric acid.—(J. D. S.)
    Five grs. of paracyanogen were then mixed with about 40
grs. of dried borax, and exposed to a white heat for full two
hours in a platinum crucible, covered and placed in a Hessian
luted crucible, as in the preceding experiment; when with
drawn, the Hessian crucible was completely glazed exteriorly,
and had evidently been softened by the heat; in the platinum
crucible there remained a glassy substance of a light sea-green
colour; this, treated with water, gave an alkaline solution, which
precipitated lime-water and ºffervesced with hydrochloric acid,
evaporated the acid solution to dryness and fused the re
sidue; again treated the residue with hydrochloric acid, and
 after evaporation to dryness, fused; the fused mass, treated
 with distilled water and hydrochloric acid, left a slight sedi
 ment; when this sediment was fused with carbonate of pot
 ash and the residue treated with hydrochloric acid, evaporated
 to dryness and ignited, the ignited chloride of potassium was
 wholly soluble, without any sediment whatever, in water aci
 dulated with hydrochloric acid; the solution contained traces
 of lime.—(J. D. S.)
    This experiment     was repeated upon rather a smaller scale,
 with  precisely  the same results.
    Notwithstanding the decisive nature of the experiments just
 detailed, we determined, in order to avoid every objection, to
 subject paracyanogen prepared from bicyanide of mercury—
 the paracyanogen employed by Dr. Brown—to the process
 indicated by him as simple and free from fallacy.        Some  bi
 cyanide of mercury was powdered and shaken down closel
 in a porcelain crucible, which was then covered and firmly
 luted; this was placed in another crucible, also covered and
 subjected to a full red heat for half an hour; the residue was
 black and coherent; a portion of this ignited left a trace of
 oxide of iron, and it was almost entirely soluble in sulphuric
 acid.
    Twenty grs. of this paracyanogen were mixed with 120 grs.
 of carbonate of potash and ignited for one hour and a half at
 a full yellow heat, the same precautions being taken as in the
 experiment before cited; when withdrawn, the residual salt
  was white, soluble in distilled water, gave with mixed per- and
  protosulphate of iron and hydrochloric acid a precipitate of
 Prussian blue, and evolved much hydrocyanic acid on the
 addition of hydrochloric acid, which occasioned no precipi

  tate: this acid solution, evaporated to dryness, ignited, and
  again treated with hydrochloric acid and water, left no per
  ceptible residue; whereas, from the statement of Dr. Brown
  (p. 236), if rightly understood by us, we ought to have ob
  tained at least 11 grs. of silicic acid from this quantity of
  paracyanogen.—(J. D. S.)
     We may here be allowed to remark, in explanation of the
  circumstance which seems to Dr. Brown so difficult to account
  for in the experiments just described, viz. “the disappearance
  of the carbon” of the paracyanogen when ignited with carbo
  nate of potash, that it is probable that one portion of the
  paracyanogen decomposes the carbonate of potash
                                                             .#

  carbonic oxide, mixed perhaps with carbonic acid, azote an
 potassium, and that the last-named substance combines with
 that portion of paracyanogen which is decomposed by heat
 into cyanogen, forming cyanide of potassium, a portion of
 which is               whilst, as we have seen, the remainder is
 found mixed with the excess of carbonate of potash used in the
 process: other explanations may be given, but this appears
 to us to be both the most feasible and the most in accordance
 with the facts we have noticed.                                    -
     Although the foregoing experiments were as direct and, to
 us, as decisive as we could desire respecting the alleged trans
 formation of carbon, we nevertheless determined to pursue
 the investigation further, so as to render it complete; we there
 fore turned our attention to the experiments of Dr. Brown
 (p. 236–7) on the formation of “compounds of silicon with
 copper, iron, and platinum, by the reaction of paracyanogen
                                 -
 on these metals.”
    Three grains of paracyanogen from decomposed prussic
acid were tightly wrapped up in platinum foil and placed in
a porcelain crucible, the bottom and sides of which were lined
with platinum foil, so as to prevent the foil containing the pa
racyanogen from coming in direct contact with the glazed
lining of the crucible; a cover was placed over the crucible, and
the whole imbedded in plaster of Paris paste contained in a
Hessian crucible; when dry, the apparatus was exposed to a
white heat for two hours.      The plaster of Paris had become
vitrified  by heat, and a   portion  of this vitrified matter found
entrance into the porcelain crucible; the latter, however, when
broken up, displayed the platinum of a brilliant colour, and of
softer texture than foil not previously exposed to so high a
temperature.     It could hardly therefore be supposed that the
platinum had been acted upon by silicon, which renders it
brittle, and does not render the metal more brilliant; it was
obviously useless to act upon the platinum by aqua regia for

          on the alleged Conversion                of Carbon into Silicon.          301
    the purpose of determining the quantity of silicon, if any, which
    it might contain, from the fact just noticed of vitrified matter
    having got accidentally into the crucible.—(R. H. B.)
       Twenty grains of precipitated copper were mixed with five
    grains of paracyanogen, and placed in a covered and luted
    porcelain crucible; this was placed in another crucible, also
    covered and carefully luted, and the apparatus exposed to a
    white heat for one hour and a half; when opened, the contents
    consisted of numerous metallic globules, mixed with a black
    powder; these globules were malleable, and wholly dissolved
    in nitric acid, whilst the black powder was consumed when
    ignited in contact with atmospheric air.—(J. D. S.)
       Another experiment was made by rolling up some verythin
    sheet-copper, so as to form a tube of considerable thickness,
    into which five grains of paracyanogen were tightly rammed,
    and each extremity of the tube secured by hammering; this was
    placed in an earthen crucible, covered and tightly luted, along
    with a platinum tube made of foil filled with paracyanogen, in
    the same way as the copper one above described, and exposed
    to a bright yellow heat for one hour and a half; when the cru
    cible was withdrawn and opened, the contents were found to be
    fused into a button, which was only slightly malleable, break
•        readily; having removed the exterior of this button, which
    .#
    adhered to the crucible, it was treated with nitric acid, which
    left a residue having the appearance of gray metallic particles
    mixed with black carbonaceous matter; by ignition with ac
    cess of air the black powder burnt away, leaving a gray residue
    entirely soluble in nitro-muriatic acid.—(J. D. S.)
        Having hitherto so completely failed in our endeavours to
    obtain results similar to those detailed by Dr. Brown in the
    paper under consideration, we resolved to conclude our expe
    rimental examination of            it,   by
                                         endeavouring      procure silicic
                                                                 to
    acid, either with         without the admixture of carbonate of
                             or

                                        potassium. These experiments
    are not so  satisfactory      as
                                 the preceding  ones, owing      the ener  to

with a black enamel, similar to the stain noticed in the former

     prussic acid was observed, and when the hydrochloric acid
     had been added to supersaturation, abundance of Prussian
     blue was formed; this was evaporated to dryness, and pure
    nitric acid added to the residue, the mixture transferred to a

nitric acid, the residuum was fused and then treated with hy
drochloric acid, which left a trace of insoluble matter, proba
bly silica, but which was so minute as not to affect a balance
sensible to rººm gr. ; this minute quantity was most probably
accidental, and very probably was derived from the iron tube
which was corroded.      The weight of the residual chlorides,
when evaporated to dryness, was 104 grs., so that if we admit
that only one-seventh of the quantities originally employed
were tested for silica, we should have above 20 grs, of ferro
cyanide of potassium submitted to this trial, which, according
to Dr. Brown (p. 245), should yield 3:6 grs. of silicic acid.—

   Subsequently to these experiments, it was observed in two
or three instances, that when paracyanogen made from the bi
cyanide of mercury was submitted to the blowpipe flame in
a tube of common flint-glass, closed at one end and drawn to
a capillary at the other, that gaseous matter was evolved, and
a small hole blown out at that end containing the paracyano
gen, through which aperture the gas escaped, and invariably
burnt with the characteristic flame of cyanogen.—(R. H. B.)
   This experiment was followed by placing, in a tube of Bohe
mian glass, having a bulb at one extremity, a small quantity
of paracyanogen, prepared by dissolving the dark-coloured
product which results from the spontaneous decomposition of
hydrocyanic acid in sulphuric acid, and precipitating by water,
well washing, and drying at a temperature of 260° to 300°Fahr.,
and plugging up the opening of the tube with plaster of Paris.
After causing the blowpipe flame to play upon the bulb con
taining the paracyanogen for a short time, a small hole was blown
out as before, and cyanogen continued to burn for some time.
   Some more paracyanogen, prepared in a similar manner, was
placed in a similar tube of Bohemian glass, but in this instance
the bulb was carefully coated with luting, the open extremity
plugged as before, and the apparatus carefully dried; the
flame of the blowpipe was then applied to the bulb for nearly
half an hour without any aperture being made in               When

Art. 1072 of his ‘Treatise on Light,' but which, in my opinion,
is unnecessarily tedious and prolix.
   Problem.—Required a curve PA, such that a line drawn

cooling, acid malate of lime crystallizes out in perfectly colour
less crystals.  It must be well washed with cold water, again
dissolved in boiling water, and precipitated by acetate of lead.
The lead salt is decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, and
the malic acid obtained pure by evaporation.
   Malic acid forms with bases two neutral salts, one of which
becomes anhydrous when dried at 100° C., while the other still
retains water at that temperature.         It possesses decided
bibasic properties, and the hitherto received atomic weight is
necessarily doubled.
  The following salts have been examined:—

    This salt is obtained by saturatinga solution of malic acid
with lime water. It is a crystalline powder, perfectly insoluble
in hot and cold water.
   0.489 gramme of this salt gave 0.319 sulphate of lime, or
32-188 per cent. lime.   This gives       the atomic weight            for                              of

many, which have hitherto been described, consist of teeth, a frag
ment of the skull, and a few broken vertebrae; and in the Warwick
sandstone of teeth only.     In this memoir, therefore, Mr. Owen
confines his attention to a comparison of the dental structure of the
Continental and English remains.     The teeth of the Labyrinthodon
Jaegeri (Mastodonsaurus Jaegeri, Meyer) of the Keuper are of a
simple, conical form, with numerous fine longitudinal striations;
and the teeth transmitted to Mr. Owen from the Warwick sandstone
by Dr. Lloyd, bear a very close resemblance to them. Their external
characters not being sufficient to establish either specific or generic
identity, Mr. Owen had sections prepared for microscopic examina
tion of portions of teeth of the Labyrinthodon Jaegeri forwarded to
him by Prof. Jäger, and of the English reptile; and though, from
his previous examination of the intimate texture of the teeth of the
Plesiosaur, Megalosaur, as well as of the Crocodile, Monitor, and
most recent Lacertians, he did not hope to detect such modifications
of structure as would obviously mark specific or even generic iden
tity, yet the slices exhibited such decided characters, and those of
the German fossils agreed so intimately with the sections obtained
from the Warwick specimen, that Mr. Owen was enabled not merely
to separate these fossils from                           of all
                                           known reptilian animals, but                                                to

   At the upper part of the tooth a thin layer of enamel”, besides a
coating of cement, is inflected at each groove towards the centre of

          Mr. Austin    on the Shores    of  Waterford Haven.        319
peat bed, raised but a few inches above the sea-level. On the eastern
side of Waterford Haven beds of similar shells occur at the same
level; also in the cliff north of Bluff Head, at the height of eight
feet. The greatest elevation at which the shelly beds have been ob
served by Mr. Austin in the county of Waterford, is forty feet.
    Immediately north of Newtown Head, at the point where a gradual
rise takes place in the cliff, the greater part of a human skeleton was
found resting on its back, five feet three inches below the surface,
 and about the same distance above high-water level, in the centre
 of the shelly bed. The Cardium edule was as numerous in and around
 the skeleton as in other portions of the bed, many of them being
lodged in the cavity of the skull. Mr. Austin carefully examined
the conditions under which the skeleton was found, and he is con
vinced that the ground had never been disturbed for sepulture, the
continuity of the shelly bed being unbroken where the skeleton oc
curred, and no specimens of the Cardium edule being dispersed at
random through the incumbent loam.            He is therefore of opinion,
that the   body  was washed into the    estuary during the period when
the  shelly bed was   accumulated;    that it was arrested at the point
where it has been found      by  the rise in the level of the bed; and
that  consequently   an elevation of the country has taken place since
the commencement of the human period.
    From an extended examination Mr. Austin is convinced, that the
estuary now limited to Waterford Haven formerly covered a much
larger area, as proved, in part, by the patches of shells noticed above;
and that the change of relative level has been slow and uniform,
producing no local disturbances; and he is further of opinion, that
the operation may be still in progress.
    Mr. Austin then gives a general description of the geological
structure of the two shores of Waterford Haven and of the adjacent
districts.   The formations consist of mountain-limestone, old red
sandstone, schistose strata, considered to be of the age of the Silu
rian system on account of the fossils found near Duncannon Fort
and Newtown Head, and trap rocks.
   The mountain-limestone constitutes Hook Point, the southernmost
headland of the Wexford side of the Haven.         It is succeeded to the
north, conformably, by a red or yellow sandstone, containing obscure
vegetable remains, also thin seams and nodules of anthracite, like
wise some small masses of black copper ore. These beds are assigned
by the author to the upper part of the old red sandstone. They are
succeeded in regular descending order by various marls, sandstones
and conglomerates, composing the mass of the formation, and esti
 mated to be 1600 feet thick.      A series of contorted and tilted slaty
 beds are then presented; but at Broom Hill the conglomerates of
 the old red sandstone reappear with the same dip towards the south.
 Immediately north of this promontory the slates recommence, and
are displayed in unconformable juxtaposition with the old red sand
 stone, the latter dipping southwards, and the former at a higher angle
 northwards.     From Broom Head to Arthurstown the slates consti
 tute the whole line of coast, except at Duncannon Fort. The strata

  320                       Geological Society.
 are, for the greater part, variously contorted; but near Arthurstown
 they dip 70° to the north, and are overlaid by beds of old red sand
 stone, which also dip to the north, but at an angle of only 30°. At
 Duncannon Fort an impure limestone occurs, containing Trilobites,
  corals and testacea, and considered by Mr. Austin to be analogous
 to species found in the Silurian system.
    On the opposite or Waterford side of the Haven the old red sand
 stone occurs at Creden Hill and Knockavelish Head, eminences cor
 responding to Broom Hill; a small patch of it is displayed a little
 to the northwards, inserted unconformably in the slate series; and
 it forms the rock of Passage, a prolongation of the old red sandstone
 near Arthurstown.        Between Knockavelish Head and Passage the
 slate series  prevails, except near Newtown Head, where trap-rocks
 are  exposed.   A little to the north of that headland are some highly
 inclined fossiliferous strata, corresponding in position to the beds
 near Duncannon Fort on the opposite side of the Haven; they are
 visible only at ebb-tide.
    The trap-rocks constitute the point on which stands Duncannon
 Fort; Newtown Head is also formed of trap; and Mr. Austin is of
 opinion that the same mass strikes westwards to Tramore and thence
 to Great Newtown Head, where it is lost in the St. George's Chan
 nel.     Along this line, wherever the trap comes to the surface, the
 slates are tilted.
    With respect to the numerous contortions exhibited in the sclaist
 ose rocks, Mr. Austin ascribes their existence to lateral pressure,
 which he says must have been excessive; and he is of opinion that
a considerable portion of the upper part of these contorted beds has
been removed by denudation.
    A paper by C. Lyell, Esq., F.G.S., was afterwards read, “On the
Freshwater      Fossil Fishes of Mundesley, as determined by M.
Agassiz.”
    In  a memoir on the boulder formation       and associated freshwater
deposits of Eastern Norfolk", Mr.         Lyell stated, on the authority of
Mr. Yarrell and the Rev. L. Jenyns, that the scales and teeth of fishes
which had been then procured in the fluviatile beds of Mundesley
belonged to the Esoa lucius, to a trout or an undeterminable species
of Salmo, to a carp, probably the Cyprinus carpio, and to a distinct
species of Perca.
    This collection, with some additions recently sent to the author
by Mr. Wigham, was examined by M. Agassiz during his late visit
to England. The decision of Mr. Jenyns with respect to the distinct
ness of the perch, M. Agassiz fully confirmed; but he was of opinion
that the pike differs from the Esor lucius, and that the supposed carp
is a species of Leuciscus; and that the trout is not truly a trout, al
though one of the same great family.
    From this examination, therefore, Mr. Lyell says it is apparent that
these remains belong to species not identical with any European

    freshwater fishes hitherto described; but that they nevertheless be
    long to an ichthyological fauna, more modern and more nearly re
    sembling the recent than any other with which M. Agassiz is ac
    quainted in a fossil state.
        Similar remains have been found by Mr. Lyell at Runton, near
     Cromer, but both there and at Mundesley the associated testacea all
     belong to living freshwater species; even the Paludina minuta (Strick
     land), which Mr. Morris has pointed out to the author to be iden
     tical with the P. marginata of Michaud, a living French species.
     It is a question therefore, the author states, whether these unknown
     fishes may not still inhabit the rivers and lakes of the more northern
     parts of Europe or America, especially as M. Agassiz is at present
     unacquainted with the freshwater fishes of Norway, Sweden, Spitz
     bergen, Iceland, Greenland, Labrador and Canada, and even of the
     northernmost parts of Scotland and the Shetland Islands; and in
     conclusion Mr. Lyell says, it seems natural to look northward for
     types analogous to the Mundesley fishes, because the beds in which
     they occur were deposited contemporaneously with the drift accu
     mulated by the agency of floating ice.
         Feb. 3.—A paper was read, “On the Geological Structure of the
     Wealden District, and of the Bas Boulonnais,” by William Hopkins,
     Esq., F.G.S.
         This paper is divided into two parts. In the first the author de
     scribes the phaenomena of elevation presented in the two districts
     comprised      respectively within the boundary of the great Chalk
     escarpment of the south-eastern part of England, and an exactly simi
     lar escarpment forming the inland boundary of the Bas Boulonnais.
     The former is well known as extending from the coast at Folkstone,
     by Seven Oaks, Godstone, Farnham, Petersfield, &c., round to the
     coast again at Beachy Head.           On the opposite side of the channel,
     the escarpment, commencing at Wisant on the north, forms nearly
     a semicircle, of which Boulogne is not far from the centre.               If we
     conceive the northern Weald escarpment continued from Folkstone
    to Wisant, and the southern one from Beachy Head to the southern
    extremity of the Bas Boulonnais, it will be seen that the whole tract
    comprised within the Chalk would be a regular oval, except that                                           its
    axis instead       being straight
                           of               curved,      is               so   as

 line of flexure, with a great dip to the north, but without the cor
 responding dip to the south necessary to form an anticlinal arrange
ment, except in one or two localities.            Towards the west it runs
 immediately at the foot of the Hog's Back with a dip, which, near its
western extremity, amounts to 70 or 80 degrees.                Near Guildford
it  passes   by  the foot of the hill on which     Margaret's    chapel stands.
To the east it passes south of Dorking and Reigate to the summit of
Tilburstow Hill. It is afterwards continued by Limpsfield to the east
of Seven Oaks, as formerly described by Dr. Fitton.             At some points
between these last-mentioned        places,  the line assumes a distinct an
ticlinal character.
    Transverse valleys exist in the greensand ridge of this part of the
district as well as in that on the southern side. The author also
alludes to what he conceives to be incipient valleys of this descrip
tion, and states his reasons for believing them to be indications of
transverse fractures.       He conceives this opinion to be strongly cor
roborated     by  the existence of the perennial springs by which these
valleys are characterized. Several are pointed out, especially in Leith
 Hill and the Seven Oaks ridge overlooking the valley of the Weald.
    Transverse river-courses through the Chalk escarpment form one of
the most striking features in the geology of this district.          The ana
logy which they bear to the transverse valleys across the greensand
ridges would seem to leave no doubt of their being referable to the
same physical cause; and as there are in many instances direct evi
dence which renders the origin of these latter valleys in transverse
fractures highly probable, the same conclusion appears almost equally
probable with respect to the river-courses through the Chalk.                In
the evidence of dislocation which the Chalk itself affords, there is
nothing, however, very conclusive; but it must be remembered, that
the evidence of faults is always difficult to detect in a massive forma
tion like the Chalk, possessing not more than two general divisions
which admit of distinct identification.
    The central chalk ridge of the Isle of Wight is traversed in like
manner by three transverse valleys, two of which are river-courses.
The author has pointed out some direct evidence in support of the

the  elevatory force. It is not, however,  to be regarded as a neces
sary consequence of this conclusion, that the whole elevation of the
district was thus produced at once; it might be in some degree pro
duced by previous, and in a considerable degree by subsequent
movements; but it would seem at least highly probable, that that
general movement which produced the dislocations of the elevated

   Colonel Everest resolved to construct the new tables and azimuth
circles of cast-iron, which, though objectionable on account of its
liability to rust, has the advantage of being lighter and less yielding
than brass. The circles were inlaid with gold to receive the gra
duations; and at every tenth degree a circular disc of silver was let
in, so that the large figures might stand prominent.           Each was sup
plied with a strong edge-bar below, which put

   The table of galvanometric deflections is suspended in the labora
tory of the London Institution. Professor Grove furnished Mr. Walker
with a copy for the Society; it contains the deflections for twenty
four arrangements.     The negative element, also a suggestion of
Mr. Grove's, is platinized silver gauze for Smee's battery; he has
found the advantage from using cuprized copper, and has only
delayed adopting the silver from the difficulty of obtaining such

an article.   The Secretary recommended platinized, plated-copper

“On   the Mode of treating Copper Ores, and the Ores of other
Metals combined with Sulphur, so as to ascertain the quantity of
Sulphur in such Ores, and also the quantity of Copper in the native
 Sulphuret.”
    A quantity of the powdered ore, sulphuret of copper, about 50 or
 100 grains, is placed in a porcelain tube traversing a small furnace,
 and made red-hot; after remaining for 5 or 6 minutes a portion of the
 sulphur will be expelled; a stream of oxygen gas is then passed over
 it,  the remaining sulphur              then rapidly given off
                                               is                      sulphurous and          as
 sulphuric acids, and the copper thoroughly oxidized. By heating the
 ore when first introduced into the tube                 becomes slightly adherent,
                                                                         it
 which prevents any                 from being blown away by the oxygen gas.

 The contents             of

     understood, the destruction of the boiler.    On the surface which
was next to the     copper   it is coated by dioxide of copper, and the
mass  appears  made   up of an  aggregation of prismatic crystals, whose
axes are    perpendicular   to the surface on which the incrustation
formed : under a microscope these crystals appear to be six-sided
prisms.    I compared, under a polarizing microscope, portions of the
powder of Iceland spar, and of arragonite from Bilin, with the pow
der of the specimen; the latter agreed very closely in appearance
with that of arragonite.
   “Among the powder of the specimen were seen some very acute
double six-sided pyramids; these with little doubt are similar to
those formed by G. Rose" by evaporating solutions of carbonate of
lime at a boiling heat, and described by him as resembling some
sapphire crystals.

sisted chiefly of carbonate of lime; water, however, dissolved from it

there can be little doubt but that the specimen affords an example
of the formation of arragonite, and a verification of G. Rose's expe
riments.                                                          -
    “I  have since made two attempts at producing arragonite by Rose's
 method of precipitation, but cannot boast of my success.        The fol
 lowing is a note of the best experiment.       A solution of 300 grains
 of chloride of calcium, in 4 ounces of water at 212°, was mixed ra
pidly with a solution of 330 grains of carbonate of ammonia in 8
 ounces of water at 180°. The mixed liquor was not alkaline.
    “The precipitate under the microscope consisted chiefly of radiating
 spicular crystals, extremely minute, with occasional rhombohedrons.
 The precipitate being washed, the specific gravity taken before dry
 ing came out = 2.751, after drying it was below 27. During the
 washing a slight crackling noise was heard, and I cannot help think
 ing the precipitate may have been thrown down as arragonite, but
 changed into calc-spar during the washing and drying.”
    Professor Kuhlman of Lille presented specimens of Chalk hard
 ened by his process for the Silicification of Limestones, which con
 sists of immersing them in a solution of silicate of potash, expos
 ing to air for several days, and afterwards washing. Although the
 chalk did not contain more than three or four per cent. of silica,
 it was capable of scratching many cements and marbles. In a
 similar manner he could harden carbonate of lead and plaster of
 Paris. He finds alkaline salts in all the limestones containing silica,
 which are hydraulic, and believes that they originally resembled
 ordinary chalk in purity, but have been partially silicified by infil
 tration of water containing an alkaline silicate in solution, or by a
 natural process analogous to his artificial one.
    Extract of a letter from Dr. R. F. Marchand of Berlin, “On the
 Atomic Weight of Carbon.”
    “I   take this opportunity of communicating the results of experi
 ments relative to the atomic weight of carbon, which Professor Erd
 man and myself have very lately obtained.        The difference between
 the numbers recently given by Dumas and that of Berzelius was a
 sufficient inducement for us to examine and repeat Dumas's experi
 ments, much occupied as we are with organic analysis. The burn
 ing of diamonds in oxygen gas was easily effected by us in a porce
 lain tube, by a pretty high temperature.      The apparatus employed
 was very similar to that described by Dumas.
    “The following are the results:—
 No. 1. 0-8062 gramme diamonds left a residue weighing 0-0010
       gramme, and gave 2-9467 grs. carbonic acid, consequently
       giving the atomic weight for carbon 75-19.
No. 2. 1-0867 gr. left a residue weighing 0.0009 gr., and gave
       3.9875 grs. carbonic acid = carbon 74-84.
No. 3. 1.3575 gr. left a residue weighing 0-0018 gr., and gave
       4-9659 grs. carbonic acid = carbon 75' 10.

No. 5. 0.7510 gr. left a residue weighing 0-0010, and gave 2:7490
       =    carbon 75:03.
   “Graphite gave the same numbers: the residues were pure white
silex without a trace of oxide of iron                           :-
No.    1. 14580 gramme native graphite left a residue weighing
       0.0075, and gave 5-31575 grs. = carbon 75:05 atomic weight.

       5:6377 grs. = carbon 75.02.

       grs. ==carbon 75' 10.
   “The mean of these experiments give 75.07; we therefore consider
75 as the true number indicated by these experiments for the atomic
weight of carbon.     It is remarkable that this number was fixed upon
theoretically by the English chemists, and has now been confirmed
by experiments. If we take the number 6.239 for hydrogen, with a
very small increase, viz. as G-250, we arrive at the numbers for oxy
gen, carbon and hydrogen, viz. 16, 12, 2, or 8, 6, 1.”

the lactate of lime formed immediately crystallizes in perfectly white
mammillated masses, and from this the lactic acid is procured by the
well-known      processes.
   It is evident, observe the authors, that lactic acid may be satu
rated by other bases, and they state that a chemical manufacturer
has prepared this acid from the sour water of starch-makers, by satu
rating it with carbonate of lime.—Journal de Pharmacie, xxvii. 341.
                      PREPARATION OF FORMIC AETHER.
     According to Wöhler, the following    process yields formic aether
in large  quantity, and   very readily : put into a retort ten parts of
starch and 37   parts of  peroxide of  manganese,  intimately mixed in
very fine powder; add to them a mixture of 30 parts of sulphuric
acid, 15 parts of highly rectified spirit of wine, and 15 parts of
water; the mixture is to be gently boiled, and distillation continued
until the product contains no aether. In order to separate the water
and the alcohol, a sufficient quantity of chloride of calcium is to be
dissolved in the product, and distillation is to be performed in a
water-bath; the purification is to be completed by a second rectifi
cation in the same manner.
   M. Wöhler states, that in the numerous experiments which M.
Kolbe made on this subject at his request, appearances presented
themselves which probably indicate the presence of a peculiar sub
stance in this aether, requiring fresh experiments for elucidation:
when the fragments of fused chloride of calcium have been for some
time in contact with the aether which has been once rectified, and
are partly dissolved, it becomes of a deepish yellow colour, and de
posits small, very fine colourless crystals on the sides of the vessel.
In general the colour disappears after a certain time; it is probably
owing to chloride of iron; and probably also the crystals are a com
pound of chloride of calcium and alcohol, which are soluble in formic
aether, and may crystallize from it.—Journal de Pharmacie, tom. xxvii.

chlorine is disengaged, and there remains chloride of iodine, which
gives a precipitate of iodine with carbonate of potash.
   According to M. Mellon, the formation of chloride of iodine ex
plains the reaction that occurs: the iodine attracts the chlorine of
the chlorate, whilst the greater affinity of the iodine for the oxygen,
and the greater cohesion of the iodate, cause the iodine to enter into
the chlorate instead of the chlorine.    The action M. Mellon repre
sents thus: 5 CIO’, KO + 61 = 5 I O5, KO + I C I*.

elements from   plants  themselves.
   We have, indeed, ascertained, from the most satisfactory
results, that animals do not create true organic matters, but
that they destroy them; that plants,        the contrary, habitu     on
ally create these same matters, and that they destroy but few

animal matters are formed, and they are there produced at the
cost of the air:
   From vegetables, these matters pass ready-formed into the
herbivorous animals, which destroy a portion of them, and
accumulate the remainder in their tissues:
   From herbivorous animals, they pass ready-formed into
the carnivorous animals, who destroy or retain some of them
according to their wants:
   Lastly, during the life of these animals, or after their death,
these organic matters, as they are destroyed, return to the at
mosphere whence they proceeded.
   Thus closes this mysterious circle of organic life at the sur
face of the globe. The air contains or engenders oxidized pro
ducts, as carbonic acid, water, nitric acid, oxide of ammo
nium.     Plants, constituting true reducing apparatus, possess
themselves of their radicals, carbon, hydrogen, azote, ammo
nium.     With these radicals they form           the organic            all                         or
organizable matters which they yield             animals. These,    to

which return       the air
                       to      produce anew and through endless

 themselves almost always derived from the action of the great

a momentary existence in the air because of their solubility in
Water.
        The air, then, is constituted of a mixture of oxygen, azote,
carbonic acid, and marsh gas.
   The carbonic acid in it varies, and indeed greatly, since
the differences in it extend almost from the simple to the
double, from 4 to 6–10,000ths.           May not this be a proof that
plants take from the air this carbonic acid, and that animals
take back a part from it? in a word, may this not be a proof
of that equilibrium of the elements of the air attributed to the
inverse actions which animals and plants produce upon it?
   It has, indeed, been long since remarked; animals borrow
from the air              its
                    oxygen, and give            carbonic acid; plants,

proaching the influence of animals who introduce this acid
into the air, and that of vegetables, which deprive it of it?
    No; this phaenomenon, you are aware, is a simple meteor
ological phaenomenon. It is with carbonic acid as with aque
ous vapour, which forms on the surface of the sea, to become
condensed elsewhere, fall again in rain, and be reproduced
under the form of vapour.
    This water, which is condensed and falls, dissolves, and
carries with it carbonic acid; this water, which evaporates,
yields up this same gas to the air.
    A great meteorological interest would attach to the observa
tion of the variations of the hygrometer, and those of the sea
sons, or of the state of the sky with the variations of the car
bonic acid of the air; but hitherto all tends to show that these
rapid variations constitute a simple meteorological event, and
not, as had been thought, a physiological event, which, singly
considered, would infallibly produce variations infinitely slower
than those which are, in fact, observed as much in towns as
in the country itself.
    Thus the air is an immense reservoir, whence plants may for
a  long time derive                     all
                          the carbonic acid necessary for their
wants; where animals, during        much longer time still, will

348       Miss Zornlin on the Periodical Shooting Stars.
have not been witnessed in the same splendour as in other
lands possessing a clearer atmosphere, and perhaps a more
excessive climate. Phaenomena of no small degree of interest,
have, however, not unfrequently been exhibited in this country;
these, in some cases, not being the less important, from the
 evidence they afford that the periodical shooting stars cannot
 be regarded as an isolated meteorological phaenomenon.
    The most remarkable display of the November shooting
 stars of which I have met with any record, as occurring in
 Britain, took place in 1832; and as I believe that the phae
 nomena here referred to have not hitherto been brought for
 ward as connected with the periodical shooting stars, it may
 not be uninteresting to insert some notice of them in this
 place.    Nor are these accounts less worthy of notice, from
 the circumstance of their having been recorded before public
 attention had been directed to the probable periodicity of the
 phaenomenon, by the grand display of 1833. A paper was
 read before the Royal Society on the 13th of December, 1832,
 entitled “An Account of an extraordinary Meteor seen at
 Malvern, November 12, 1832, by W. Addison, Esq., F.L.S.,
 “in which the author states that he beheld, from the Malvern
 Hills, a constant succession of meteors, of various degrees of
 magnitude and brilliancy. The smaller ones were like those
 commonly called shooting stars; others were much more
 brilliant; and notwithstanding the bright moonshine, threw
 a strong glare upon every object: they also left behind them
 a long train of very vivid white light.      The author witnessed
 this scene for upwards of an hour, and it was still going on
                             At
                                              of he

 don Literary Gazette              of
                             the same year, we find the following
 account:—“It appears from the provincial newspapers,                                               in
 various parts          of
                       the country, that very remarkable phae
nomena were       seen,  both north and south,         the morning        on
 of Tuesday week [November 13th]... Fiery meteors and fall
ing stars (as they are called) issued from the west, and                                          il
luminated the heavens         their course, leaving behind them
                                   in

was also witnessed, at the same time, in considerable splen
dour, at Geneva, and in other parts of l'urope; at Oren
burg, and in Arabia.
    The November periodical shooting stars have likewise, as
is well known, been observed in later years in this country,
though in smaller numbers; but what is more to my present
purpose, on some occasions, whilst a brilliant display of these
meteors has been witnessed in other parts of the globe, me
teoric phaenomena of different character have been observed
in this island.       Thus, on the evening of November 12, 1837,
a fine coloured       aurora,   accompanied by some shooting stars,
was observed at this place, as well as in many other parts of
Britain *; and on the morning of the 13th of November, 1838,
I  witnessed meteoric placnomena of the grandest description,
consisting of three successive and distinct splendid auroras,
exhibiting well-defined arches, as also streamers and patches
of the most vivid red and green hues. This magnificent dis
play was accompanied by a small number of shooting starst.
 Auroras, and other similar meteoric phaenomena, are also on
 record as having occurred in various years on the 12th and
 13th of November in other parts of the globe.                 Thus, on the
 13th of November, 1832, when, as already mentioned, shooting
 stars were observed in great splendour in this country, as also
 at Geneva, in Arabia, and at Orenburg, remarkable meteoric
 phaenomena,        consisting of brilliant luminous columns and
 bands, were witnessed both to the north and south of the latter
 place; and on the 13th of November, 1836, an aurora was ob
 served at New York, and other places in the United States. Nor
 does the occurrence of these periodical meteoric phaenomena
 appear to be confined to very recent times; for we find it re
 corded, that on November 18, 1755, “The sky was red, and
 red rain fell in different countries.”         And again, on the 14th
 of November, 1765, “Red rain fell in Picardy f.” Nay, the
 collection of facts from which the above accounts are taken,
 enables us to trace the occurrence of apparently similar phae
 nomena to a much earlier era; it being recorded that on the
 5th or 6th of November, 472, there was “a great fall of black
 dust, probably at Constantinople, during which the heavens

 Number for January 1838. [Third Series, vol. xii. p. 85.]
   t   For a notice of the phaenomena exhibited on this occasion, I would
refer te a paper in the Phil. Mag. for Jan. 1839, [S. 3. vol. xiv. p. 39.] by
 Mr. W. R. Birt, with whose observations my own, as far as they were
 carried, closely correspond; though no description could convey an ade
 quate idea  of the  splendour of the phaenomena.

seemed to burn.”     The latter date, allowing for the difference
of style in that age, would form a close approximation to the
 present 12th or 13th day of the month.
     Similar in character to the November shooting stars, are
 those of August; and, like the former, they also are accom
 panied by other meteoric phaenomena.             Thus, on both occa
 sions, lightning has frequently been noticed; and luminous ap
pearances in the clouds were observed by myself on the night
of August 11, 1839 *, much resembling those noticed by M.
 Wartmann at Geneva, on the night of November 12, 1836+.
 And in the Sixth Report of the British Association for the
 Advancement of Science, we meet with an account, commu
 nicated by Dr. Traill, of a splendid aurora borealis, which
 was observed on August 11, 1836. A very remarkable                                                              in
 stance of the August periodical meteors, which is mentioned
 in Colonel Reid's work “On the Law of Storms,” may be
 worth citing in this place<U+017F>.        The phaenomenon occurred du
ring the hurricane at Barbadoes in 1831, and the relation is
given in an extract from an account published at Bridgetown
in that island, immediately after it occurred. The hurricane
had been raging in                 all       its
                                    fury, accompanied          incessant                       by

             Miss Zornlin on the Periodical Shooting Stars.
      would be easy to multiply instances of the periodical re-
turn both of the                and August shooting stars, but
the periodicity of these meteors I consider as granted; and,
with the exception of two remarkable instances, neither of
                                                                                              351

which        I
           believe has appeared in any published catalogue,
and which I have therefore been induced to insert, my object
has been solely to bring forward facts in support of the opi
                                              .
nion that the display of the periodical shooting stars cannot
be regarded as an isolated meteorological phaenomenon.
   The nature and origin of the periodical, and indeed of all
other shooting stars, appears       to be involved in much ob
scurity.    From the   above, and similar facts, it may, however,
be  inferred,  that they are connected with other meteorologi
cal phaenomena—phaenomena which apparently originate in
electricity, and which may be considered as atmospheric.
We shall therefore be led to                       seek   for their origin in our
own atmosphere, and shall not surely be wandering from the
mark, if to electricity we refer the production of these, and

                                    of of
perhaps of     meteors      similar character.
   The visible effects      electricity (whether voltaic       or                        or
dinary) are, according        Mr. Faraday, “the evolution
                                        to                                                         of
heat, the production            of
                           magnetism, chemical decomposition,
physiological changes, and lastly, the evolution        light,                     of              in

“a  ball of fire was observed to be precipitated into the sea;”
and Colonel Reid mentions that “many of the descriptions of
these whirlwinds speak of visible flame attending them, and
occasionally of a remarkable noise.”     If we suppose the por
tion of ignited matter to consist solely of oxygen and hydro
gen, the result would be pure water; and, when formed in
elevated strata of the atmosphere, no trace evident to our
senses might remain (unless, indeed, when these meteors
should occur in vast numbers, in which case the light re
flected by the newly-formed water or vapour, might present
the appearance of luminous bands): but if such an ignition
and explosion were to take place in lower strata, it might give
rise to the showers of rain which fall so suddenly in water
spouts. The atmosphere, however, contains a large propor

must use the term periodicity, as applied to these meteors,
with caution*.” That philosopher, however, does not seem
to regard the aurora borealis as connected with, and occa
sionally appearing as a substitute for the phaenomena of the
shooting stars; the fact, however, is attested by his own ob
servations in 1837, and by those of others in 1838.       He
further remarks, that no marked indication was observed in
1839 and 1840. At this place, in both those years, the nights
of November 12th were most unfavourable for observation;
that of November 12th, 1839, having been uniformly foggy;
and that of November 12th, 1840, hazy and dull in the early
part of the evening, and subsequently rainy. In 1836, the
weather at this epoch was not more propitious; and in 1837,
except in the early part of the evening (when the phaenome
non before described was witnessed), the sky was overcast
throughout the night, the moon being also at the full. On
the 10th of August of the present year (1841) we had here a
dull evening and a rainy night: on the 9th, however, the
phaenomenon of shooting stars was witnessed in far more than
usual abundance; and among those I observed, although the
larger proportion were direct, or moving from N.E. to S.W.,
three were retrograde, or moving from S.W. to N.E.; and the
latter included a splendid meteor, much larger than Venus,
<U+017F>º
which burst into sparks.
   The predominating direction of these meteors is another
  oint to which, perhaps, some allusion ought to be made. The
           of Chladni, and that which has been most gene
rally adopted, consists, as stated by Mr. Galloway, “in sup
posing that, independently of the great planets, there exist in
the planetary regions myriads of small bodies which circulate
about the sun, generally in groups or zones, and that one of
these zones intersects the ecliptic about the place through
which the earth passes in November.”           Besides other dif
ficulties attending this hypothesis, (none of which, it will be
found, apply to the hints at explanation I have offered above,)
Mr. Galloway remarks, “That bodies moving in groups in
the circumstances supposed, must necessarily move in the
same direction, and consequently, when they become visible
from the earth, would        all
                              appear     emanate from one point
                                           to
and move towards the     opposite.    Now, although the observa
tions seem      show that the    predominating   direction    from
              to to
                                                                  is
north-east     south-west, yet shooting stars are observed              on
the same nights       to
                    emanate from        all
                                       points       of
                                                  the heavens, and
to move  in   all
                possible directions.”   This  difficulty,   will it      be

Philosophical Magazine.
   The analysis of gases, and more especially their combina
tion or mixture in atmospheric air, being attended with no
small difficulty of manipulation, (nor are the precautions re
quisite for obtaining accurate results of no mean consequence)
it may be desirable to premise with a few observations on the
different points of consideration so necessary for this purpose,
and which are fully detailed in the essays themselves.
  A due correction was made in              the following experi

the gas being afterwards passed through a solution of chlorate
of lime. The nitrous gas or deutoxide of nitrogen was pro
cured by the action of nitric acid in pure metallic copper,
collecting the gas sometimes over water, and sometimes over
mercury.
   The quadrisulphuret of lime was manufactured after the
manner recommended by Dr. Dalton.
   The samples of air taken from the different loads in the
mines were procured by emptying jars of water of their con
tents, and four-ounce bottles of mercury from one to the other,
at the required spots, preserving a small portion of the water
or mercury, greasing the corks, driving them as tight as pos
sible, and afterwards sealing them over. Both jars and bottles
were kept in an inverted position from this moment to that
of their use; and a further proof of their security was ge
nerally had by an escape of a few bubbles of air on withdraw
ing the cork or stopper under water in the pneumatic trough.
    The pneumatic trough was filled with perfectly clean rain
water, collected from the glass roof of a green-house, and
renewed as frequently as opportunities would permit.

 LI.  Remark on Primitive Radices. By the Rev. R. Munphy#.
               had the honour of receiving from M. Jacobi his
 HAYING‘Canon   Arithmeticus, sive tabulae, quibus exhibentur
 pro singulis numeris primis, vel primorum potestatibus infra
 1000, numeriad datos indices et indices ad datos numeros per
tinentes, Berolini, 1839,' I sought in the tables for some law
relative to primitive radices.   Being desirous of completing a
 work, entitled ‘New Forms for the calculation of Logarithms,”
which is nearly ready for the press, I could not bestow suf
ficient time to investigate the absolute generality of the fol
lowing properties; yet even as empiric forms easily recollected,
and verified in every case in those tables, and also in every
case where I have taken small primitive radices, they will be
found useful; at the same time the attention of mathematicians
will, I hope, be drawn to the demonstration of the generality of
these forms (or the contrary), though belonging to what is usu
ally considered a dry subject, “The Theory of Numbers.”
   In page 6, we find a table, “Numeri primi, quorum 10
radix primitiva est,” viz. 7, 17, 19, 23, 29, 47, 59, &c. to
2543; and the table from which this is deduced is (with some
exceptions) carried as far as 9901. The following prime
numbers, to which 10 is primitive radix, may be culled from
those in Burckhardt's table, viz. 7, 17, 47, 97, 167, 257, 367
(497 is not prime), 647 (817 is not prime), (1007 is not
prime), 1217, 1447, 1697 (1967 is not prime).        Hence every
prime number of the form 10 n° 4-7 has 10 for a primitive
radix, as far as can be verified by these tables.
   As this property, if general, must depend on some relation
between the numbers 7 and 10, I remarked that 7 was the only
prime number less than 10, to which the latter was the pri
mitive radix; accordingly, I tried in several instances the
more general formula an” +p, where p is a prime number less
than a number, a to which a is a primitive radix (as 3 n° + 2,
5 n” + 3, &c.); from the results it would appear to be a
general property, that under those circumstances a n” -- p
         prime, and p greater than         will have a as a  pri
(when                                 %)
mitive radix.    From the cause I have mentioned, I have not
bestowed that attention to these properties        I  could have
wished; the attention of others will now be called to them;
in the mean time they may stand as empiric formulae.

ject which have been pursued by several mathematicians, and
especially by     M. Cauchy, so far   as they have come to my
knowledge; so various, however, are the channels through
which such researches are made public, that some of them,
 especially those which appear on the Continent, often escape
attention.     In this way I now find I have omitted to notice
 some of the later investigations of the distinguished mathema
 tician just named.
     M. Cauchy has favoured me with a letter, in which, ac
 knowledging the receipt of a copy of my work, he adds a
 brief mention of these later investigations, to which I had not
                                   rºl:
 referred in my volume, with a request that I would take an
 opportunity of supplying my               with this further  in
 formation. As it may be some time before a work on abstract
 science reaches a second edition, perhaps the best course      I
 can pursue is to offer a very brief statement of the points in
 question through the medium of this Journal.
     It appears then, that subsequently to the researches of
 which    I have given abstracts, M. Cauchy published in August
  1836, at Budweiss, a lithographed memoir entitled Mémoire
 sur la Théorie de la Lumière, &c., which bears much on the
  subject of the general theory, and the phaenomena to which
  it relates, as considered in my tract.
     The main heads of this investigation are as follows:—
     1. The general equations of motion of the aether: 2nd. Co
  lour, or the dispersion: 3rd. The motion of light penetrating
  to a small depth into the interior of opake bodies: 4th. The
  transition from the formulae obtained under the third head, to
  those which represent vibratory motion in general in an
  aethereal fluid : 5th and 6th. The case of media in which the
  propagation of light takes place in the same manner in every
  direction, whether round any point, or round every axis
  parallel to a given straight line: 7th. The propagation of
  plane waves in transparent bodies.
     The consequences have been further followed out by the
  author in other memoirs published since.
     In the second volume of the Comptes Rendus, 1836 (1st
  semestre), p. 365, M. Cauchy has observed that the intensity
  of the light penetrating to a small depth a in the interior of
  an opake body, decreases in proportion to a negative expo
  mential of the form e-cº.
     Exponentials of the same kind are found entering into
  many of the formulae included in the memoir of August 1836;
  and setting out from these formulae, he shows (p. 84 of that
  memoir) how in a coloured glass the thickness necessary to
  produce the extinction of a luminous ray may vary with the
  nature of the colour.

   Among the formulae of § 7, we may distinguish the equa
tions (44.) (9.) and (51.), from which follow (as the author
observes, p. 95) the laws of rectilinear, circular and elliptic
polarization; and it may be remarked that the equation (9.),
relative to a transparent medium, viz.

which               to accord with some results arrived at by
              appears
Ohm, which I have subsequently seen; though he has not
deduced formulae of quite the same nature.
   These formulae are useful to solve many practical questions,
such for instance as relating to the size of conducting wires,
and power of batteries necessary to transmit a given quantity of
electricity through a given distance, as in telegraphs; and in
determining the ratio of the section to the length of helix
wires in forming electro-magnets of various dimensions and
proportions, so as to obtain a maximum of effect, which de
pends chiefly on the number of coils x the quantity of elec
tricity in circulation.
   The constant 580 in the formulae applies only to copper
wire unannealed; to adapt the formulae to different metals
we must vary the constant in the direct ratio of their con
ducting powers. The above calculations and experiments
refer only to electricity of the intensity of a single cell of
Daniell's constant battery. It is probable (judging from an
experiment with electricity of two cells' intensity) that an                           in
crease in the intensity has the same effect on the transmission
 of the electricity, as a proportionate increase in the conduct
ing power of the wire, as Ohm had previously deduced.
    The ordinary form of galvanometer, by the deflection of the
needle in a helix placed so as to be in the magnetic meridian,
cannot determine the comparative amounts of two currents
of electricity by any calculation from the degrees of deflec
tion, unless previous data be obtained by other experiments,
as the amount of deflective force exerted by any given cur
rent at different arcs of deflection (when balanced by ter

    But the loss was only temporary, as they recovered their
former power immediately that they were separated. . [Their

they are in actual contact.]

 But it is very trying to have two-thirds of the magnetic power
 temporarily suppressed by mutual proximity, and they would
 probably soon lose permanently a portion of it by any slight
 concussion.
    The experiments were gone over three times, and the mean
 results taken.   The magnets were placed at their closest di
 stance before   beginning,  so that further permanent loss of
 magnetism might not take place during the experiments.         I
 believe the third place of decimals in the first table cannot be
 trusted.
    From the foregoing table and observation following, it ap
 pears that power is not gained by too great an approximation
 of plates of a compound magnet, and the thinner the plates
 the better.

              years since a paper by M. Mossotti, on the forces
 SOME
   which          regulate the internal constitution of bodies, at
 tracted a     good     deal of attention among scientific men. A
 translation of it appeared in the third part of the “Scientific
  Memoirs.’        The author's object was to develope the views of
  Franklin and AEpinus with respect to electricity.                  It is well.
 known, that in the form which the latter of these philosophers
 gave to the single fluid hypothesis, a mutual repulsion is sup
 posed to exist among the material molecules of which bodies
 are composed, as well as among the particles of the electrical
 aether; while these particles are supposed to be attracted by
 the material molecules. Assuming that                    the forces required     all
  by      hypothesis       vary  directly        the mass and inversely                                                   as

 equilibrium among the molecules                     which bodies are comof
 posed      ?This        the question which M. Mossotti proposed
                              is                                                                                          to
 determine.
    A   priori, stable equilibrium certainly appears                      possi                    to      be
 ble; for,        the author remarks,                               matter sur                    of

 together, there must                      be a

equilibrium.         But    although    M. Mossotti's      general   view may
 be  correct,       believe

LVIII.     Some Observations on Dr. Brett and Mr. Smith's
   Experiments on the alleged Conversion of Carbon into                                                       Si
   licon *. By Dr. SAMUEL M. Brown.
                               To Richard Phillips, Esq.
     SIR,
    S Dr. Brett and Mr. Smith have made the Philosophical
     Magazine the medium of publication for their “Experi
ments on the alleged Conversion of Carbon into Silicon,” I re
quest you to do me the honour of giving the same publicity to
these few and brief observations on their letter, while I gladly
acknowledge the liberal style of investigation in                       the                         iii.
gentlemen in question have undertaken and executed their
task.
    Your Correspondents specify, on the very threshhold, that
the “paracyanogen employed by them was produced by the
decomposition of hydrocyanic acid;” and this is sufficient to
render almost            all
                      their experiments            value.          not,
                                                                     If of it no              I     do         in
deed, understand the statement.                        meant that their            be
paracyanogen was prepared                              by
                                       the spontaneous decomposition
of   anhydrous hydrocyanic acid, they must prove that paracy
anogen can           beproduced
                          so           all; for M. Gay-Lussac found
                                                       at

in conducting certain experiments requiring a long-continued
and uniform degree of heat, from the difficulty of regulating
the temperature of my furnace, and the constant uncertainty
whether everything was proceeding satisfactorily during my
absence from the laboratory.              I had in consequence often
thought of the possibility of so arranging a little thermo
electric apparatus that it might serve as an index of the rate
of combustion and consequent heat of the furnace, by the
deflection of a galvanometer at a distance from the source of
heat. A small thermo-electric battery might be so placed
that the one series of joints or solderings should be constantly
exposed to the heated surface of the furnace; but a serious
obstacle presented itself to any contrivance of this kind, which
was the difficulty of keeping the alternate joints of the battery
cool: a current of electricity would doubtless be evolved in
consequence       of the difference of temperature existing be
tween the two sides of the battery, but of course as the heat
would gradually traverse from the hotter to the cooler side,
it would greatly diminish and modify the results, and thus
present         hi.
                 indications of temperature; whilst even if it were
possible to keep the one side of the battery cool, either by
water or by any other means, yet the value of the deflection
of the galvanometer would be always uncertain, as the differ
ence between the two sides of the battery could never be
 ascertained unless the exact reduction of temperature thus
 caused were correctly known.
     After one or two unsuccessful attempts to overcome this
 objection,      I
                laid aside the battery and substituted in            place            its

    A   piece      copper wire, one twenty-fourth

was then divided about a foot from the joint thus protected;
the two ends of the wire were connected with the extremities
of a galvanometer coil, and the apparatus was complete.
    A metallic circuit was thus made consisting of two ele
ments, the one being the iron-wire, and the other the copper
wire, including the additional length of copper wire in the coil
of the galvanometer. The one joint or point of contact was
of course always far hotter than the other, and would neces
sarily remain so, so long as the fuel in the furnace continued
to burn, and would be dependent on the rate of combustion
in the furnace; whilst the other junction would always remain
very nearly at the temperature of the air, and                      variations     its
 could    be readily known                   by

most common disposition of the palatal teeth is a transverse row
placed at the anterior part of the divided vomer in Frogs, the Meno
pome and gigantic Salamander, and at the posterior part in certain
toads. In the Amphiume”, on the contrary, the palatal teeth form a
nearly longitudinal series along the outer margin of the palatine
bones. The Labyrinthodon, as already shown, combines both these
dispositions of the palatal teeth. The posterior palatine apertures
are more completely circumscribed by bone than in most Batrachi
ans, occupying the same relative position as in the Iguana.            The
posterior margin only of one of the anterior apertures is exhibited
in this specimen, but from its curve Mr. Owen infers that the two
apertures were not confluent, as in the Crocodile, the Frog, or the
Menopome, but that they were distant, as in the Iguana.
   From the physiological condition of the nasal cavity Mr. Owen
is disposed to believe that the Labyrinthodon differed from the Ba
trachians and resembled the Saurians, in having distinct posterior
nasal apertures surrounded by bone, and that its mode of respiration
was the same as in the higher air-breathing reptiles.          In the shed
ding and renewal of the maxillary and the transverse palatal teeth,
Mr. Owen shows that the process took place alternately in each
row, as in many fishes, whereby the dental series is always kept in
an efficient state.
   The author then describes a portion, sixteen inches long, of the
left ramus of an under jaw from the Warwick sandstone, and con
sidered to belong to the same species as the bone just described. It
is slender and straight, and the symphysial extremity is abruptly
bent inwards, and it presents, Mr. Owen says, almost as striking a
Batrachian character as any of the bones just mentioned. The an
gular piece is of great breadth, extending on both sides of the jaw,
and is continued forward to near the symphysis, forming the whole
of the inferior part of the jaw, and extending upon the inner as far
as upon the outer side of the ramus, the inner plate performing the
function of the detached os operculare in the jaw of Saurians. The
dentary bone is supported upon a deep and wide groove along the
upper surface of the angular piece, which also projects beyond the
groove, so as to form a strong convex ridge on the external side of
the jaw, below the dentary piece. This character, which in the
large bull-frog (Rana pipiens) is confined to the posterior part of the
maxillary ramus, is in the Labyrinthodon continued to near the an
terior extremity.     The teeth are long and slender, gradually dimi
nishing in size towards the anterior portion of the jaw, and the
fragment presents a linear series of not less than fifty sockets, placed
alternately a little more internally; and at the anterior inflected
part of the jaw is the base of the socket of a large tooth.        The an
terior portion of the jaw being broken off, it is uncertain if the serial
teeth were continued externally to the anterior tusk, a remarkable
ichthyic character noticed in another species of Labyrinthodon.
   The sockets of the teeth are shallower than in the upper jaw; the

outer wall is more developed than the inner, and the anchylosed
bases of the teeth more nearly resemble, in their oblique position,
those of existing Batrachia.      Mr. Owen then describes the micro
scopic structure of the teeth, and he shows that, between the apex
and the part where the inflected vertical folds of the cement com
mence, the tooth resembles, in the simplicity of its intimate struc
ture", that of the entire tooth of ordinary Batrachia and most rep
tiles ; and in the lower or basal half of the tooth the structure
described in the previous memoir commences, and gradually             in
creases in complexity.     From the long and slender character of this
ramus, Mr. Owen shows that the length of the head, as compared
with the breadth, approximates more nearly to Crocodilian propor
tions than to the ordinary Batrachian ones; but that among existing
Batrachia it resembles most nearly the Amphiume.
     A dorsal vertebra from Coton End, which is next described, pre
 sents still further evidence of the Batrachian nature of the Laby
 rinthodon, in having concave but not deep articular cavities at the
 extremities of the body, a condition now known among existing rep
tiles only in the Gecko, and in the lower or perennibranchiate divi
 sion of Batrachians. The body of the vertebra is elongate and sub
 compressed, with a smooth extended, but not regularly curved sur
 face, terminating below in a slightly produced, longitudinal, median
 ridge; and it exhibits the same exceptional condition in the Repti
 lian class as do the vertebrae of existing Batrachians, in having the
 superior arch or neurapophysis anchylosed with the centrum. From
 each side of the base of the neural arch extends obliquely, outwards
 and upwards, the remains of a thick and strong transverse process;
 and from their strength and direction Mr. Owen gathers indications
 of a necessity for an expanded respiratory cavity, and that they sup
 ported ribs.
     A symmetrical bone, resembling the episternum of the Ichthyosau
 rus, is also described. It consists of a stem or middle, which gradu
 ally thickens to the upper end, where cross-pieces are given off at
 right angles to the stem, and support on each a pretty deep and wide
  groove, indicating strongly the presence of clavicles, and thus point
  ing out another distinction from Crocodiles, in which clavicles are
  wanting.
     In concluding the description of these remains of the Labyrintho
  don leptognathus, Mr. Owen says, that they prove the fossil to have
  been essentially Batrachian, with striking and peculiar affinities to
  the higher Sauria, leading, in the form of the skull and the sculptu
  ring of the cranial bones, to the Crocodilian group, and in one part
  of the dental structure, in the form of the episternum, and the bi
  concave vertebrae, to the Ichthyosaurus; while in the bony palate
  there is a deviation from the Batrachian character, and a resemblance
  to the Lacertian type. Another marked peculiarity in this fossil is
  the anchylosis of the base of the teeth to distinct and shallow sockets,
  by which it is made to resemble the Sphyraena and certain other
  fishes. From the absence of any trace of alveoli of reserve for the

   successional teeth, Mr. Owen believes the teeth were reproduced, as
  in many fishes, especially the higher Chondropterygii, which formed
   the Amphibiae natantes of Linnaeus, in the soft mucous membrane
   which covered the alveolar margin, and subsequently became fixed
   to the bone by anchylosis, as in the Pike and Lophius. No remains
   of the locomotive organs of the L. leptognathus have yet been found.
      Labyrinthodon pachygnathus.-In detailing the remains of this spe
  cies, consisting of portions of the lower and upper jaws, an anterior
  frontal bone, a fractured humerus, an ilium with a great part of the
  acetabulum, the head of a femur, and two unguial phalanges, Mr.
  Owen dwells on further Batrachian characters and certain peculi
  arities of structure, and shows the points in which it agrees with the
  L. leptognathus. A portion, nine and a half inches long, of a right
  ramus of a lower jaw is first described; and in addition to the cha
  racters common to it and the fragment of the lower jaw of the
  L. leptognathus, in the structure of the angular and dentary pieces,
  the author shows that the outer wall of the alveolar process is not
  higher than the inner, as in Frogs and Toads, the Salamanders and
  Menopome, in all of which the base of the teeth is anchylosed to the
  inner side of an external alveolar plate. The smaller serial teeth
  are about forty in number, and gradually diminish in size as they
  approach both ends, but chiefly so towards the anterior part of the
 jaw. The sockets are close together, and the alternate ones are
  empty. The great laniary teeth were apparently three in each sym
  physis, and the length of the largest is considered to have been one
  and a half inch.    A section through the base of the anterior tusk
 above the socket exhibits the structure described in Mr. Owen's first
 memoir; but a section of the second tusk, also taken above the socket,
 exhibited avery simplified modification of the labyrinthic arrangement,
 presenting a disposition closely analogous to that at the base of the
 teeth of the Ichthyosaurus. The apical half of the tusks has a smooth
 and polished surface, and the pulp-cavity is continued, of small size,
 into the centre of this part of the tooth.   In the serial teeth, which
 in other respects, except size, correspond with the preceding descrip
 tion of the tusks, the central pulp-cavity is more quickly obliterated,
 but the alveoli are large, moderately deep and complete: the texture
 of the teeth is dense and brittle. The base of each tooth is anchy
 losed to the bottom of its socket, as in Scomberoid and Sauroid
 fishes; but the Labyrinthodon possesses, Mr. Owen says, a still
 more ichthyic character in the continuation, preserved in this speci
men, of a row of small teeth anterior and external to the two or three
larger tusks. A double row of teeth thus occasioned does not exist
in the maxillary bones, either superior or inferior, of any Batra
chian or Saurian reptile; in Mammalia it has been noticed only in
the upper jaw of the hare and rabbit, and in Fishes only in the
lower jaw.
     A fragment of the superior maxillary bone is also described, and
its chief deviation from the Crocodilian type of structure is the con
tinuation of the palatal plate of the intermaxillary bone for about
an inch to the outer side of the base of the external plate or pro

the skull was formed                 the main after the Crocodilian type, but

and inferior maxillary bones. The most important fact which they
 show is, that this Sauroid Batrachian had subterminal nostrils,
leading           towide and shallow nasal cavity, separated
                    a                                                            broad                by   a

 indicating, with their horizontal position, that their posterior aper
 tures were placed far behind the anterior                         external nostrils; or
 whereas          the air-breathing Batrachia the nasal meatus

    Of the few bones of the extremities which have come under Mr.
Owen's inspection, one presents all the characteristics of the corre
sponding part of the humerus of a toad or frog, viz. the convex,
somewhat transversely extended articular end, the internal longi
tudinal depression, and the well-developed deltoid ridge. The length
of the fragment is two inches, and the breadth is thirteen lines.
The ridges are moderately thick and compact, with a central medul
lary cavity. In              its

 dilian type.

lar cavity with that of a crocodile twenty-five feet in length, then
the hinder extremities of the Labyrinthodon must have been of dis
proportionate magnitude compared with those of existing Saurians,
but of approximate magnitude with some of the living anourous
Batrachia. That such a reptile, of a size equal to that of the reptile
whose remains have just been described, existed at the period of the
new red sandstone, Mr. Owen says, is abundantly manifested by the
remains of those singular impressions to which the term Cheirothe
rium has been applied.           Other impressions, as those of the Cheiro
therium Hercules, correspond in size with the remains of the Laby
rinthodon Salamandroides, which have been discovered at Guy's
Cliff. The head of a femur from the same quarry in which the
ilium was found, is shown to correspond in size with the articular
cavity of the acetabulum. The two toe-bones, or terminal phalanges,
are stated to be strictly Batrachian, presenting no trace of a nail, and
from their size are referred to the hind-feet of the L. pachygnathus.
    Thus, observes Mr. Owen, all these osseous remains from the
Warwick and Leamington sandstones agree in their essentially Ba
trachian nature, and, in this interesting conclusion, with the fossils
of the German keuper; and he concludes this portion of the memoir
with some observations respecting the so-called Cheirotherium foot
steps. He has long believed that they were the foot-prints of a Ba
trachian, and most probably of that family which includes the toad
and frog, on account of the difference of size in the fore and hind ex
tremities; but, in consequence of the peculiarities of the impressions,
he has always considered that the animal must have been quite
distinct in the form of                its
                                    feet from any known Batrachian              other                    or

    In a great number of the beautiful land-shells of the Philippine
Islands, collected by Mr. Cuming, and herein-before described, the
pattern, upon immersion in water or other fluid, becomes entirely
obliterated till evaporation restores the colours to              their pristine                  all
brilliancy.      In

veils the shell when dry, suffers the bright colours            shine out when                to

by the reflected image; the material may be retained in the proper
position against the frame by a small spring,     f,  pressing against the
material on the    back;  and between the    spring  and the frame, c, the
prepared surface is slid.     A small door is made on the top of the
box for the    purpose  of observing  the focal image, and the frame is
slided till  properly  adjusted  to the focus. The box, a, should be
placed on a table or other support, at such height that the centre of
the reflector may be about as high as that part of the person which is
intended to be in the middle of the picture.          When the reflecting
apparatus is to be used, the person whose likeness is to be taken
should be placed in a chair, to which some suitable support for the
head is attached, to enable him to remain perfectly still, and the
reflecting aparatus should then be placed with the open end imme
diately opposite to the person. A trial surface is then to be put
against the frame to receive the reflected image, by which means its
correct placing will readily be judged of by looking through the hole in
the box, a, and the focus will be adjusted by sliding the piece, e ; the
trial surface is then to be removed, and the prepared surface is to be
placed in the frame and allowed to remain as long as required to form
the image, and a little practice will readily enable the operator to
judge when the required effect is obtained. The size of the reflecting
apparatus I use, is as follows: the box, a, inside fifteen inches long,
eight and a half inches high, and eight inches wide, and the interior
is black; reflector seven inches clear diameter, and twelve inches
focus; the prepared surface on to which the picture is to be formed
is two and a half inches long, by two inches wide, but these dimen
sions may be varied. In using the apparatus above described, when
the daylight is very bright, I prefer that the inclined glass roof, A,
 of the room should be glazed with blue glass, or otherwise to soften
the bright rays of light, in order that the person sitting to have a
 likeness taken may be as near as possible to the glass roof; but when
there is a bright sunshine, I use a large looking-glass or reflector.
I  prefer to use a large concave reflector to collect the rays of light
from the sun and throw it on the person sitting.
    I place the reflecting apparatus out of the centre of the large re
flector, B, generally behind the large reflector, by having a hole
through such large reflector towards the outer edge thereof; and in
making such large reflector, B, I find that it may be done by forming
a frame of wood to the figure or shape required, and then covering the
surface with small squares of looking-glass of five or six inches
square; this is a cheap and convenient way of making such a re
flector on a large size for the purpose, but I do not confine myself
thereto, the object being to obtain a large reflector to collect the
light and direct it strongly on a person or other object, from
which it is desired to obtain a likeness or image on to a prepared
surface. In preparing plates with silver surfaces to render them more
suitable for receiving impressions or images thereon, and then have
the surface protected from change,       I  take sheets of copper with a
surface of   silver, such as is now    commonly     used according to the
process known as Daguerreotype, and place two such plates together,
with their silver surfaces touching, those surfaces having been care

fully wiped clean with cotton, and aided, if necessary, with dilute
sulphuric acid; and I pass such two plates five or six times between
a pair of smooth hardened rollers. I then anneal the plates by heat
ing them to a low red heat and permit them to cool. Then I again
subject them to the acid process, and then I pass them, silver face to
face, between the rollers, the rollers being set slightly closer together
 as the plates will have become somewhat thinner, and I repeat such
rolling and annealing till I find the silver surfaces are highly polished
 and equal in appearance                           all
                                     over the silver surfaces. They will then

           ON   THE POLISHED ROCKS OF FONTAINBLEAU.
                                  BY M. DUROCHER.
    In the Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences, for July 12,
1841, we find a “ Notice on the traces of polishing which the dilu
vium has left on the sandstones of Fontainbleau,” by M. Durocher,
of which the following is a translation.
    In the places where the diluvium of the valley of the Seine has
extended, following the general direction from east-south-east to
west-north-west, those marks of polish which are seen so frequently
and so distinctly in Scandinavia and in the Alps, had not hitherto
been observed on the surface of the rocks.             This is probably occa
sioned    by  the soft nature of the rocks which form the Paris basin,
and their mechanical disaggregation under the influence of exterior
agents.      It is the same in the countries to the south of the Baltic,
on which the diluvium of the north has formed thick deposits of the
fragments of the Scandinavian rocks: as only schists or limestones
are found in them, it is not possible that the marks produced by
the passing of the currents should have been preserved to our times;
and yet their existence cannot be called in question; for in boring a
well through the diluvial soil in Prussia, on reaching the solid rock
it was found polished and grooved as in Sweden and Finland: the
 deposit which covered it had served as the means of preservation.
The absence of these traces in many places which have been the
 theatre of diluvial phaenomena, is therefore to be attributed to atmo
spheric action.
     Amongst the formations which constitute the Paris basin, the
 sandstones alone appear to me capable of preserving any remains of
 diluvial impressions: in an excursion which I recently made to Fon
 tainbleau, I indeed recognised that these marks were not entirely
 effaced. In the forest of Fontainbleau there are but very few spots
 where this can be observed; the principal cause which hinders this,
 is,  that the solid sandstone seldom appears                              great     in
                                                                  a at

 unfortunately     in the small number             of
                                               cases where      may     seen,

  border the valley on this side. It is by descending this way, that
  the traces of polish may be observed on both sides of this species of
  defile, but chiefly on the right side. There are very large blocks
  there, and also masses of flattened rock, which seem to be a part of
  the sandstone layers, or to have been but little moved from their
  position.     Upon examining their surface, we see that it is polished,
 and even presents indications of broad furrows, the resemblance of
  which to the diluvian furrows of the Alps or of Scandinavia, it is
 impossible to mistake. A circumstance which precludes any doubt
  that the marks are owing to the action of masses of water,                          that                is,

ON THE COMPOSITION               OF THE BRAIN OF MAN.                       BY M. FREMY.
   It results from the researches of M. Fremy that the brain of man
is formed of a considerable quantity of water and of matter insoluble
in aether, which he describes as albuminous matter.
   The portion soluble in aether is formed chiefly of three substances :
    1st. The white matter discovered by Vauquelin,                  in which M.
Fremy has detected very decided acid properties, and which he calls
cerebric acid.
    2ndly. A liquid fatty matter, which has                 all
                                                          the properties and com
position     of
              the olein     ofhuman     fat,  analysed  by   M. Chevreul.
   3rdly. Cholestrin discovered             inthe brain           by
                                                              M. Couerbe. There
are besides found      in  the brain variable and very small quantities                    of
oleic acid, margaric acid, cerebrate              soda, and albuminous matter;
                                                 of

oleic and margaric acids; the albuminous matter and cerebrate                              of

acid.      In order to purify the cerebric acid, it must                       be boiled      with
slightly acidulated alcohol, in order to                   the cerebrate of

soda, which is always mixed with cerebric acid.         Cold alcohol holds
the olein, and the oleic and margaric acids: it is to be rendered slightly
alkaline by ammonia and evaporated, and by these means the olein is
deposited when the liquor has acquired a certain degree of concentra
tion, whilst the oleate and margarate of ammonia remain in solution.
   The albuminous matter and the cerebrate of soda, which have re
sisted the action of the absolute alcohol, are in their turn treated with
boiling alcohol, acidulated with hydrochloric acid, which decomposes
the cerebrate of soda. The cerebric acid set free dissolves very readily
in alcohol; there then remains a coloured matter, albuminous in its
nature, which contains sulphur, but never phosphorus.
   After having thus determined the composition of the fatty matters
of the brain, M. Fremy examined the substances which M. Couerbe
has described by the names éléencéphol, céphalote and stéaroconote:
and he states that the first is formed of olein and cerebrate of soda ;
that the second contains olein and cerebrate of soda, associated with
traces of albumen; and that the last is merely a mixture of albumen
and cerebrate of soda.
   In analysing the brain in different states and of different ages,
M. Fremy found that the quantity of free fatty acids was variable;
and that it even sometimes increased when the fatty matters were left
in a closed bottle. He discovered the cause of this curious phaeno
 menon by referring to the observations of M. Chevreul on the fat
 of carcases, and to the memoir of MM. Pelouze and Boudet, in which
 they mention the spontaneous saponification of palm oil. He further
observed, that it was the albuminous matter of the brain which had
 the property of eventually converting the olein into oleic acid. Lastly,
 he found by analysis, that           all
                                  the fatty bodies occur     the white sub   in

   ACTION OF PEROXIDE OF IRON ON POTASH.              BY M. FREMY.
   The evident analogy which exists between iron and manganese,

     When a mixture of peroxide of iron and potash is kept for some
time at a strong red heat, a brown mass is obtained, which,
treated with water, gives a solution of a very fine violet-red colour;
this compound is very soluble in water, but a large quantity of water
eventually decomposes it: it becomes insoluble in water which is
very alkaline, but gives a brown precipitate, which dissolves readily
in pure water, and yields a solution of a fine purple colour.              It ap
pears to be much less permanent than manganate of potash; under
certain circumstances it decomposes at common temperatures into
oxygen gas, which escapes, and peroxide of iron which precipitates;
and a solution of free potash remains, which is perfectly colourless.
At 212°Fahr. it undergoes similar decomposition instantaneously:
 all  organic substances decompose it; consequently               impossible            it   is                            to

         DEAR SIR,

some account of my distant wanderings; but the desire to
avoid communicating early conceptions which might be mo
dified by subsequent observation, induced me to stay my pen
until    I
         could offer something worthy of a place in the Phi
losophical Magazine.      The short sketch which follows was
written at Moscow near the close of the journey, and            with                   is,
some very slight alterations, the translation             letter ad        of   a

    Our last year's survey had pretty nearly determined the                                            li
mits  of the great tract              of
                            carboniferous limestone         the North                its of
of  Russia.   On this occasion we have added              upper part            to

                   of a    Geological Survey              of Russia.                                419
that remarkable mass of rock which forms the peninsula of the
Volga near Samara, and which, clearly exposed in lofty, vertical
cliffs, and charged with myriads of the curious fossils Fusilina,
constitutes one of the striking features of Russian geology. .
    The carboniferous system is surmounted, to the east of the
Volga, by a vast series of beds of marls, schists, limestones,
sandstones and conglomerates, to which                              I
                                                   propose to give the
name of “Permian System,” because, although this series re
presents as a whole, the lower new red sandstone (Rohte todte
liegende) and the magnesian limestone or Žechstein, yet it can
not be classed exactly (whether by the succession of the strata
or their contents) with either of the German or British sub
divisions of this age.     Moreover the British lithological term
of lower new red      sandstone”,    is as inapplicable to the great
masses of    marls,  white and  yellow   limestones, and gray copper
grits, as the name of old red sandstone was found to be in re
ference to the schistose black rocks of Devonshire.
    To this “ Permian System” we refer the chief deposits of
§."         of Arzamas, of Kazan, and of the rivers Piana,
   ama and Oufa, and of the environs of Orenbourg; we also
place in it the saline sources of Solikamsk and Sergiefsk, and
the rock salt of Iletsk and other localities in the government
of Orenbourg, as well as                    all
                                   the copper mines and the large

 420     Mr. Murchison's                 Sketch   of some of the principal             Results
    True lias does not exist in Russia, as Von Buch had de
 cided from an examination of fossils sent to him, but the Ju
 rassic or oolitic series is divisible into two stages. The lowest
 of these, which is much more developed than the upper, never
 occupies any considerable tract of country, being either dis
 tributed in patches, or hidden by newer accumulations. From
 the eastern flanks of the Ural chain in the 64° of N. latitude to
 the Caspian Sea, it preserves nearly the same mineral and fos
  silcharacters. This formation represents the inferior and mid
 dle oolite. The ferruginous sands, calcareous grits, and black
 schists      of
              the Moskwa are                  of
                                      this age; and also those beds
 which we examined last year                      on
                                       the Volga between Kostroma
 and    Kinshma,       Makarief

 shales and sands which we have seen this year            many other         in
 localities, particularly between Arzamas and Simbirsk, between
 Syzran and Saratoft,         Saragula, and
                                         at                        on
                                                  the river Ilek near
 Orenbourg.
      The upper oolitic group occurs        several situations along

 of which occupied us nearly three months. We there studied
 alternately the wonders of the gold alluvia, the sites of the
 entombment of your great manmalia, and sought for the causes
 of the astonishing metamorphism of the sedimentary rocks
 of that chain. For an explanation of the last class of phaeno
 mena, the works of Humboldt and Gustaf Rose must always
 be consulted. I will on this occasion simply say, that far from

LXIII.     On the Theory of Storms, with reference to the Views
     of Mr. Redfield. By Robert HARE, M.D., Member of
     the American Philosophical Society, Professor                                            of    Chemistry
     in the University of Pennsylvania *.
1.              R. REDFIELD'S idea, that tornadoes and hurri
                 canes        are   all    whirlwinds,                involves some improbabi
liti
  tles.

           It                                                                                                     be
blasts       nearly equal force coinciding with every tangent
               of
 which can           applied
                         be           circle. Thirty-two ships, equi
                                             to   a
 distant from the axis         gyration  of and from each other, should
each have the wind from             different point
                                                 a        the compass with          of
nearly equal force. The only modification                   which this view          of
of  the case  admits,       that   resulting
                                    is         from the    progressive    mo
tion which tends           increase the velocity
                                   to                      the wind         the     of                    on

Moreover,          respects any one station, the chance would

extremely unfavourable that the same hurricane should twice
proceed from the same quarter: and yet                   the course       time  in                       of
it  would      felt,be   any  station,

directions,      not from every point

424                    Dr. Hare   on the Theory    of Storms,
the other hand, if we attribute the ascent of the air at the
equator to heat, the theory of calorific circulation will account
for the continuance of the process.
    6. In ascribing the prevalence of westerly winds in the
upper regions of the atmosphere to the deflection of the trade
 winds by our mountains, Mr. Redfield's explanation har
 monizes with the theory of Halley.        In fact, is it not reason
 able, that, as the water accumulated by these winds in the
 Gulf of Mexico is productive of a gulf-stream, there should be
 an aérial accumulation and current corresponding with that
 of the aqueous current, which is designated by the name
 above-mentioned?
    7. But not perceiving that the trade winds cannot be ex
 plained without the agency of temperature, Mr. Redfield, in
 the following paragraph, rejects the influence of heat:—
     8. “To me it appears that the causes of the great storms
 may be considered to indicate with entire certainty the great
 law of circulation in our atmosphere; and that the long
 cherished theory, which is founded on calorific rarefaction,
 must give place to a more natural system of winds and storms,
 founded mainly upon the more simple conditions of the great
 laws of gravitation.”
     9. It would seem from this paragraph as well as others, that
 Mr. Redfield admits of no other cause of atmospheric currents
 besides that of gravitation.      But in the absence of calorific
 and electrical     reaction,  what other effect could gravitation
 have, unless that of producing a perfect state of inert quies
 cence?
     10. It is remarkable that the author, after ascribing the
  trade winds to momentum, as the antagonist of gravitation,
  loses sight of it in this summing up of the causes of atmospheric
  currents |
      11.
             If,  Mr. Redfield alleges, the minuteness
                      as                                        the altiof

 extent,          objection
                 be   an        any available currents being induced
                                  to
  by  calorific rarefaction, wherefore, for the same reason, should
 not momentum,          any other cause diminishing
                           or
                                                                be or

     20. But the author has not informed us how these unequal
  or opposing forces are generated in the atmosphere. Without
  any assigned cause, he appeals to “certain opposite and un
  equal forces by which a rotative movement of unmeasured vio
  lence is produced.” This rotative movement, although alleged,
 as above, to be an effect, is stated immediately afterwards to
 be “the only known cause of violent and destructive winds or
 tempests.”
     21. In a memoir on the causes of tornadoes and water-spouts,
 and in some subsequent communications published in the
 Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, and re
 published in Silliman's Journal, various facts and arguments
 were mentioned, tending to prove that the proximate cause of
 the phaenomena of a tornado is an ascending current of air,
 and the afflux of wind from            pointsall   the compass  of    sup                 to

428              Dr. Hare   on the Theory    of Storms,
    27. Mr. Redfield adopts the singular determination of not
noticing the “insuperable difficulties” of the hypothesis which
he has undertaken to set aside. The advocates of the dis
puted hypothesis are not aware of any such difficulties: is it
correct to allege their existence without mentioning the facts
and arguments which justify this allegation?            Without  re
peating here the evidence and the reasoning which I have
already published on this subject, I will advert to one fact
which is utterly irreconcilable with Mr. Redfield's “rotary
theory.”     I allude to the statement of a most respectable wit–
ness, that while the tornado at Providence was crossing the
river, the water, which had risen up as if boiling within a circle
of about 300 feet, subsided as often as a flash of lightning
took place. Now supposing the water to have risen by a de
ficit of pressure resulting from the centrifugal force of a whirl,
how could an electrical discharge cause it to subside?
   28.   I have already, I trust, sufficiently shown that the abor
tive explanation which Mr. Redfield dignifies with the title of
“his theory of rotary storms,” amounts to no more than this:
that certain imaginary, nondescript, unequal and opposing
forces produce atmospheric gyration; that these gyrations, by
their consequent centrifugal force, create about the axis of
motion a deficit of pressure; and hence the upward force dis
played by tornadoes and hurricanes.            I cannot give to this
alleged theory the smallest importance, while the unequal and
opposing forces upon which it is built remain in perfect ob
scurity, the author having disclaimed both the agency of heat
and electricity.
   29. But admitting a whirlwind to be produced, not by a de
ficit of pressure about the axis, but by unequal and opposing
forces acting externally in any competent way whatever, it is
perfectly evident that any deficit of pressure about the axis
consequent to the resulting centrifugal force, could only cause
a descending aerial current, while it could not tend in the
slightest degree to carry solids or liquids aloft.
   30. It must be obvious that the stratum of air on the earth's
surface, partaking of the circular motion, must also partake
of the centrifugal momentum, and of course would have a
disposition the very inverse of that which would cause them
to rush towards the axis; while heavier bodies being sur
rounded by the rarer mediums consequent to the whirl, would
have their gravity less counteracted than usual.           I cannot
help thinking, that as respects the application of his “rotary
theory” to explain tornadoes, these arguments will amount to
a “reductio ad absurdum.”
   31. Mr. Redfield infers that the whirlwinds, of which he as

                with reference to the Views                      of Mr. Redfield.                        429
sumes the existence, have a property which he alleges to be ob
servable in “all narrow and violent vortices, viz. a spirally
.
involute motion quickened in               gyrations   its    approaches        as   it
towards the centre of the axis or whirl.”
     32. But        not evident, that      any mass     ifmatter     made       of               be

 from the axis may           less?    be  appears      me, that the only

 results from the confluence caused                    ascending     by de an                       or
 scending concentric current.          So far therefore         Mr. Red                as
 field's observations confirm the idea that the whirling motion
in   tornadoes quickens towards the centre,             tends     confirm  it               to
 the opinions which           combats, and
                                       he         refute those which to                                    he
 upholds.

may also infer that bodies are carried aloft by the joint action
of electrical attraction, and the vertical blast which it produces.
   40. The effects upon the leaves of trees noticed by me after
the tornado of New Brunswick, in 1835, and still more those
subsequently observed by Peltier after that of Obatenage in
1839, cannot be explained without supposing them to have
been the medium of an electric discharge *.
   41. When a convective discharge takes place between a
stratum of air in proximity to the earth, and a stratum in
the region of the clouds, the greater density and pressure of
the lower stratum will determine the current to rush up in a
vertical direction.

   45. When either electric ocean is minus, the other must
be plus, and at the same time any intermediate stratum of the
atmosphere inclosing a stratum of clouds must be charged
 by induction.
    46. Between the concentric strata of air, severally bound
ing the celestial and terrestrial ocean, there must be an elec
trical attraction tending to counteract gravitation, and thus to
influence the density and pressure of the lower stratum of the
atmosphere.
    47. The proximities of a stratum of clouds electrified by
the celestial ocean, must cause an accumulation of electricity
in any portion of the terrestrial surface immediately subja
cent; and by counteracting gravitation cause a local diminu
tion of atmospheric pressure, which it is well known is a pre
 cursor, and probably a cause of wind and rain.
    48. Those common discharges of electricity which take
place during hurricanes, may be easily accounted for by sup
posing that they result from discharges between the celestial
and terrestrial electric oceans.
   49. Thunder-clouds may owe their charges to the celestial
ocean, either by induction or conduction.       Auroras may be
the  consequence    of  discharges from one   part  of the atmo
sphere to another, through the rare conducting medium which
is occupied by the celestial ocean; or they may result from
discharges from other planets or seas, or from any part of
space, however remote. Since, agreeably to Wheatstone's ex
periments, electricity flies with a velocity not less than that
of light, space can create no obstacle to      passage.             its

    Some years ago, however, this defect of the theory was re
 moved in a memoir presented to the French Institute, by an
 author remarkable as well for the originality as the perspi
 cuity of his views, in which he reduces the motion of the body
 to that of an ellipsoid whose centre is fixed, rolling on a fixed
 plane.
    In the very brief extract which has been published of this
 memoir, Poinsot assumes an ellipsoid whose centre coincides
 with the fixed point, and whose semiaxes are proportional to
the inverse square roots of the moments of inertia, round the
three principal axes passing through the fixed point, coin
ciding with the axes of the ellipsoid ; and thence by the
known geometrical properties of this surface, and the tangent
plane, deduces the nature of the motion, with great elegance
 and simplicity.
   In the following pages an ellipsoid is assumed different
from that of Poinsot, in which the squares of the axes are
proportional to the moments of inertia round the principal
axes of the body passing through the fixed point, coincident
with the axes of this ellipsoid, which may be termed the
Ellipsoid of moments.
    It becomes proper to mention, that as the two ellipsoids of
moments, that assumed by Poinsot, and the one here adopted,
 are reciprocal surfaces,               all
                                  the properties      such motion may    of

together, and also the last three, we find

the axis           of instantaneous rotation coincides with this perpen
dicular.
        XI.     During the whole motion of rotation the semidiameter
of the ellipsoid perpendicular to          the plane       of the     impressed          mo
ment is invariable, or u is constant; to show this we shall
make use of the following property of the ellipsoid:—
        Let    a tangent plane be drawn to an ellipsoid,
                                                 u the semi
diameter  through the point  of contact, P the perpendicular
on this tangent plane from the centre, m the semidiameter
of the ellipsoid perpendicular to the plane of u and P; m
and u are the semiaxes of the section of the surface made by
the plane containing u and m.
   As P is perpendicular to the tangent plane, every plane
which passes through this line is perpendicular to this plane,
hence the plane containing u and P is perpendicular to the
tangent plane.
     n like manner, as the semidiameter m of the ellipsoid is
perpendicular to the plane of u and P, the plane which passes
through m and u, is perpendicular to the plane containing
u and P; hence the tangent plane, and the plane of m and
u, are each perpendicular to the plane of u and P, therefore
their intersection is perpendicular to the same plane, and
therefore parallel to m, and therefore perpendicular to u; but
when a tangent to a conic section is perpendicular to the
diameter passing through the point of contact, this diameter
is an axe of the section; therefore u and m are the semiaxes of
the section of the ellipsoid containing u and m.
   Now u being the axis of the impressed moment, and P the
perpendicular on the tangent plane, through the vertex of u,
P  is the axis of instantaneous rotation, therefore the plane of
u and P is the plane of the centrifugal moment, and m per
pendicular to this plane (V) is            its
                                        axis.
                                      on         m,                                  be

438                     Prof. Booth on the Rotation
end of the first instant the vertex of the axe of the resultant
moment will be found on the curve of double curvature the
intersection of the sphere and ellipsoid; therefore u is con
stant.
  XII.   Now as u is constant, and                      fu also constant                 (7.),   f too
is constant; but the angular velocity

hence the angular  velocity round the instantaneous aris of ro
tation varies inversely as P.

moment is constant during the motion.

rotation round the principal axe whose moment of inertia is
greatest, is to the range in the latter, which may be deemed

        Conversion  of Bisulphuret of Copper into Sulphuret.     443
grains, was placed in a solution of the muriate of barytes, water
only being in the cell containing the zinc with which the ore
was connected.      In a few days the ore was covered with a
reddish-brown powder, which was proved to be peroxide of
iron, beneath which was a coating of vitreous copper. A
quantity of the sulphate of barytes was formed and collected,
and traces of copper were evident in the solution.           During
the   process there was a  steady  liberation of  gas  from the fluid
in contact with the copper ore, which was collected and found
to be pure hydrogen.       This experiment proves that the sul
phur liberated from the yellow ore is converted into sulphuric
acid at the expense of the oxygen of the water, which is seized
by the barytes and forms the sulphate of that earth, and that
the iron is freed in the state of peroxide.        It is possible the
copper detected in this instance may have arisen from the wire
used to make the connexion.          The water in the cell which
contained the zinc was now found, as was of course expect
ed, to hold muriate of zinc in solution.        From the adhesion
 of the peroxide of iron to the piece of ore, it was difficult to
 ascertain the actual loss of weight it had suffered.
    3. Two pieces of copper pyrites, each weighing seventy-two
 grains, were connected by zinc wires with a single pair of
 zinc and copper plates excited by acidulated water, and both
 plunged into a solution of the muriate of soda. The zinc
 wires were so quickly destroyed from the action of the electro
 negative ore on the positive metal, that it was found impossible
 to carry on the experiment for any time. The change was,
 however, well marked even in this case.
     4. Seventy-four grains of copper pyrites was connected by
 silver wire, with the positive pole of a circular battery of a
 single pair excited with salt and water, and fifty-two grains
 of the same ore with the negative pole in like manner. These
 two pieces were placed in a precipitating glass filled with a
 solution of the muriate of barytes.         It will be evident, that
 in this  experiment   the  fragments    of ore form the poles of a
 galvanic arrangement.        In forty-eight hours they were re
  moved; it was now found that one piece weighed seventy-five
 grains, and the other only fifty, the latter being partially
  changed into vitreous ore, while the former was covered with
  specks of the peroride of iron. It was extremely interestin
  to find the peroxide acting as an acid would have done, and
  passing to the positive pole.       Rather more than a grain of
  sulphate of barytes was collected from the glass; and the so
  lution on being treated with the ferrocyanate of potash gave
  a precipitate of the cyanate of copper: copper in minute quan
  tity was also detected by means of a piece of polished iron.

     These experiments appear to me sufficient to prove the
  decomposition of the yellow ore. The loss of weight which
 is detected is accurately made up by the peroxide             the
  sulphur of the sulphate of barytes and the copper.          may
  appear to some that the alterations in weight in the last    ex
 periment (4.) are trifling, but it must be remembered that
 the copper pyrites was exposed, for a short time only, to a
 weak current from a rather inconstant battery.     If the action
 had been continued longer, with a sustaining battery the loss
        §.
 of weight would have been proportionally greater.
    5.        a view of ascertaining the effect of a more pow
                                         I
 erful current on similar pieces of ore, placed one piece in a
 solution of the sulphate of copper, and another in water      di
 vided from it by a membrane, connecting them respectively
 with the positive and negative poles of a battery of twelve
 pairs arranged as the couronne de tasses, excited with strong
 brine.   I thus procured a tolerably powerful, but constantly
 weakening electric current. The arrangement was left for
 two days, when the piece of ore in the solution of sulphate of
 copper, which was connected with the negative pole, was
 found to have crumbled down considerably, eight grains of
 vitreous copper in a state of fine division having been col
 lected from the bottom of the vessel, the loss of weight on
 the whole being ten grains and a half. Nothing is more       in
 teresting than to observe, on the grand scale of natural ope
 rations, examples of processes which we have imitated in
                                                           .

 the correctness of our experiments, and a complete elucida
 tion of a natural phaenomenon.
    At the last annual meeting of the Polytechnic Society, a
communication was read from Joseph Carne, Esq., stating,
that at the mines in the neighbourhood of Marazion, the
phuret of copper was always found in the blue slate, whereas
the vitreous ore was constantly found in the red slate; and
                                  j.
that the same fact was observed at the Carn Brea mines near
 Redruth, where the yellow ore was invariably changed into
vitreous ore whenever the granite exhibited a red colour.
This tincture is due to the peroxide of iron; and it is worthy
of remark, that the stain does not extend many feet on either
side of the load.
    I must be excused from remarking, that it appears to me
evident that the change of the                of copper into the
sulphuret is explained in the preceding experiments, and
shown to depend upon the decomposing power of the electric
currents which circulate through the metalliferous veins, as
was discovered by Mr. Robert Fox, and the decomposing

        Now let us ask what are 68-096 Italian miles? The Italian
     mile was always used, under the idea that it was the old Roman
     mile ; from which in fact it differs little for our present pur
     pose, the latter being about 1614 yards, and the former 1628.
     But not to take any point against Fernel's measure, let us
     follow Dr. Bernard, who makes the statute mile to be 1056
     paces, which would give 1667 yards to the mile of 1000
     paces.     This would give 64} English statute miles to Fernel's
     degree, about five wiles too little.        And              more pro  if,   as   is
     bable, we take 1628 yards for Fernel's Italian mile, we find only
      63  statute miles for his degree.       The French toise 2.1315                         is
     yards;       so
                   that Delambre makes Fernel's degree                 69-12                to    be

feet to a geometrical pace, a thousand of these paces make an

his day. On this the whole question seems to turn, but I

to show that the curious fiction which geometers of the six

                     On Succino-hyposulphuric Acid.
  BY      the action of anhydrous sulphuric acid on benzoic acid,
        Mitscherlich prepared his benzoesulphuric acid (benzoe
 hyposulphuric acid, Fehling). . . Mitscherlich's formula is
  S*O",    C"H"O'        + H2O.         Fehling gives the formula, ac
  cording to Liebig's theory of the constitution of organic acids,
  as  S*O°, C" Hº O' + 2 H2O.                Fehling has succeeded in
  preparing a similar compound with succinic acid. He treated
                                                         .
  succinic acid with the vapour of anhydrous sulphuric acid;
  it is absorbed in large quantities, and heat is evolved; a
  brown elastic mass is formed, which must be allowed to stand
  for twenty-four hours. The mass is then diluted with water,
  and carbonate of baryta or lead added until the filtered solu
  tion gives no precipitate with chloride of barium. The filtered
               j.
  solution is then precipitated by acetate of baryta or lead, and
  from the edulcorated salt of lead the free acid may be prepared
  by means of sulphuretted hydrogen.               The            evapo
  rated in vacuo     gives  small verrucose   crystals,  which cannot be
  perfectly              The acid is soluble in water and alcohol.
   These crystals, when heated with carbonate and nitrate of
  potassa, gave 99.21% sulphate of baryta; according to the for
   mula C*H* O” + Sº O” + 8 H2O, the quantity would be
   99.2%. , The dry acid is probably C*H*O°4' Sº O'4-4 H2O.
   From the composition of the salt of lead, it is probable that
   the acid is quadribasic; 2 (C*H* O' + H2O) + 2 S Oº
   = C*H*O3 + Sº O' + 4 Hº O. By completely saturating
   the acid with potash, a very deliquescent salt is obtained; by
   the addition of a little acid to its solution a salt is formed
   which may be obtained in good crystals, and is not deliques
   cent; it contains six atoms of water; in vacuo it loses two
   atoms. This salt with four atoms loses at 100° three atoms

 On the Compounds of Cyanogen with Sulphuretted Hydrogen.
  Völckel has made some experiments, under Wöhler, on the
two compounds obtained by mixing together cyanogen and
sulphuretted hydrogen.         The yellow compound has been de
scribed   by  Gay-Lussac,    the red one by Wöhler.          By passing
the two   gases  at the same time into        alcohol,  but so that the
cyanogen is always in excess, the yellow body is obtained;
when sulphuretted hydrogen is in excess the red one is form
ed. They may be purified by recrystallization out of alcohol.
The red body has the formula C*N*H*S*.                  By adding ace
tate of lead to an excess of this body dissolved in alcohol, a
yellow precipitate is obtained ;                           its
                                             formula, when dried                                        in

  INhave the course of a limited series of experiments,           which  I
             tried in this interesting branch of the useful      applica
  tion of electricity, a few ideas have occurred to me, which,           I
  believe, possess the charm of novelty.
  however trivial in    itself,  can be    ºred        As no suggestion,
                                                        altogether unim
  portant when it bears on the practical application of science
  to our manufacturing arts, I feel no hesitation in laying be
  fore the Society the following remarks with a view to their
  being made public.          It is quite evident that Mr. Spencer's
  recent discovery, of the art of depositing metals from a solu
  tion of their salts by galvanic action, has placed in the hands
  of manufacturers a new means of copying, and the importance
  of this will be immediately apparent to those who know how
  large a portion of our manufactures in metal are the copies
  of original matrixes, or more indirectly the results of other
  copying processes.         Some imagine that because it is only
                    copying,   it is really of little value; but it is im

        Mr. T. B. Jordan's Remarks                             on Electro-Metallurgy.                            453
in part owe their origin to copying.    then it can be shown          If
that this method possesses advantages for some description of
work, which are not common to any other, and that there is
good reason to suppose it may be oeconomically conducted,
then we may fairly infer, that it will in due time become one
of the ordinary processes of our factories.
     Its    advantages are numerous, and some of them so self
evident, that they only require naming to be allowed; for                                                         in

its elements, so also for the formation of these azotated neutral
matters, it suffices to unite carbon and ammonium with the
elements of water; forty-eight molecules of carbon, six of am
monium, and seventeen of water, constitute, or may constitute,
fibrine, albumen and caseum.
     Thus in both cases, reduced bodies, carbon or ammo
nium, and water, suffice for the formation of the matters
which we are considering, and their production enters quite
naturally into the circle of reactions, which vegetable nature
seems especially adapted to produce.
     The function of azote in plants is therefore worthy of the
 most serious attention, since it is this which serves to form the
                                                                             of all
 fibrin which is found as the rudiment in             the organs, since
it   is this which serves for the production          the albumen and
 caseum,         largely diffused

   So far then the vegetable is an unceasing producer; but if
at times, if to satisfy certain wants, the vegetable becomes a
consumer, it realizes exactly the same phaenomena which the
animal will now set before us.
   V.—An animal in                    fact constitutes an apparatus                 of combus

 which consequently carbon undergoes combustion.

 cold-blooded animals, which would seem to designate some
 animals destitute of the property of producing heat. Iron,
which burns vividly in oxygen, produces a heat which no
one would deny; but reflection and some science is necessary
in order to perceive, that iron which rusts slowly in the air
disengages quite as much, although                             its
                                                  temperature does not
sensibly vary. No one doubts that lighted phosphorus                                               in
burning produces great quantity

accompanied by circumstances that render it more than doubt
ful. The constant phaenomenon is the exhalation of gas.
   We must therefore conclude with certainty, that we never
borrow azote from the air; that the air is never an aliment
to us; and that we merely take from it the oxygen necessary
to form carbonic acid with our carbon, and water with our hy
drogen.
    The azote exhaled proceeds then from the aliments, and it
originates from them entirely. This, in the general oeconomy
of nature, may in thousands of centuries be absorbed by
plants, which, like Jerusalem artichokes, draw their azote                                       di
 rectly from the air.

sufficiently divided to be taken up by the orifices of the chyli
ferous vessels.
   Besides, the evident object of digestion is to restore to the
blood a matter proper for supplying our respiration with the
ten or fifteen grains of coal, or the equivalent of hydrogen
which each of us burns every hour, and to restore to it the
grain of azote which is also hourly exhaled, as well by the
lungs or the skin as by the urine.
    Thus the amylaceous matters are changed into gum and
 sugar; the saccharine matters are absorbed.
    The fatty matters are divided, and converted into an emul
sion, and thus pass into the vessels, in order to form depôts
 which the blood takes back and burns as it needs.
    The neutral azotated substances, fibrin, albumen and ca
seum, which are at first dissolved, and then precipitated, pass
into the chyle greatly divided or dissolved anew.
   The animal thus receives and assimilates almost unaltered the
azotated neutral substances which it finds ready formed in the
animals or plants upon which it feeds; it receives fatty matters
 which come from the same sources; it receives amylaceous
or saccharine matters which are in the same predicament.
    These three great orders of matters, whose origin always
ascends to the plant, become divided into products capable
 of being assimilated, fibrin, albumen, caseum, fatty bodies,
 which serve to renew or recruit the organs with the com
 bustible products, sugar and fatty bodies which respiration
 consumes.
    The animal therefore assimilates or destroys organic mat
 ters ready formed; it does not create them.
    Digestion introduces into the blood organic matters ready
formed; assimilation employs those which are azotated;
respiration burns the others.
  If  animals do not possess any peculiar power for producing
organic matters, have they at least that special and singular
power which has been attributed to them of producing heat
without expenditure of matter?
    You have seen, while discussing the experiments of MM.
Dulong and Despretz, you have positively seen the contrary
result from them. These skilful physicists supposed that an
animal placed in a cold water calorimeter comes out of it with
the same temperature that it had on entering

disengages carbonic acid; that             becomes arterial without

    Between these three        masses,   continual      exchanges   take place:
matter descends from the air into             plants,    enters      this route      by
into animals, and returns              the air according

use of it.

    Animals assimilate              absorb the organic matters formed

 70    Mr.   Bowman on the question, Whether there are
doubted evidence of the former greater extent of glaciers may
be gradually traced from the warm valleys of the Alps up to
the actual feet of existing glaciers, the greater altitudes of the
mountains and increased distance from the modifying influ
ence of the sea, will be found more than adequate to compen
sate for their being situated ten degrees nearer to the equator.
 In this view it is therefore possible, assuming the theory of
 Prof. Agassiz of a general reduction of temperature in ancient
 times over the whole northern hemisphere, that Switzerland
 might be covered with ice and snow, while Britain might be
 comparatively free from them.          But this reasoning, though
 plausible on a cursory glance, falls to the ground, if we ac
 cept the theory of this distinguished philosopher, that the gla
 cial period occurred antecedent to the elevation of the Alps.
  There is abundance of direct geological evidence to prove
 that they have been raised, at least much higher than before,
  since the deposition and consolidation of the tertiary strata;
  and as it is scarcely less certain that the primary mountains
  of Britain were raised at a much earlier period, it seems to
  follow from their altitude and higher latitude, that the sur
  rounding region must have been the seat of more intense cold
  than Switzerland, then without high mountains and situated in
  a much warmer climate.
      Having spent a portion of the late summer in endeavouring
  to trace the geological sequence of the schistose rocks of North
   Wales, I have been naturally led into some high and unfre
   quented tracts where it seemed probable, if anywhere, that
   evidence of glaciers would be found.      I  have examined many
   of the main and lateral  valleys  on the east and south flanks of
   the Snowdon group, of the Arenigs, and of the north end of
   Berwyn chain, as well as of the moorland hills of Denbigh
   shire, between Cerrig y Druidion and Llanrwst; also those
   which intersect the wild and barren hills that occupy the coun
   try between the great Holyhead road and Bala, and form the
   dividing ridge between Merionethshire and Denbighshire.
   These valleys descend from the highest mountains of North
   Wales, and are the troughs through which the numerous           tri
   butaries of the Dee, the Clwyd, and the Conway, are carried
   into the lower parts of the country.         Many of them, from
   their smooth uniform    slopes   and  easy  inclinations,  seem cal
   culated to give rise    to,
                            and      retain those appearances which
                                    to
   glaciers usually create and leave behind them.          In   none of
   them, however, have  I   found any features which appeared        to
   me to   have been produced       by
                                    glaciers; none  at   least have re
                                                             justify me

   tained that outward form       shape   which seemed   to
 in    referring them tosuch       origin.

there through the districts                    I
                                    have named, which, if they have
not  originated   in  glaciers,  bear a sufficient resemblance to re
quire a close examination.         It is more important to make this
examination than may at first sight appear, in order to guard

tion from attributing every accumulation of gravel or streaked
rock to such an origin.                    satisfied myself, from per
sonal observation, that existing glaciers form moraines on their
sides and at their feet, and abrade the rocks over which they
move, so as to scratch and polish their surfaces, it has con
stantly been my practice to see, in the first place, if the ana
                                  I
logous appearances have met with in North Wales were not
capable, on taking into account                            all

Similar mounds mask the rocky slope on the opposite bank of
the Conway as high as half a mile above Yspytty, becoming
gradually lower and thinner till they disappear altogether. In
a north-west direction they extend from Pentre Voelas to the
opening of the valley of the Machno, and may often be seen
on both sides the great road in the less precipitous parts of the
gorge, though more frequently and more distinctly on the left
bank of the river. From partial openings into several of them,
I  saw they were formed of local drift or gravel from the neigh
bouring dark schistose rocks, without any large boulders. In
one of them, near the great road, there was a streaked or
bedded character, the layers being formed of pebbles of dif
ferent sizes, as though they had been left by a current which
had varied in intensity. It appeared to me that these hills
were not composed throughout of this gravelly drift, but that
this material only formed a coat or covering upon the previ
ously existing prominences of the lower Silurian schist of the
district, sufficiently thick to conceal the rocky nucleus and to
give it a smooth rounded outline. Neither could I attribute
 their shape to any form or modification of lateral moraine;
and    I was of opinion, that even should any one contend that
they had originated in a glacier, it would be necessary to ad

is not easy to understand how so large a mass of diluvium
 could have been accumulated in this particular locality. See

     any Evidences     of former Glaciers in North    Wales 2        473
  The next class of appearances I      have met with in North
Wales resembling those produced by glacier action, are the
striae or scratches on the surfaces of rocks. Of these I have
found several decided and strongly marked instances; and as
they are due to various causes, and can in some cases be de
monstrated not to have been connected with glaciers, it may
be useful to describe them somewhat in detail.
     The first I met with occurs in the Upper Silurian rocks on
the right bank of the Dee, in the immediate neighbourhood of
Llangollen. Here the true stratification is easily ascertained,
since it is not affected by any cleavage, though the rock has a
system of joints which divide the beds diagonally to the planes
of the surface into irregular rhombs. The beds are nearly
horizontal, having an average dip to the S.S.E. of about five
or six degrees; and they rise to the height of from 300 to 400
feet, without any apparent dislocation or change in the direc
tion of the dip. At the base of this precipitous hill, and in a
little quarry, the outcrop of the beds is seen in various places;
their surfaces are generally smooth and uniformly plane, oc
casionally slightly undulated. I observed the level surface of
one of them to be streaked or traced with strong and perfectly
 parallel grooves or furrows, some as fine as though they were
 made by the point of a pin, and others the eighth of an inch
 wide, promiscuously and closely ranged alongside others of
intermediate dinensions. The whole surface was occupied by
 these grooves and their intermediate ridges, and had the ap
 pearance of having been planed with a tool with a snipped or
 indented edge. Some of the broader furrows were truncated
 and terminated abruptly, and one or more narrower ones
 seemed to be connected with and to issue from them.          The
 range or bearing of the striae was N.N.W. and S.S.E., and
 the breadth of surface exposed was from twenty-five to thirty
 yards, every part of which was channeled in the manner de
 scribed. It was at once evident, from the general appearance
 of the quarry, that this bed had never been exposed or dis
 turbed from those above or below      it,since   was closely and
                                                 it
  conformably overlaid      by
                            the mass above, the whole having          a
  slight inclination    the S.S.E. The furrows were also evi
                       to          .
  dently continued inwards upon the yet undisturbed portions;
  butto  remove  all doubt upon this head, employed quarry

  clear and strong. The specimens      I obtained were from this
  part, and had never before been exposed since the original de
  position of  the beds. The under surface       the superincum
                                                 of
  bent bed was moreover   similarly though  more faintly streaked;

474       Mr. Bowman       on the question, Whether there are
in some places so obscurely, that it would not have been per
ceived to be so on casual inspection; but in others, very clearly.
There was another bed lying about a foot lower in the series,
similarly though less distinctly striated; and the striae had              ex
actly the same direction.
   It was therefore abundantly clear that these grooved striae
could not have been produced by glacial action, or indeed by
any cause operating after the original deposition or consolida
tion of the beds; inasmuch as they are nearly at right angles
to the course of the river, and therefore to the direction of a
glacier, and especially as they are found under beds in close
contact, that have never suffered any partial or relative dis
turbance inter se”.     Since, however, they exist on two sur
faces in  contact, and somewhat resemble those polished por
tions of rocks well known by the name of Slickensides, which
are believed to be the effect of friction on two surfaces rubbed
against each other, it is worth while to examine whether they
might not have been produced by a similar action. As already
stated, the appearance of the quarry and precipice above the
road shows that the rock has been tilted aside en masse, and
has not been affected by any partial or subsequent dislocation;
and the nearly horizontal position of the beds renders it ex
tremely improbable, if not impossible, that they could have
been so rubbed against each other as to produce the furrows
in question.    The appearance called Slickensides is found on
the perpendicular or slanting sides of fissures and veins, and is
caused by the unequal and repeated motion of the two surfaces
against each other. But in proportion as the direction'of these
sides varies from the slanting to the horizontal position, this kind
of action diminishes, from the increasing difficulty of maintaining
motion on the horizontal plane. Great lateral pressure, from
the gravity of an upheaved mass, may suddenly and for once
act horizontally; but a succession of alternating throes or pa
roxysms can only be propagated from below; from any
point, motion would soon be overcome by the vis inertiae of
                                                                       º:
the mass. . It is easy to understand how the upper portion of
a stratified rock may slide off         base when but gently in
                                         its

                    is

    Again, an examination of the striae in hand specimens will
show that some of the more delicate lines diverge from the
general parallelism, and unite with the contiguous ones with
out suffering interruption from the intervening furrows.                     In
some parts of the surface there are groups of faint transverse
elevations and depressions which run across many contiguous
striae with a gentle curve; and in others the grooving is not
confined to a single plane, but seems to penetrate beneath the
surface, and to pervade several laminae inwards.                      None of
these    appearances       could have been      produced     by  a hard body

   more regular lines which cross the larger undulations at an

    A slight   notice of a different kind of striae on the Welsh
rocks, arising from another cause and capable of easy expla–
nation, will be sufficient. At the north end of Trefriw, in the
vale of Llanrwst, by the side of the road to Conway, large sur
faces of the true beds of Lower Silurian rocks are laid bare in
several different places; they have an average dip of about
18° to the E.S.E., and form smooth and regular inclined
planes.    This arises from wayboards of softer shale, or from
slight adhesion of the beds. On one of these inclined planes
to the north of the little quay, are many nearly parallel lines
or striae, running in the direction of the valley, which are very
liable to be mistaken for those produced by glaciers grating
upon their bed. But on close examination               found them to         I

 that it was not necessary to call in the aid of glaciers.         The
spot is well known to tourists as one of the wildest and most
alpine in North Wales, where the torrents from Llyn Ogwen
and Llyn Idwal, on issuing from their respective lakes, are
precipitated over the rocky barrier that forms the head of
 Nant Francon.        Standing on the bridge between these two
 torrents, the rocks on both sides, that form, as it were, the
 crest of this barrier, and obstruct the free passage of the water,
 seem to have a smooth or rounded form that is evidently not
 natural. That in the stream of the Ogwen is the largest and
 the most regularly domed; and the side next the bridge
 having been recently cut away in the direction of the cleavage,
 their planes form a perpendicular face, on which the true lines
 of stratification may be traced with sufficient distinctness.
 The dip is towards the S.E. at an angle of about 40°, thus
 proving the rounded top to have no connexion with either of
 the divisional planes just named, or with the intersecting
joints, which, as usual, have flat surfaces.       Though rounded,
 the surface is not polished, but has a dull and weathered ap
 pearance, the effect of abrasion rather than of friction, on the
 hard hornstone porphyry, of which the rock is composed.*
 These rounded bosses of rock are at present some feet higher
 than the level of the respective torrents that wash their bases;
 but it is not difficult to believe that a period has existed when
 they were covered by the torrent, and that in the lapse of
 ages, the stones and ice it has carried along with              having           it,
 given them this rounded form, have continually deepened the
channel, till the domed surfaces have been left projecting                                 in
 their present situation.

               with reference to the detection   of Arsenic.           481
   adopted by    M. Fuchs for the analysis of crude iron and iron
   ores”.
      A slip of copper immersed into hydrochloric acid, sp. gr.
   1°172, containing arsenic, was not acted upon,
                                                           in a closed
   vessel, after remaining twelve hours at the ordinary tempera
  ture; if the acid was diluted with an equal quantity of water,
  action took place after a few hours, the arsenic being preci
  pitated upon the copper; if the solution was exposed
                                                                  to the
  air the action occurred in a still shorter time, but if heated
  it took place nearly immediately, whether the acid was con
  centrated or diluted.     The copper was covered at first with
  a grayish brilliant metallic coating, which upon increase of
  temperature, and according to the quantity of arsenic present
 in the solution, turned black, and finally separated in black
  scales.
     In  order to ascertain the delicacy of this reaction, a solu
 tion of one part of arsenious acid was made in 1000 parts of
 pure hydrochloric acid diluted with water. A portion of
                                                                     this
 solution (to which one-third of pure hydrochloric acid was
 added), containing 1-100,000th part of arsenic, was acted upon
 as soon as it was heated; at first the precipitate had the ap
 pearance of iron, but after long boiling it became black
                                                                    with
 a metallic lustre. With a solution containing 1-200,000th
 part, the copper was distinctly covered with arsenic after a
quarter of an hour's boiling. The limit appears to be
                                                               between
 1–250th and 1-300,000th parts; and is therefore consider
ably greater than that of any other reagents, and is not likely
 to be mistaken for other substances.
     If arsenious acid be dissolved in water, and a slip of copper
immersed, no action takes place; but if a few drops of hydro
chloric acid be poured upon the copper, the arsenic is imme
diately precipitated... A quantitive estimate of the arsenic
may be made by this method, as on boiling the
                                                               solution
nearly the whole of the arsenic is separated from the copper,
and the quantity of arsenic may be calculated from the loss of
weight sustained by the copper. The arsenic
                                                        obtained may
either be further tested by Marsh's apparatus, or it may be heat
ed in an open glass tube, when brilliant crystals of arsenious
acid will be obtained, which may be dissolved in a weak alka
line solution and tested by the usual reagents; or the slip of
copper may be heated in a glass tube with hydrogen gas,
when metallic arsenic will be sublimed. .               -            -

    Tin.—Copper does not occasion a precipitate in a solution
 of this metal containing 1-100th part to which an equal

 metallic precipitate.    If exposed to the air in an open vessel,
 the metal is   precipitated  after a few days as a grayish black

 copper was immediately covered with a grayish metallic coat

The metal was also precipitated from very weak solutions.
    Mercury.—A solution containing 1-1000th part of mer
cury mixed with hydrochloric acid, was immediately precipi
tated upon the copper as a white coating.         A solution con
taining 1-50,000th part of corrosive sublimate without the
addition of hydrochloric acid, had no action on the copper
when cold; on heating it produced a golden colour; on ad
dition of hydrochloric acid and after boiling, the copper had
a gray appearance, and metallic mercury might be observed
by means of a single microscope.

dendritical crystals formed, which were increased upon heat
ing the solution. A solution containing 1-50,000th part of
silver without hydrochloric acid, gave the copper a yellowish
tinge, which disappeared upon adding hydrochloric acid, but
no silver was separated with a solution containing 1-20,000th
part silver; the metal was precipitated in metallic spots.

   It follows  from this examination:—
   1st. That metallic copper is the most delicate and surest re
agent for the detection of arsenic, the reaction taking place
with a solution containing 1-200,000th part.
   2nd. That with antimony the action is similar to arsenic,
but it is not precipitated with such a metallic lustre, and dif
fers from it by the decided violet colour produced.
   3rd. That lead and tin are not precipitated either from a
concentrated or dilute solution in the metallic state; this
only occurs upon exposure to the air.
   4th. The solution of bismuth is immediately precipitated
in a crystalline state.
   5th. That silver and mercury are precipitated with a silver
lustre, and the reaction does not exceed a 1-20,000th part in
solution.

                 1. “Experiments on the electric conditions of the
Rocks and Metalliferous Veins (Lodes) of Longclose and Rosewall
Hill Mines in Cornwall.” By William Jory Henwood, Esq., F.R.S.,
&c., Secretary of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall.
   The experiments, of which the results are given in this paper, were
undertaken with the view of determining whether it was in conse
quence of the imperfections of the galvanometers, or other apparatus,
employed, that Mr. R. W. Fox, and other experimenters, had been
unable to detect the presence of electricity in the tin veins of Corn
wall. The mode of experimenting was in principle the same as that
pursued by Mr. Fox, namely, that of placing plates of metal in con
tact with the points to be examined, carrying wires from the one to
the other, and interposing a galvanometer in the circuit. The plates
employed were of sheet-copper and sheet-zinc, and they were about
six inches long, and three inches and a half wide.       The wires were
of copper, one twentieth of an inch in diameter, and the same that
had been used by Mr. Fox.
   The tabular results of these experiments show that both the gra
nite and the tin vein at Rosewall Hill mine, and also the greenstone
and the copper vein in that of Longclose, present unequivocal traces
of electric currents, whether different parts of the same veins or va
rious portions of the same rocks were examined.

   It also appears, from these experiments, that the nature and posi
tions of the small metallic plates employed materially affect, not only
the intensity, but in some cases also the directions of the currents;
and also that there is a considerable difference in the results when the
same plates of metal    are   placed     on   different ingredients in the veins,

   Of the various names, such as “useful effect,” “dynamical effect,”
“efficiency,” “work done,” “labouring force,” “work,” which have
been given to that operation of force in machinery which consists in
the union of a continued pressure with a continued motion, the au
thor gives the preference to the term work, as being that which con
veys, under                its
                 most intelligible form, this idea      the operation                                     of                               of

a principle, first published by himself in a paper on the ‘Theory of
the Equilibrium of Bodies in contact,' printed in the fifth volume of
the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, viz. “that when the
surfaces of two bodies are in contact under any given pressures, and
are in the state bordering upon motion, on those surfaces, then the
common direction of the mutual resistances of the surfaces is inclined
to their normal at the point of contact at a certain angle, given in
terms of the friction of the surfaces by the condition that its tangent
is equal to the coefficient of friction.”      This angle the author has
called “the limiting angle of resistance:” it has since been used by
 other writers under the designation of the “slipping angle.”
    He next proceeds to determine the modulus of a simple machine,
 moveable about a cylindrical axis of given dimensions, and acted
 upon by any number of pressures in the same plane.                He applies
 the  principle last stated to determine the     general   conditions of the
 equilibrium of these pressures, in the state bordering upon motion
 by the preponderance of one of them; and, solving the resulting
 equation in respect to that one pressure by the aid of Lagrange's
 theorem, he deduces immediately the modulus from this solution by
 principles before laid down. The modulus, thus determined, he then
 verifies by an independent discussion of that particular case in which
 three pressures only are applied to the machine, one of which has its
 direction through the centre of the axis.
    This solution he next considers more particularly with reference
 to a machine moveable about a fixed axis under one moving and one
 working pressure (their directions being any whatever) and its own
 weight; which last is supposed to act through the centre of the
 axis. He shows that it is a general condition of the greatest eco
 nomy in the working of such a machine, that the moving and work
 ing pressures should have their directions, one of them upwards, and
 the other downwards, and that both should therefore be applied on
 the same side of the axis of the machine.          He moreover shows that
 if the direction of one of these      pressures   be given, there is then a
 certain  perpendicular    distance of the other from the centre of the
 axis, and a certain inclination of its direction to the vertical, at
 which perpendicular distance, and which inclination, this pressure
 being applied, the machine will yield a greater amount of work, by
 the expenditure of a given amount of power, than it will yield under
 any other circumstances of                 its
                                      application:      that this particular
                                                       so
 distance and inclination are those whence results the most economi
 cal working   of  the machine.

   3. “On the Nervous Ganglia of the Uterus.”        By Robert Lee,
M.D., F.R.S.
   The author, in a paper which was read to the Royal Society on
the 12th of December, 1839*, had described four great plexuses under
the peritoneum of the gravid uterus, having an extensive connexion
with the hypogastric and spermatic nerves.      From their form, co
lour, general distribution, and resemblance to ganglionic plexuses of
nerves, and from their branches actually coalescing with those of the
hypogastric and spermatic nerves, he was induced to believe, on first
discovering them, that they were ganglionic nervous plexuses, and
that they constituted the special nervous system of the uterus. He
states in the present paper, that subsequent dissections of the unim
pregnated uterus, and of the gravid uterus in the third, fourth, sixth,
seventh, and ninth months of pregnancy, have enabled him not only
to confirm the accuracy of his former observations, but also to dis
cover the important fact, that there are many large ganglia on the
uterine nerves, and on those of the vagina and bladder, which enlarge
with the coats, blood-vessels, nerves, and absorbents of the uterus
during pregnancy, and which return, after parturition, to their ori
ginal condition before conception took place. The author next pro
ceeds to describe the two great ganglia situated on the sides of the
neck of the uterus, in which the hypogastric and several of the sa
cral nerves terminate, and which he calls the hypogastric, or utero
cervical ganglia.    In the unimpregnated state, they are of an irre
gular, triangular, or oblong shape, about half an inch in the long
diameter, and always consist of grey and white matter, like other
ganglia.    They are covered by the trunks of the vaginal and vesical
arteries and veins; and each ganglion has an artery of considerable
size, which enters it near the centre and divides into branches, ac
                                               of its
companying the nerves given off from        anterior and inferior borders.
From the inner and posterior surface        each     these ganglia, nerves

 on   the sides     the vagina, and between the vagina and rectum.

From the inferior border        each hypogastric ganglion several fasci

 culi   ofnerves are given off, which pass down                  on
                                                          the sides    the         of
vagina, and enter some large flat ganglia, midway between the                             os
 uteri and ostium vaginae.     From these vaginal ganglia innumerable
 filaments      nerves,
               of             on
                           which small flat ganglia are formed, extend

ries; and they often form complete rings of nerve around the trunks
of the great veins.
   The author then describes the nerves which are given off from the
anterior margin of each hypogastric ganglion, some of which pass on
the outside of the ureter and others on the inside, and meet in front
of the ureter in a ganglion, which he calls the middle vesical ganglion.
There are other two ganglia, he states, formed on these nerves; one
between the uterus and ureter, and the other between the ureter
and vagina. These he calls the internal and erternal vesical ganglia.
Not only is the ureter inclosed within a great ring of nervous mat
ter, which, he says, resembles the oesophageal ganglia in some of the
Invertebrata; but the trunks of the uterine artery and vein are like
wise encircled by a great collar of nervous matter, between which
and the hypogastric ganglion several large and some small branches
pass.
   The author gives the following description of the vesical ganglia.
The internal vesical ganglion, which usually has a flattened or long
bulbous shape, is formed entirely upon the nerves which pass from
the hypogastric ganglion, and run between the uterus and the ureter.
It has an artery which passes through              centre.         its
                                                                 first gives off      It                   a

                                                                                                           to of

 tric, vaginal, vesical and uterine ganglia are delineated in the fourth
 month of pregnancy, and also the plexuses of nerves on the anterior
 surface of the uterus.
    From an examination with the microscope of portions of the
plexuses under the peritoneum of a gravid uterus in the ninth month,
which had long been immersed in rectified spirit, Professor Owen
and Mr. Kiernan inferred that they were not nervous plexuses, but
bands of elastic tissue, gelatinous tissue, or cellular membrane.
    The author concludes his paper with a letter from John Dalrym
ple, Esq., containing the results of the observations he had made
with the microscope on the uterine nerves in the recent state. Fila
ments of the nerves which surrounded the ureter, and which were
situated upon the body of the uterus, were submitted to the micro
scope. The instrument employed was a very powerful object-glass,
whose focus was the eighth of an inch, made by Ross. Mr. Dal
rymple found that it was impossible, even with the most careful dissec
tion, to detach any filament of nerve without including a quantity of
cellular and elastic tissue; so that although the tubular portion indi
cating the nerve was distinct, yet it was surrounded by innumerable
extremely minute threads coiled and contorted, such as those which
constitute the component of elastic tissue, and the ultimate element
of cellular membrane. Under slight pressure, however, the tube was
plainly discernible, and was found to contain granular matter, not
uniformly distributed, but collected in minute masses at intervals.
Small blood-vessels were also here and there seen, with blood-discs
within them, which served to indicate the difference between the
nervous and vascular tubes, and thus to avoid the possibility of error.
Being, however, aware that some of the most distinguished foreign
microscopical anatomists had differed as to what was the real cha
racteristic of the nerves of the sympathetic system, and feeling, from
this discordance of opinion, that there was no absolute test, or at
least none which was not open to cavil, Mr. Dalrymple thought of
making a comparison of the uterine nerves with those that undenia
bly belonged to the ganglionic system. He therefore traced some
nerves on the surface of the stomach up to the great ganglion that
gave them origin; and he selected some also from the small intestine.
These he submitted to the same microscopical power, and under the
same circumstances of light, and pressure, and medium.          In all of
these he observed the tubular part filled with granular matter, and
similarly collected in minute masses.       He also observed that each
tube was surrounded by the minute serpentine threads before de
scribed.    In fact, so closely did they agree in every particular with
the appearances presented by the uterine nerves, that it would have
been impossible to distinguish the one from the other.

    The Memoir, of which       the following is an abstract, is the result
of a   journey   through   the Northern and Central Governments of
 Russia in Europe, made during the summer of 1840, a verbal account
of some of the chief points of which, accompanied by a new geo
logical map of those regions, was offered to the public at the meet
ing of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, in
 September 1840.
   Introduction.—The authors preface their memoir with a sketch of
the condition of geological knowledge concerning the flat and cen
tral countries of Russia in Europe anterior to their visit, and show
 that the early efforts of Strangways * had not been followed up by
any connected attempt to establish the classification and succession
of the older sedimentary deposits on the true principles of the order
of their superposition, and their distinctions by organic remains.
They point out, however, that certain elements of the subject had
been prepared; first, by the map and descriptions of Strangways;
secondly, by the publication of the palaeontological works of Fischer
 de Waldheim, Pander, and Eichwald; thirdly, by the recent re
 searches of Colonel Helmersen in the Waldai Hills; and fourthly,
by the important zoological distinctions indicated by M. Leopold de
Buch, who, on hearing of the plan of the voyage of the authors, ex
pressed his belief (from the examination of certain fossils alone) that
 the triple subdivision of the palaeozoic rocks into the Carboniferous,
 Old Red, and Silurian systems, as indicated by Mr. Murchisont,
would be found to prevail in Esthonia, Livonia and Courland.
    After alluding to the vast importance to the Russian empire of a
correct knowledge of the subsoil of these flat regions, the authors
explained the scheme which they had devised, before they left their
own countries, for ascertaining the data required. Aware of the two
great difficulties which are opposed to the examination of this region,
—the slight altitude of the masses above the sea, and the vast quan
tity of drift or the slight superficial detritus which obscures the fun
damental rocks,—they overcame these obstacles by examining, in
succession,    the banks of the rivers between the longitude of St.
Petersburgh and of Archangel, which, flowing from N.N.W. to
 S.S.E., or transverse to the only apparent lines of elevation, might
be expected to offer the evidences required. They also ascended the
great Dwina, from the White Sea to Oustiug Veliki; and afterwards
extended their researches to the south of Nijnii Novogorod, in order
to determine the relations of the secondary rocks to those older
deposits with which they had become familiar.
    In terminating these introductory explanations, the authors dwelt
with pleasure on the valuable assistance they had received, particu
larly in the early part of their tour, from the Baron A. de Meyen
dorff, now executing, by order of his Imperial Majesty, a statistical
survey of Russia, who endeavoured to combine geology and natural
history with the chief object of his expedition by attaching to it two
excellent naturalists, Count Keyserling and Professor Blasius. They

further testified their warm thanks to the Russian minister, the
Count de Cancrine, who specially aided this geological inquiry, and
they also acknowledged their obligations to Count Nesselrode, Count
Alexander Strogonoff, Baron Humboldt, Baron Brunnow, and Gene
ral Tcheffkine. They further expressed their sense of the value of
the services of a zealous young geologist, Lieutenant Koksherof,
without whose aid the authors could not have accomplished their
task. A geological map and sections illustrated the description, and
the characteristic fossils of each group were laid upon the table.
     Crystalline Rocks, Metamorphic Rocks, Trap Rocks, Physical Geo
graphy, &c.—Before they proceed to describe the sedimentary de
posits in their order from S. to N., or from the older to the younger
strata, the authors mention some peculiar varieties of gneiss which
occupy the little islands of the White Sea near Onega, one of which
is charged with garnets.         They then give a brief sketch of the
altered condition of the     sedimentary    strata on the western shore of
 the lake Onega, where they are pierced by masses of greenstone and
 trappean conglomerate.
     A few words explain how the Waldai Hills, the great watershed
 of Central Russia, afford the best means of reading off the succes
 sion of the older strata.       The rivers Msta, Wolkoff, Siass, &c.,
 which flow from the south to the north, having short courses, neces
 sarily occupy deeper rents, and therefore expose on their banks
 better sections than those streams, which, descending on the other
 side of the crest, glide along on a very slightly inclined plane to the
 south.      By examining the banks of the north-flowing rivers, the
 older formations were found to succeed each other in the following
 ascending    order:—
      1. Silurian Rocks.-The oldest sedimentary deposits of Russia
 (those on which St. Petersburgh is situated) are clays, sandstone,
 limestone and flagstone, which from their position and organic re
  mains are considered the equivalents of the Silurian system of the
  British Isles. The detailed order of these beds was long ago given
  by Strangways; but at the early day when he wrote, the study of
  organic remains was not sufficiently advanced to enable him to de
  termine the exact place of these beds in the geological series, nor to
  point out their true relations to the adjacent masses.       Many of the
  fossils have since been described     by  the native authors, Pander and
  Eichwald, and recently some very characteristic forms by M. de
  Buch.
      The Silurian deposits consist in ascending order of blue clay, inter
  mediate grit, and overlying limestone, &c.       In the first of these no
  organic remains have yet been found; and the intermediate sand
   stone or grit is alone distinguished by a remarkable form unknown
  in western Europe     (the Ungulite), which the authors consider to be
  nearly allied to Orthis.     They likewise discovered in this grit one
   small shell   resembling   a Pecten.    In the limestones, and certain
   overlying flagstones first described on this occasion, organic remains
   abound; and they agree well in the leading characters on which the
   Silurian system was established, viz. that the forms of Trilobite,

492                         Geological Society.
Orthoceratite, and Orthis are distinct from the types of the overly
ing members of the palaeozoic series.
   The most prevalent fossils are the Orthoceratites vaginatus, Asa
phus expansus, Illanus crassicauda, the peculiar Crinoidean Sphero
nites (allied to the Ischadites of the Upper Silurian rocks), and a
vast profusion of many species of Orthis. Although, upon the whole,
the Silurian fossils of Russia differ more than those of Sweden from
British species of the same age (as might indeed be expected from
their more remote distance), certain shells are identical with those
published from England; among which are enumerated, Leptaena
depressa (L. rugosa, Dalm.), Leptana sericea, Lingula Lewisii, Orthis
canalis (O. elegantula, Dalm.), &c.; and according to M. Eichwald,
two or three species of Trilobites".
    With the exception of some very trivial dislocations in the low
hills south of St. Petersburgh, the Silurian rocks are so uniformly
horizontal, that in the fine quarries on the banks of the Wolkoff, the
authors were able to prove a difference of 2° or 3° to the S.S.E.
only by pouring water on the surface of the rocks.
    These Silurian deposits occupy the islands of Öland, Gothland, &c.
in the Baltic, and trend along the shores of Esthland in a broad
band from W.S.W. to E.N.E., till they are lost under vast heaps of
granitic detritus between the lakes Ladoga and Onega.            Near the
latter, these deposits are deflected to the north, and there meet with
great ridges of trappean rocks, which run from N.N.W. to S.S.E.
In that region all the deposits are in a metamorphic condition; the
limestones present no distinct traces of fossils; and the authors ha
ving satisfied themselves that there was no chance of observing any
further evidence of a descending order between such rocks and the
great primarized granitic chain of Scandinavia and Russian Lapland,
the boundary of which they coasted, confined their attention to the
ascending order of the strata, which is clearly exhibited on the banks
of the Wolkoff and at other places.
    2. Old Red, or Devonian System.—That the inferior strata are the
true equivalents of the Silurian system, was determined not only by
 their aspect and fossil contents, but by their being overlaid by other
rocks which are completely identical with the “Old Red System”
of the British Isles, as defined by Mr. Murchisont. This system is
of great extent in Russia.      It passes from Livonia by the lakes of
 Ilmen and the Waldai Hills, and is extended over a vast region to
the N.E., where it constitutes a large portion of the shores of the
White Sea. This system consists of flagstone, clays, marls, corn
stones and sandstones, the whole bearing a considerable resemblance
to some red deposits of the same age in our isles, but differing by
containing copious salt springs and much gypsum.            It was the oc
currence of so much salt and gypsum that led previous writers to
consider these deposits an equivalent of our new red system, which,
   * See Professor Eichwald's work, published since the authors’ visit to
Russia, entitled “Silurische-Schichten-system in Esthland.”

                           Geological Society.                      493
being found to contain the same minerals in the western parts of
Europe, had been even termed by some, the saliferous system. That
the    red deposits (red and green) are, however, the true equivalents
of    our old red sandstone, is demonstrated, not only by order of
superposition, but also by the many organic remains which they
offer. Fishes are the most distinguishing fossils of this great Rus
sian system, and among these are species (notably the Holoptychius
Nobilissimus, Murchison, with the Coccosteus, Diplopterus and Cteno
ptychius of Agassiz), forms which occur in deposits of the same age
in Scotland. The fishes are in abundance, and a work, illustrative
of them, is now preparing by Professor Asmus, of Dörpat, near which
University they abound. The authors have traced these fish-beds
for a great distance, occupying several stages in the system, and
 each stage characterized by peculiar species of ichthyolites.
     The zoological contents of this system are also of great value in
illustrating and confirming the palaeozoic classification proposed by
Messrs. Sedgwick, Murchison and Lonsdale; or in other words, the
evidences found in Russia leave no doubt that the old red and De
vonian systems of rocks are identical. The Orthis subfusiformis, O.
striata, Spirifer calcarata, S. trapezoidalis, Productus caperatus, Te
rebratula prisca (large var.), and Serpula omphaloides, shells distinct
from those of the carboniferous system, but similar to those which
occur in Devonshire, Westphalia, Belgium, and other places (in de
posits which have been shown by these authors to be of the age of
the old red sandstone), are found in Russia in the same beds with the
fossil fishes of the old red sandstone of the British Isles.
     Still more striking, observe the authors, are these cumulative
 proofs, when it is stated, that although in France and Germany
 there are scarcely any lithological equivalents for the British old red
 system, yet, that in extending researches far to the east, this mem
 ber of the series is found to resume very many of the same mineral
 characters which distinguish it in the central and northern parts of
 the British Isles; and then under similar conditions it contains the
 ichthyolites of the British deposits.
     3. Carboniferous System.—In the northern regions of Russia, the
 lower or calcareous part only of the carboniferous system exists,
 which in the Waldai Hills, near Wytegra, on the Onega, and in
 many other places, is seen to overlie the old red sandstone.       The
 inferior beds consist of incoherent sandstones and bituminous shale,
 which sometimes contain thin beds of impure pyritous coal, and im
 pressions of several plants well known in the carboniferous system
 of our own islands. These are surmounted by various bands of
 limestone, the lowest of which only have occasionally some minera
 logical resemblance to the mountain limestone of Western Europe;
 other beds being lithologically undistinguishable from the magne
  sian limestone of England; some from a pisolite; a third and very
 prevalent band of considerable thickness is milk-white, and not more
  compact than the calcaire grossier of Paris.    This white Productus
 limestone was traced by the authors from the neighbourhood of
  Moscow to beyond Archangel (and they ascertained that it ranged

494.                              Geological Society.
far into the country of the Samoiedes), a distance.of not less than
1000 miles. This formation has also a mineral resemblance to chalk,
in being loaded with thin bands of flints, sometimes concretionary,
in which shells and corals occur. Associated with this formation,
on the banks of the Dwina, about 200 wersts above Archangel, and
south of Süsskaia, are splendid bedded masses of white gypsum,
which, for many miles, present at a little distance all the appear
ance of white limestone *.    With these grand gypseous deposits, in
which are occasionally large concretions, two or three thin bands of
limestone alternate, in one of which the authors detected fossil shells
(Avicula) which are new to them. Other peculiar bands near Ust
Vaga, which are rather higher in the series, contain a Productus
approaching to P. scabriculus, with Pectens and Corals.
   The carboniferous limestone of Russia is highly fossiliferous, and
from the normal and unaltered condition of most of the beds, the
fossils are generally in an excellent state of preservation. Among
them are many well-known British species, the lower beds being
distinguished by the large Productus hemisphericus so well known
in the same lower beds of England and Scotland; and the white
beds being loaded with many of the species published by Fischer,
Phillips and Sowerby, such as Productus Martini, P. punctatus, San
guinolaria sulcata, Spirifer Mosquensis, Cardium aleforme, Cidaris
vetustus, together with the abundant and characteristic Russian coral,
Chaetites radians (found, according to Mr. Lonsdale, in the carbo
niferous limestone of Bristol, &c.), and the Lithostrition floriformis,
one of the most characteristic fossils of the English carboniferous
limestone, &c.
   Owing to its mineral aspect, the age of this rock had, till within
the last year, been misunderstood; but Colonel Helmersen having
observed its position in the Waldai Hills and          association with        its
certain beds     coal, and having ascertained the nature
                  of                                          the fossils             of

Trias of German geologists, the authors reserve their opinions on
such details until they have accomplished a tour to the Ural Moun
tains, on the western flanks of which they hope to detect the evi
dences required; it being very difficult to trace the exact sequence
in the flat and obscure regions over which they followed these de
posits to so wide an extent.
    Oolitic or Jurassic Series.—Certain rocks of the oolitic series have
been long known to exist in the centre of Russia, and some of the
fossils of this series were sent to England by Mr. Strangways.
   The beds of black shale which rest at once on the great red forma
tion along the banks of the Volga, between Kostroma and Nijnii
Novogorod, belong unquestionably to the middle oolite, as they con
tain Ammonites and Belemnites, closely approaching, if not identical in
species with those of the Oxford clay and “Kelloway Rock” of Smith.
Other fossils found near Jelatma, Kacimof and Moscow exhibit
close relations to the fauna of the Lias as well as to that of the mid
dle and lower oolite.      Having examined a suite of specimens from
Moscow, Professor Phillips confirms the views of the authors, who
are disposed to think that the middle and lower oolite, as well as
the Lias, are all represented in Central Russia simply by beds of
black shale with subsidiary courses of oolitic marlstone, concretions,
&c. Near Moscow these shales repose directly and conformably
upon the carboniferous limestone. Among the fossils of the group
on the Volga and the Okka are Ammonites flexistria, A. Gulielmi,
 A. Königii, A. sublavis, with Gryphaea Maccullochii 2, &c. Among
the fossils from Moscow are Ammonites of many species, some of
which are figured by Fischer, others are described by Professor
Phillips, for this memoir. Belemnites absolutus (B. sulcatus, Miller);
Serpula tetragona, Sow.; Amphidesma? donaciforme,           Phill. ; Lima
proboscidea?, Sow.; Pecten Fisherii, N.S., Inoceramus dubius, Sow.;
 (P. rugosus, Fischer) Terebratula serrata, Sow.; T. acuta, Phill.
 These forms characterize the lower oolite and lias of the British Isles.
    Ferruginous Sand.—The shales of the oolitic series are covered
 by ferruginous sands, occasionally green, which contain large flat
 tened concretions of grit (the Moscow millstones); but never having
 observed fossils in this rock, the authors are unwilling as yet to
 hazard an opinion regarding          its
                                    age. With the exception          of
                                                                    certain
 very recent deposits, these grits are the youngest solid strata          in
                                                                        the

    Chalk.—The cretaceous system          largely developed
                                              is               the south,

 near Simbirsk, and    in the Crimea; but on this occasion the authors
 did not extend their tour       to
                                the chalk districts.
    Tertiary Deposits.-The white shelly limestone           Crimea, and

that the great masses of superficial detritus, whether clays, sands or
 blocks, which cover so very large an area of the northern region,
 were all referable to one epoch (diluvian) in which the bones of
 great extinct quadrupeds were also imbedded. The duration of their
journey was not sufficient to enable the authors to make many di
 stinctions of age between these different masses; but they have
 commenced this division by the discovery of beds of clay and sand
 on the banks of the Dwina and Vaga, upwards of 200 miles south
of the White Sea, which contain twenty-two species of shells, many
of which still preserve their colours, and which, having been referred
to Dr. Beck, of Copenhagen, have been pronounced by him to be all
of modern northern species.           Mr. Lyell states that they are identi
cal with the Uddevalla group described by him in Sweden.                         Mr.

land.    Near Nijnii Novogorod large blocks of a very peculiar trap
pean conglomerate were detected, which had been derived from a
rock in situ N. of Petrazowodsk, a distance of nearly 600 miles. In
endeavouring to account for the immense distances to which these
blocks had been transported, the authors expressed their belief that
they had been floated in former icebergs, which breaking loose from
ancient glaciers, which they suppose may have eristed in Lapland and
the adjacent tracts, were dislodged upon an elevation of the northern
chain, and impelled southwards into the sea of that period, in which
the post pleiocene shells, to which allusion has been made, were ac
cumulated. In the relation of the blocks to the sea shells, they con
ceive that Central Russia presents an exact parallel (though on a
much grander scale) to the phaenomena described by one of the au
thors in the central counties of England, where a similar collocation
was accounted for, by supposing that the northern blocks were borne
thither in vessels of ice, which in melting dropped them upon what
was then a sea bottom *.
   Glacial Action.—After alluding to the works of Sefströmt and
Bötlingk upon the supposed “ diluvial” currents of Scandinavia and
Lapland, as evidenced by the parallel striae and polishing of the sur
face of the hard rocks of these regions, the authors describe the most
southerly of the scratches, which came under their notice near Pe
trazowodsk, on the lake Onega, no such markings having anywhere
been observed in Central Russia.         They then examine the applica
bility of the glacial theory, as proposed by M. Agassiz, to the tracts
of Russia under review. Starting from what they conceive to be an
axiom, that the advance of every modern glacier depends upon the
superior altitude of the ground behind           they show, that       it,
                                                                        certain
parallel striae, observed                     by
                                M. Bötlingk, and others noted            them                         byif
selves, are              to

such bodies must often have been propelled from lower                    higher                       to
levels.   For the proofs       this they referof    the eastern sides       to

an incredibly enormous advancing front of many hundred miles in
length !
     Without pretending to offer a complete solution of so difficult a
problem, and after stating that many additional and even experi
mental researches are required in relation to the power of water,
 drift, and ice, they cannot avoid suggesting as a probable explana
 tion of the chief phaenomena in the North of Russia, that currents
 strongly determined in given directions by the elevation of the
 northern continental masses, might dislodge and set in movement
 icefloes and detritus, which, grating upon the bottom of a sea, may
 have produced the parallel striae. They are the more confirmed in
 this hypothesis, by the fact, that the longer axes of the lakes and
 stony ridges of Northern Russia have generally the same direction;
 so that the supposed icebergs and land detritus would necessarily be
 borne in that direction. By adopting this view, the existence of the
 post pleiocene shells of the Vaga and the Dwina, and their relations
  to the overlying drift from the North, are in harmony; and whilst
  admitting so much of the glacial theory as to allow, that in former
  days glaciers probably advanced further to the South and occupied
  many insulated tracts, and to a much greater extent than at the
  present day, the geologist, they conceive, is alone called upon to
  define and limit the area of land in Scandinavia and Lapland, once
  covered with solid ice, in doing which he must of course exclude
  from such agency the vast countries now covered by erratic blocks,
  which he can demonstrate were deposited upon the bottom of the sea.
      Angular block-ridges on lake and river Banks.-On the western
  shore of the great lake of Onega, the attention of the authors was
  directed, by Colonel Armstrong*, to three parallel ridges of large
  angular blocks of hard grit (old red sandstone                        *),
                                                                which occur                    at
  heights, varying from           2030 or        to
                                           150 feet           or

 of    the water.    As these blocks were identical           composition with
  the solid   subjacent  rock, and also   quite  angular,      was it inonce evi    at
   dent that they had not been drifted, but simply rent from the solid
   rock which forms that side           of

and overlaid by the upper carboniferous limestone.                 They also
 express their belief that the millstone grits which have been alluded
to near Moscow must be considered of tertiary age, as similar beds
 overlie true chalk.
    Mr. Murchison takes this opportunity, in the name of his friend
 M. de Verneuil and himself, of recording his sense of the value of
the additional data which are due to the labours of Baron de Mey
 endorf and his associates, and trusts that after an exploration of the
flanks of the Ural, and other tracts near Orenburg and in the South,
 all the chief facts will have been obtained for the construction of a
 general geological map of Russia in Europe.
    Count Keyserling, who has traced the shales with Ammonites
 near Ust-Sisolsk (N. Lat. 61°, E. Long. 51°), has indeed contri
 buted most powerfully to these results, both by his patient obser
 vation, sound knowledge of natural history, and by his barometrical
 admeasurement of heights,         a point of great geological importance
 in those central parts of the country where the strata are not de
 ranged. By one of his observations, it appears, that the younger
 pleiocene deposits on the Dwina, which he detected in company
 with M. de Verneuil and Mr. Murchison, are about 150 feet above
 the White Sea. Count Keyserling, now at St. Peterburgh, will
 accompany the authors in their journey to the Ural Mountains this
 summer.—March 26.

  LecTURE        I. Thursday,
                           November 11, 1841.-Introduction:      con
nexion of the   subject with that of the course on Igneous Geology
delivered last year; the operation of Heat on certain kinds of matter,
whether in Meteors or in the crust of the earth, produces crystalline
mineral aggregates or rocks.     History of our knowledge respecting
Meteorites or Meteoric rocks.     The fall from the heavens of stones
and blocks of iron recorded      by the historians and naturalists of
Classical Antiquity and the Middle Ages.      The statements of those
and subsequent writers disbelieved in more recent times; but their
truth demonstrated, and the descent of such bodies from Igneous
Meteors established as a fact in science early in the present cen
tury. Fall of a large stone in Yorkshire in 1795—of a shower of
stones from a Meteor, near Benares, in India, in 1798—of a shower
of several thousand stones at L'Aigle, in Normandy, in 1803.
   LecTURE II. Nov. 18.-Phaenomena        of those Meteors which as
sume the form of Balls of Fire, and are thence called Igneous Meteors
and Fire-Balls.       The Meteor which passed over Great Britain in
1783 taken as an      example.       Figure and aspect of Igneous Meteors
in    general, with   pictorial  illustrations.    Their light more intense
than that from     any  other source     except  the Sun: their velocity equal
to that of the     planets   and    relatively   much greater.   Their height
above the Earth's surface—their             explosions—the   luminous tracks
they leave in the sky.          Some throw down red-hot stones, others
blocks of iron.      Fall of a shower of stones from a great Meteor
which     appeared  in North America in 1807. More recent instances
in India, Russia, Germany, the British Islands, the South Sea Islands,
Brazil, and Southern Africa. The most recent authenticated                    in
stance—that of a large stone which fell at Château-Renard, near Or
leans, on the 12th of June, 1841. Other Phaenomena attending the
fall of Meteorites described and illustrated.
     LECTURE III. Nov. 25.—The nature of Meteoric Stones, their
 mineralogical characters and constitution, and chemical composition,
 illustrated by specimens. The immense blocks of metallic iron, some
 many tons in weight, found on the surface of the earth in various
 countries, especially in Africa and America,           allcast down    by  Me
 teors.    Observed fall    of such       block,
                                          a        inHungary, in  1751. The
 peculiar nature      ofMeteoric Iron illustrated.       Meteoric stones and
 iron form one class       or
                            series    of bodies, collectively termed METEo
 Rites,     Meteoric rocks. Some meteorites mineralogically identical
           or
 with certain volcanic rocks: these two classes         of rocks still perfectly
 distinct: both        igneous origin, but the production
                      of                                       of  the one at
 tended     by meteoric phaenomena           the atmosphere
                                              in              or the planeta
                                  of by
 spaces,   and   of   the other   volcanic phaenomena within the Earth's
 crust.     Final illustrations    the peculiar characters    of
                                                             Meteorites.
   Lecture IV.         Dec. 2.--The problem       the origin
                                                   of           of

 discussed.   Examination of some of the hypotheses by which its so
 lution has been attempted, and in which meteorites have been sup
 posed to originate in the Earth or its atmosphere—the volcanos of the
 Moon—other planets—the Sun—the planetary spaces—more di
stant parts of the Universe—to be themselves minute planets or sa
tellites, fragments of planets which have been destroyed, or matter
preparing for the formation of new worlds.         Relations of this sub
ject to that of the identity or similarity of Fire-Balls and the meteors
called Shooting Stars: recent simultaneous appearance at distant parts
of the globe of showers of shooting stars—their alleged periodicity.
 Manifest connexion between the physical and chemical characters
of Meteorites and the phaenomena which attend their fall; the former
illustrated from the molecular constitution of the stony lavas, in the
flowing state: resulting inferences as to the intimate nature of Igneous
Meteors.     Connexion of this branch of the subject with many im
portant objects of inquiry in Meteorology, Astronomy, and Geology.
Conclusion.
   The illustration of the characters of meteorites from the molecular
constitution of the stony lavas, in the flowing state, to be alluded to
in the concluding lecture, arises from the application to the subject
of Meteorites, of certain considerations derived from Mr. Scrope's
inductions respecting the constitution of lava and the nature of                                    its
apparent fluidity.     have, for the last four years, been

LXXV.     On an ertraordinary Magnetic Disturbance recently
  observed at Greenwich. By G. B. AIRY, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,
  Astronomer Royal”.
ONtraordinary
    the 25th of September of the present year, a most ex
              disturbance of the magnetic instruments was
observed at the Magnetic Observatory attached to the Royal
Observatory of Greenwich.        The disturbed state of        the                      all
instruments attracted the attention      Mr. Glaisher (chief as
                                                     of
          the magnetic department),            early hour     an                        of
                                                       a at
sistant  in                                                   that
day, and       he
              immediately commenced        series    observations      of
on all the instruments,                at
                             short intervals.   After    time, the           a
disturbance became                so
                          small that the extraordinary observa
tions were discontinued;   but again increased, and observa
                                             it
tions were again immediately made with           the instruments,all
and repeated     rapidly
                       as      was possible for one observer
                                       as   it                                                to
do so. But for the promptitude and judgement displayed by
Mr. Glaisher on this occasion, the record this disturbance,      of
unprecedented      this magnetic latitude, would probably have
                        in
been lost. The    following statement will give       idea     the      an              of
magnitude         of
               the disturbance:--that within eight minutes                                    of
time, the declination needle changed                       its
                                              position more than
24° (having passed      both directions the range

the declination          needle                of the needle
                                   increase as the north end
moves towards the east, and that the reading for the astro
nomical meridian is 269° 51'45" nearly; that the increasing
readings of the vertical-force magnetometer imply increasing
vertical force, one division being equal to 0-000471 of the
        j.
whole vertical force; and that the increasing readings of the
horizontal-force magnetometer imply increasing horizontal
force, one division being equal to 0.002214 of the whole ho
rizontal force.
   Early in the morning of Sept. 25, the needles were in an agi
tated state.   During #. appearance of an aurora, additional
observations were taken; and the declination needle in less
than three hours traversed an arc of 34'. After this the needles
were in a tolerably quiet state, and extraordinary observations
Were
   The observation  at 10" a.m. showing a change of 17' of
arc from the previous reading, at 8" a.m., extra observations
were again resumed, and continued till 11" a.m.; nothing re
markable appearing during this time, they were again discon
tinued.
   At 2" p.m., Göttingen  mean time, it was evident that                                      all
the needles were affected           by
                           some unusual cause    disturbance,        of
and incessant observations were     once        at

struments being observed successively,    quickly     one ob

subsequently Messrs. Dunkin and Paul. From this time       the                           to
 discontinuance        the observations two persons were constantly
                         of
 engaged, one taking the observations with the vertical-force
 magnetometer, the other, those                of
                                         the declination needle and
of   the horizontal-force magnetometer.         About       40" p.m.,     2"

                   the needles became     very peculiar;   the vibra

  After this great disturbance the irregularities were still very
great; the horizontal-force and the vertical-force magneto
meters partook of similar disturbances throughout.              With a
few  trifling exceptions,  an increase  of  force  in one   was accom
panied with an increase of force in the other, and so also with
respect to the decrease of force.
   The declination magnet has certainly, however, one great
deflexion, in which the others have no share; that which oc
curred between 8h 54m 40s and 3h 55m 0°, where an arc of
1°12' was described in 20°. Nothing similar, at this time, is
shown by either of the other needles.
   In addition to the observations contained in this account,
ample and abundant observations were taken to obtain every
variation of the vertical force, and also observations of the
declination and horizontal-force magnetometer, sufficient to
show every great change and nearly              the small ones, until

   514       Mr. R. C. Campbell    on the Ferrocyanides.
   that, heated in contact with the air, the products of the de
  composition are very different. The cyanide of potassium
  takes oxygen from the air, and is thereby converted into cya
  nate of potash, while the cyanide of iron is decomposed, con
  verting the iron into an oxide. The absorption of oxygen is
  caused by the presence of the cyanide of iron, for cyanide of
  potassium, heated by itself in contact with the air, does not
  become changed into cyanate of potash.            I  believe that a
  process for cyanate of potash may be founded on the above
  observation, preferable to the common one with oxide of
  manganese; for it has been proved that this oxide is not
  essential in the process, and it not unfrequently happens that
  a large quantity of the cyanide of potassium is converted into
  carbonate of potash.     Sometimes also a little manganese dis
  solves along with the cyanate.
     For the preparation of this salt, then, without the use of
 manganese, the powdered and dried prussiate of potash is
 heated almost to redness, in a flat iron vessel, with constant
 stirring of the melted mass. Some ammonia is evolved,
 which results from the action of the moisture of the air, for
                                  º
 the substance itself contains no hydrogen.       The melted mass
 should be taken out with an iron       spatula,   allowed to cool,
 reduced to powder, and again fused; because the melting
 cyanate of potash is apt to             little bits of the yellow
 prussiate from the action of the air.     If  the heating be pro
 perly conducted, not a particle of cyanide of potassium will
 be formed.      The cyanate of potash is dissolved out with hot
 alcohol filtered and crystallized. The undecomposed prus
 siate of potash remains undissolved.
     The double salt of ferroprussiate of potash and lime acts
 under heat exactly like the ferroprussiate of potash itself.
 Well dried and set on fire, it continues to burn, until the
alkaline and earthy cyanides are converted into cyanates, and
the iron into oxide. The reason that the double salt con
tinues to burn is to be found in the porous state of the mass,
which offers no obstacle to the free access of air; whereas
the yellow prussiate alone fuses, and prevents the progress of
the combustion.
    The ferrocyanide of zinc, which always contains some ferro
prussiate of potash in chemical combination, likewise con
tinues to burn, and affords cyanate of potash and the oxides
of the   metals.
    When the double salt of potash and lime is heated in the
air as above mentioned, and then dissolved in water, the solu
tion possesses the remarkable property of becoming pink in
the sun's rays, and again becoming colourless in darkness.

                 Mr. R. C. Campbell                     on the Ferrocyanides.                                515
Neither cyanate of lime nor cyanate of potash, together or
singly, or mixed with prussiate of potash, show this reaction.
It is hence probable that this solution owes the above-men
tioned property to the admixture of some foreign substance,
present probably in a very small quantity.    All attempts to
isolate any  such substance were fruitless.
   As the shade of colour in the above solution is exactly that
of a solution of permanganate of potash, the solution and the
substances used were tested for manganese.                   They contained
none. The reactions of this solution too stand in contradiction
with some of those of the permanganates. The presence offer
rocyanide of potassium is essential to the production of the pink
                                                            F.
in the sun's rays, but the action of the same salt on perman
ganate of potash is first to reduce it to the green manganate,
and by further addition of the                          to oxide of manga
nese.      As the prussiate of potash of commerce often contains
traces of sulphocyanide of potassium, the experiments were
repeated with prussiate of potash, that had been washed with
hot alcohol, and by this means                              in
                                                  sulphocyanide removed;
but no difference was observed                 the result.    all                             -

 dissolved in water, shows likewise the same reaction, although
 containing no cyanate of potash.
      Ihave already stated, that the investigation undertaken with
 the view of isolating the colouring substance in these experi
 ments, was without success; nevertheless some observations
 were made which seem to stand in relation to this subject.
    It has often been remarked, that, on adding an acid to the
 solution of the heated double salt, a minute quantity of a red
 dish powder is precipitated.        This powder contains iron; it
 is decolorized     by carbonate of potash, but the colour is not
 reproduced by exposure to the sun.                The solution from
 which this powder has been precipitated, on being saturated
 with alkali, and exposed to the sun's rays, is found not to have
 lost the colouring property.        I suspect that this red powder
is the same as is observed to be precipitated from some speci
 mens of commercial prussiate of potash, on the addition of
 strong acetic acid.      Prussiate of potash is sometimes observed
in commerce of a darker tint than usual, and it is this variety
 which frequently shows the above-mentioned reaction.
    If a solution of cyanide of ammonium be added to a solu
tion of acetate of copper, a compound of copper and cyanogen
is precipitated, not analogous in             its
                                            composition     the cyanide to

which sulphuret of potassium has been added, becomes soon

 rishment, the author states that he has found every structure he has
 examined to arise out of corpuscles having the same appearance as
 the corpuscles of the blood. The following are the tissues which he
 has submitted to actual observation, and which have given the above
 result, namely, the cellular, the nervous, and the muscular; besides
 cartilage, the coats of blood-vessels, several membranes, the tables and
 cells of the epithelium, the pigmentum nigrum, the ciliary processes,
 the crystalline lens itself, and even the spermatozoon and the ovum.
    The author then traces the nucleus of the blood-corpuscle into
 the pus-globule; showing that every stage in the transition presents
 a definite figure. The formation of the pus-globule out of the nucleus
 of the blood-corpuscle is referable to the same process, essentially, as
 that by means of which the germinal spot comes to fill the germinal
 vesicle in the ovum. This process, which, in a former memoir, he
 had traced in the corpuscles of the blood, he now shows to be uni
 versal, and nowhere more obvious than in the reproduction of the
 tables of the epithelium. The epithelium-cylinder seems to be con
 stituted, not by coalescence of two objects previously single, as has
 been supposed, but by division of a previously single object. Certain
 objects, called by the author primitive discs, exhibit an inherent con
 tractile power, both when isolated, and when forming parts of a
 larger object; an incipient epithelium-cylinder having been observed
 by him to revolve by this means. Molecular motions are sometimes
 discernible within corpuscles of the blood. The author has no
 ticed young blood-corpuscles exhibiting motions, comparable to the
 molecular, and moving through a considerable space; and he has
 met with the nuclei of blood-corpuscles endowed with cilia, revol
ving, and performing locomotion. In his first paper on the Corpuscles
 of the Blood, he described certain instantaneous changes in form
which he had observed in blood-corpuscles, and afterwards expressed
 his belief, that these changes were referable to contiguous cilia,
 although he had not been able to discern any such cilia.       He now
 states that subsequent observation inclines him to think that these
 changes in form arise from some inherent power, distinct from the
 motions occasioned by cilia.      The primitive disc, just mentioned,
 seems to    correspond,   in some instances, with the “cytoblast” of
 Schleiden.     Thus the very young corpuscle of the blood is a mere
 disc; but the older corpuscle is a cell. The author minutely de
 scribes the mode of origin of the pigmentum nigrum; showing that
 it arises in a similar manner in the tail of the tadpole, and in the
 choroid coat of the eye. He had before described the Graafian vesicle
 as formed by the addition of a covering to the previously-existing
ovisac : this covering, he afterwards stated, becomes the corpus
luteum.      He now confirms these observations, with the addition,
 that it is the blood-corpuscles entering into the formation of the
covering of the ovisac, which give origin to the corpus luteum.
The spermatozoon appears to be composed of a few coalesced discs.
The fibres of the crystalline lens are not elongated cells, as supposed
by Schwann ; but coalesced cells, at first arranged in the same man
ner as beads in a necklace.                 -

   The author concludes with the following recapitulation :-1. The
nucleus of the corpuscle of the blood admits of being traced into the
pus-globule.   2. The various structures arise out of corpuscles ha
ving the same appearance, form, and size as corpuscles of the blood.
3. The corpuscles having this appearance, and giving origin to
structures, are propagated by division of their nuclei. 4. The cor
puscles of the blood, also, are propagated by division of their nuclei.
5. The minuteness of the young blood-corpuscles is sometimes
extreme ; and they are to be found in parts usually considered as
not being permeable by red blood.
   In a postscript, the author adds, that blood found in the heart
immediately after death by bleeding, presents incessant alterations
in the position of corpuscles. Among these, when single corpus
                              its                                                           a

 which depend on the alternate atmospheres, and neutral spaces of

    “On the Organs of Reproduction, and on the Development of
 the Myriapoda.”       By George Newport, Esq. Communicated by
 P. M. Roget, M.D., Sec. R.S.
    The author commences his paper by stating that great interest
 attaches to the study of the Myriapoda, from the already known fact
 that their mode of development, by an increase in the number of
 segments, is directly the reverse of that of true insects in which
 the development of the perfect individual is accompanied by an ap
 parent diminution in the number of these parts.      He remarks, that
 although the development of the Myriapoda has already been ex
 amined by several eminent naturalists, such as Degeer, Savi, Gervais,
 and Waga, some of the most important facts relating to it have,
nevertheless, escaped their notice, and he proposes, therefore, to lay
before the Society the result of his own investigations on this sub
ject, and also his examinations of the organs of reproduction.
    The paper is divided into four sections. In the first, the author
describes the organs of reproduction, and shows that the parts de
scribed by Treviranus, both in the male and female Julus, are only
the efferential ducts in the male, and the oviduct in the female ;
that in the former there are developed, from the sides of the efferen
tial ducts, a large number of sacs, the structure of which he de
scribes, and states his opinion that these are the proper secretory
organs in the male, but remarks that he has not been able to follow
out the organs to their fullest extent. In the female, he shows that
the oviduct described by Treviranus is covered by an immense num
ber of ovisacs, each secreting only a single ovum; that many hun
dreds of these exist around the duct, a large proportion of which
never reach maturity, being retarded in their growth by the deve
lopment of others immediately around them; and that the ova, when
matured, are passed from the ovisacs into the duct, and are then all
deposited at one time. He adverts especially to the remarkable condi
tion of the female oviduct being a single organ, throughout the
greater part ofits   extent, but having
                                     a    double outlet; and showsits
analogy in    the internal portion
                                of    the organs
                                               to       of
                                                     those   some in

       Reproduction and Development               of the Myriapoda.                  521
sects, and   in its double outlet to the Crustacea and Arachnida.                     He
also institutes a comparison between the structure of the male and
female organs in this Myriapod, which, from their simplicity, admira
bly illustrate the uniformity of origin of these structures; more espe
cially the analogy between the ovisacs in the female and the caeca in
the male, and also their conformity in the absence, in the latter, of se
parate vesiculae seminales, and, in the former, of spermatheca.
   The second section is occupied by a short account of the structure
of the ovum, in which the author observes the germinal vesicle and
macula.     He notices especially the presence of the yelk in the ear
liest stages of development, together with the vesicle and the mem
branes of the ovum at a later period, as showing in this low form of
animal the conformity of structure and laws with those which pre
vail in the higher forms.
   In the third section, the author speaks of the deposition of the
ova, and of the habits of the species, as observed in specimens col
lected and preserved by him for that purpose. These habits he re
gards as particularly curious.     The female excavates for herself a
burrow, by digging with her mandibles in the soil, which she has
previously moistened with a fluid, supplied, as the author believes, by
 her immense salivary glands. With this she forms a soft pellet, which
she removes from the burrow with her mandibles and anterior legs;
and thence, after being brought to the top of the hole, it is passed
on to the next pair, and by these on to the next in succession, until
it is entirely removed out of the way; after which, she deposits her
eggs and closes the burrow with moistened clay. Great difficulty was
experienced in preserving the eggs during the observations, from
the circumstance that their shell is soft, and dries quickly when ex
posed to the air. To avoid this, the author had recourse to the plan
of inclosing the eggs in a glass tube, filled with clay, and closed
with a cork; the eggs being placed in a cell next to the glass.
   The fourth section, which constitutes the most important part of
the paper, gives the history of the evolution of the embryo. The
process is divided by the author into different periods.        After a few
observations on the earlier changes of the egg, and the proof that they
consist in an alteration in the size and appearance of the cells out of
which the embryo is formed, he states his having observed that the
egg bursts at the end of twenty-five days, by means of a fissure along
the dorsal surface, as described by Savi and Waga; and that, in oppo
sition to the remarks of Degeer, the young Julus, as first stated by
 Savi, is perfectly apodal. The author has also discovered a singular
fact, entirely overlooked by      all
                                   who have attended      the development
                                                              to

 embryo, and        completely inclosed       shut sac, which terminates

 not effected by any effort of          own, but       its

sandstone, Sir Philip Egerton says, it would be difficult, if not im
possible, to define the proper limits of these formations.       The new
red sandstone of     England,  the equivalent  of the trias, presents this
difficulty, every endeavour to find the muschelkalk having failed;
and therefore geologists are compelled either to consider the keuper,
the upper member of the trias, to be also wanting, or to be merged
in the mass of alternating marls and sandstones comprising the new
red series.    Lithological structure, consequently, being of no value,
palaeontological evidence, the author says, becomes of great import
ance. The beautiful results arrived at by Mr. Owen respecting the
Batrachian remains found near Warwick, tend, Sir Philip Egerton
states, to render the existence of the keuper extremely probable,
though a specific identification with the analogous fossils of the
German keuper has not been ascertained. The only instances on
record of muschelkalk fishes found in Great Britain, are scales from
the Bone Bed at Aust Cliff, and referred by Professor Agassiz to
 Gyrolepis Albertii and G. tenuistriatus, common continental muschel
kalk fishes. This bed it is well known occurs at the base of the lias,
and rests conformably on the green and red marls of the new red
sandstone.      A thin stratum replete with remains of saurians and
ichthyolites occupies a similar stratigraphical position near Axmouth;
and Prof. Agassiz, during his visit to England in the autumn of 1840,
identified in a series of specimens obtained by Miss Mary Anning,
one Placoid, two Lepidoid, and one Sauroid fish, with well-known
muschelkalk species. He also determined the existence of fifteen other
species from this deposit, none of which have been yet noticed in
the continental Triassic group.       Two, if not three, of the above
muschelkalk ichthyolites are also found at Aust; and a comparison
of the Aust and Axmouth species gives five as common to the two
localities, twelve as confined to the former, and two to the latter.
The only conclusion, Sir Philip Egerton states, which he feels justi
fied in advancing from the facts adduced in this communication                    is,
that the beds     inquestion, hitherto considered       belonging

      A  letter, dated Helsingförs, January 5th, 1841, from Professor
    Nordenskiöld to Mr. Lyell, “On Furrowed Rocks in Finland,” was
    then read.
       In consequence of Sefström's observations on the lines which
    traverse the surface of the Scandinavian mountains", Professor Nor
    denskiöld has been induced to attend to similar phaenomena in Fin
    land, and he states, that he has noticed lines on almost all moun
    tains from Lapland to the south of Finland, ranging with few devia
    tions from N.N.W. and N. to S.S.E. and S. On the highest cliffs
    they are seldom visible on account of the surface being worn, but
    wherever the rocks are overlaid with sand and earth the lines are
    easily discovered on the covering being removed.      Professor Nor
    denskiöld has likewise discovered shallow furrows, from three to six
    feet wide, on the surface of the north and south sand-ridges or pla
    teaux which separate the water systems of Finland.     He has traced
    them for more than fifty fathoms maintaining the same directions
    as the lines upon the mountains, and he has noticed that they are
    sometimes near each other.     The localities mentioned in the letter
     are—near the church of Kemi; between Antila and Raukula post
     stations on the road from Torneå to Uleåberg; and at a place in
     Carelia, some miles from the iron-works at St. Anna in Suojerfoi
    parish.
        In searching for iron-ore near Helsingförs, a shaft twenty feet
    deep was sunk in alluvial soil; and Prof. Nordenskiöld observed on
    the surface of some fragments which had been blasted from a rock
    at the bottom of the shaft, similar lines to those which occur on the
    mountains, but he was unable to determine their direction, the exca
    vation being filled with water and mud. As the rock was twenty
    feet below the surface of the water in the Finnish Gulf, this fact,
    Professor Nordenskiöld says, proves that the lines which traverse
    the mountains exist also at least twenty feet beneath the level of
    the Gulf. Another phaenomenon of this nature lately observed by
    him is a furrowed rock of gneiss, not far from Porkala, but six
    wersts from the shore.   The rock is flat and not very large, and at
    the height of nine feet above the medium level of the water, is one
    of the round holes called by the Swedes, “Giants' Pots,” but of an
    unusually large size, being about three feet by two and a half feet.
    It was somewhat larger within, and sixteen feet deep. Professor
    Nordenskiöld had the water and detritus which it contained taken
    out, and found at the bottom numerous perfectly rounded stones
    mixed up with the mud. The sides of the Pot were exactly ground,
    and as resplendent as gneiss can be made.        At the east side the
    brim was somewhat rounded, and well marked with a number of
    large, flat, east and west furrows, showing, in Professor Nordens
    kiöld's opinion, “that the stones and waves had on that side driven
                                     if its
    in the brim at the time of    formation.”     On the opposite side the
    margin was quite sharp,        the rock had been broken away since
                                    as

 the cavity had been ground. On the surface of the rock were north
 and south lines similar to those on the mountains, and they inter
 sected the east and west furrows mentioned above; Professor Nord
 enskiöld therefore infers that the lines were made subsequent to the
 formation of the Giants' Pot.
    With respect to the level of the water in the Finnish Gulf, the
following changes are shown to have taken place. On the little
island of Fussaro, some miles from Hangövdd, and in the open sea,
a mark which was made in the year 1754 is now twenty Swedish
(19% English) inches above the medium height of the water; an
other which was cut in 1800 is about nine inches; and a third
excavated in 1821 is about five Swedish inches.      At St. Petersburg
and Cronstadt it is believed that no      change has taken place since
 1645.
    A letter, addressed   to Dr. Buckland by Mr. Thomas Bailey, “On
the Gravel     Deposits  in the Neighbourhood of Basford,” was next
read.
    The parish of Basford is situated in a valley ranging nearly north
and south where it enters the great Trent vale.        On  the eastern
boundary, which is a very elevated district, commences    an extensive
argillaceous bed containing comparatively few pebbles;     on the west
are the coal-fields of Radford and Bilborough; on the north-west
 occurs the magnesian limestone which extends beyond Mansfield;
and on the north is the elevated tract or ancient forest of Hurwood,
occupied by great accumulations of gravel and sand, agreeing in cha
racter with those in the neighbourhood of Basford. In the midst of
the valley in which Basford is situated are lower ridges of hills,
mostly ranging in the direction of the valley, and containing beds of
gravel quite as thick (two to eight feet), and interspersed with boul
ders as large as those found in the hollows or lower parts.        Mr.
Bailey is of opinion that none of these deposits were accumulated by
fluviatile action, or by any uniform agent operating during long pe
riods, but by a tumultuous commotion, when the surface of the earth
was in a different state to that which now prevails with respect to
hill and dale—the deposits being very unequal in thickness, con
torted in position, and composed of materials very irregularly asso
ciated as regards nature and size. The transport of the drift in one
direction, the author says, appears to have been sometimes checked
by a rush from an opposite point, by which means the materials were
forced into ridges having an axis of loose sand.        Some of these
ridges, he conceives, may have been produced by intermediate hol
lows having been scooped out, and subsequently filled with gravel.
    Mr. Bailey does not offer any positive opinion respecting the di
rection by which the detritus arrived at its present situation, but he
thinks it could not have been transported from the S. or S.E., as it
contains no pebbles of Charnwood and Mount Sorrel sienite, or of
lias or lias-fossils, or of gypsum ; nor from any point between S.W.
and N.W., on account of the absence of mountain-limestone pebbles,
and as the fragments of chert which it contains differ from the chert
of the Derbyshire strata. Had the drift come from the west, he

states, it ought to contain detritus from the coal-fields which occupy
the whole district between Basford and the Derbyshire limestone
hills, whereas he has found only one or two small pieces of what
might be called jet. He has also never obtained any specimens of
magnesian limestone, though that formation occupies almost the
whole country to the north-west and north.                   Mr. Bailey therefore
suggests, that the gravel was drifted from a district between the
north and east points.
     The mass of these deposits consists of fragments of coarse quartz
ose rock, frequently tinged in a great variety of ways.                    Many of
the pebbles of sandstone are traversed by white veins which project
above the general surface : other specimens are rolled portions of
 quartzose conglomerates, and the greater part of the materials com
 posing them appear to have been much worn, before they were                                              in
 closed in the cement; but some of the fragments have sustained very
 little abrasion by removal from their native bed, preserving                     the               all

                    recent fractures.     Small masses         iron-ore are not
 unfrequent occurrence.           Mr. Bailey has seen only one specimen
 mica-slate.      Many fragments           trap are found
                                              of                these deposits and

 some  of    them are      considerable size, constituting the largest blocks
                            of

     No freshwater or marine shells have been discovered in these

     Organic remains derived from other deposits are very rare, with

source. The next spring was encountered at the depth of 235 feet,
in  a bed of white sand; it flowed six feet higher, and was more
abundant than any of the preceding.         The spring which issued
from the bottom bed was still stronger, and rose 2% feet higher than
any of the others, or to within 24 feet of the surface. The lowest
pipe introduced into the boring had a diameter of three inches; it
was worked with “two-lift pumps,” the section-pipe of each being
two inches bore, for nine hours incessantly, during which 25,728
gallons were discharged.      An analysis of the water was made by
Mr. J. H. Cooper, and a gallon was found to contain 94 grains of
solid matter, or 4} grains of oxide of iron, the remainder consisting
principally of common salt with a small admixture of sulphate and
carbonate of lime, and a trace of oxide of manganese.
   At Hamworthy, near Poole, another boring has been made, within
100 yards of the harbour, to the depth of 314 feet, through a
series of beds similar to those penetrated at Longfleet, and a similar
series of springs was tapped; but as the boring was commenced at
80 feet lower level, or only 10 feet above low tide in Poole Harbour,
all the springs flowed over the surface, though not strongly.    This
boring was abandoned         account                        on

  A   letter, dated Glasgow, January 16, 1841, from Mr. Craig               Dr.                                        to

pebbles with fragments          coal-measures and overlying till. Similar
                                        of
beds   of  sand occur near Eagleham, twelve miles south               Glasgow;                            of

which ranges through the city. On the other side of the Clyde they
reach as far as Mr. Dixon's iron-works, but further down the river
their thickness is not great. At Mr. Smith's property of Whiteinch
twelve feet of sand overlie thirty of soft clay and sand.
   The bed containing recent shells at the entrance of the Arkleston
Tunnel”, near Paisley, is 80 feet above high-water level; and a simi
lar bed at Port Glasgow is 40 feet. In both instances it is overlaid
by laminated sands similar to those at Toll Cross, and on which the
greater part of the city is built. Their highest level in Glasgow is
about the same as that at Arkleston.
   The boulders are found almost throughout the basin of the Clyde
where denudation has not taken place subsequent to their deposition,
except in the elevated trap districts, where they are very rare; the
only instances mentioned in the paper are the Baker's Reservoir on
the summit of the trap range of Kilpatrick, and Cochney Loch; nor
do they appear on those strata which have been upheaved by trap.
On the side of the road near Cartlane Bridge is an accumulation of
very large primary and transition boulders without till, forming a
kind of escarpment on the brow of a very precipitous bank leading to
the valley of the Tee.   The opposite slope is crowned with beds of
sand. The level of these beds is stated to be 550 feet above the sea.
   Near the source of the Avon is a deposit of sand and gravel 50 feet
thick; and similar beds occur at Greenock Mains, on the Ayr road
from Muirk Kirk. West of these deposits, on White Haugh Water,
are enormous beds of till.    Boulders or fragments of compact flesh
coloured   felspar and reddish porphyries are very rare in this district,
but are common in the higher parts of Lanark and Ayr, where these
rocks form dykes or beds in old red sandstone. Mr. Craig has never
found the slightest trace of the coal-measures north of the trap which
forms its northern boundary,
   The following is a summary of the author's observations respect
ing the nature of the boulders at Bell's Park, and the extent to which
they have been scratched :—
    Greywacke, similar to that which is associated with slate near Rose
Neath, and mica-schist above Lass on the borders of Loch Lomond.
Blocks very abundant, generally smooth, angles rounded, scratches
longitudinal, seldom or never crossing each other.
    Porphyritic traps and basalts are next in abundance; a few of the
basalt-blocks are scratched, but none of the porphyritic.
    Granite.—The felspar large-grained; masses few in number, much
rounded, very smooth, not scratched.
    Old red sandstone and conglomerate.—Abundant, much rounded,
never scratched. The conglomerate blocks are very like a variety
near Glen Sannox in Arran.
    Quartzose rock.-Blocks not abundant, very smooth; more rounded
 than any other, not scratched.
    Coal sandstone.—Blocks angular, scratched longitudinally. Frag
 ments of iron-stone rare and angular, but smooth.
   * At this tunnel a bed of coal is stated to have been changed by trap into
a bed of pyrites; but a stratum of limestone, though only two feet from
the trap, is reported to retainits organic remains.

   Carboniferous limestone.—The masses belonging to this forma
tion are next in abundance to those derived from the traps. When
large they are much scratched longitudinally and transversely; and
the angles are sharp.
   “A note by Mr. Murchison on a Section and a List of Fossils from
the State of New York,” by James Hall, Esq., was likewise read.
   Mr. Murchison says, that in consequence of the researches of Mr.
Featherstonaugh, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Hall, Mr. Vanuxem, Mr. R. C.
Taylor, and other geologists, large tracts in the British colonies in
North America and in the United States have been for some time
known to be composed of formations containing Silurian, old red
sandstone and carboniferous fossils. Mr. Hall's section, presenting
a tabular view of the succession of formations, commences with the
red sandstone of Blossburgh in Pennsylvania, proved to be the repre
sentative of the old red sandstone or Devonian system of Great Bri

details under the heads           Physical      aspect,    Mineral structure, and
 Geological changes.
      1.Physical aspect.—The leading physical features are the mag
 nificent serrated mountains called Blue Berg                    Hottentot's Hol      or
land, which stretch northward for many miles into the interior;
 and the promontory which extends from Table Mountain                            the                             to

 by deep ravines; and Mr. Clarke states that their outline                 evidently                    is
 owing       deep vertical fissures intersecting horizontal strata, proving
              to

     Mineral structure and position.—In detailing the composition                                                        of
 the rocks and the associated phaenomena, Mr. Clarke describes sepa
 rately, and     the following order, first, each
                    in                               the principal physical      of
 masses; namely, the Lion's Rump, the district between Green Point
 and Camp's Bay, that between Camp's Bay and Cobler's Hole, the
 Kloof, and Table Mountain; and secondly, the modern deposits,
 springs and detritus.
    The Lion's Rump. —The lowest deposit           the Lion's Rump varies   at
                        glossy soft slate       hard and siliceous,    well
 as in
    characters from             a                                    to                                          as
      crystalline schist, and occasionally
      a                                           rock            to a

 bassanite. The partings                     of
                                   the masses are stated         frequently                       to   be
 lined with      substance resembling soapstone and serpentine; and
                    a

                               of                      somewhat columnar             a

           is easily        distinguished,
                                to   be      but the author         opinion                            is

 that it ranges between north and south.           The cleavage, where it
 can be detected, is nearly perpendicular to the horizon.              Overlying
 these schists and    composing   the upper  part  of the  hill,  is a yellowish,
 argillaceous and sandy laminated rock, which presents the same
jointed structure and cleavage as the schist; and owing to the                                              in
 tersection of the joints, the beds divide into wedge-shaped masses,
 or regular prisms with pyramidal terminations.              Mr. Clarke is of
 opinion that the subjacent schistose rocks have been intruded into
 or amongst these upper beds, and he states that the grooved and
fluted surfaces betray the intensity of the forces with which the
slaty masses were ground against each other. He mentions a quarry
below the Lion's Rump at the back of Cape Town, as an example
of the disturbed position of the schist and overlying sandy rock. He
suggests that the schists may belong to the Cambrian, and the super
jacent beds to the lower portion of the Silurian system.
    The schistose rocks occur also in Robben’s Island; and on the other
 side of the Lion's Rump they form a reef of hard rock along the
 shore, occurring at intervals at the bottom of Table Bay, and re-ap
pearing in the rounded low range upon the opposite coast. Grooves
and scratches, as well as ripple-marks, are very prominent on many
of the slabs.
    2. District from Green Point to Camp's Bay.—The rocks which
form the general base of the Lion's Hill are stated to be best exa
mined along the flat shore which skirts                    it,
                                                  and where the successive
formations crop out. The slate rocks gradually attain                 nearly ver        a
tical dip   asthey recede from the Lion's Rump; and between their out
crop  in  the sea, where they form the first line          barrier rocks, and
                                                                           of
 Green Point, they first change into mica-slate, which soon becomes
charged with hornblende, then presents mottled aspect, and gneiss
                                                           a                                                 is
ultimately exposed        contact with granite. At the immediate junc

      The author also alludes to the vegetable and other debris brought          to
      gether by the rains, and to the commencement by this means of an
      embryo lignite formation on one side of the Cape Flats.
          Springs.—The well-water in Cape Town is considered unwhole
      some.     Under Table Mountain is a spring which rises from the gra
      nite, and is computed to throw out daily 150,000 gallons; and at
      Newlands near Wynberg is a spring of sufficient volume to work two
      mills, and to discharge daily 850,000 gallons.            That these springs
      are not the result of accumulations       from the heights, is proved, Mr.
      Clarke   says, from their not    varying with the season, and because the
      water cannot be made to rise above the level at which it appears.
          Detritus.—The accumulations described under this head are en
      tirely local, being derived from the subjacent or neighbouring rocks.
      The smooth and rounded granite boulders also do not extend beyond
      the range of the granite, but Mr. Clarke is of opinion that the ancient
      currents which flowed over the Cape Flats may have assisted in their
      partial removal, and may have rounded some of them.                In the in
      terior, masses of granite, similar to the Tors of Dartmoor, are stated
      to occur.
          Geological changes.—The first points noticed by Mr. Clarke, are
      the protrusion of the granite through the slates at the Lion's Head, the
      consequent vertical position of the schistose beds, the occurrence of
      fragments of granite in blocks of sandstone; and the proofs deducible
      from the granite veins which penetrate and alter the gneiss, as well as
   ºº traverse the superincumbent sandstone, of the granite, since its first
      elevation, having been re-heated. He also alludes to the quartz veins
      which are crossed by others of the same nature, as evidences of there
      having been two periods of action during which the rock was fissured
      and veins formed; and to the trap dykes, as proofs of igneous acti.
      vity since the consolidation of the granite.          He likewise mentions
      the softening or the decomposition of the granite where traversed by
      trap dykes.
          The author next describes the changes in the relative level of land
      and sea.     Everything, he says, tends to confirm the inference, that
      the whole    country  was at a comparatively recent period under water.
      Thus the    shingle  beds,  resting upon granite, at Cobler's Hole, prove
      an elevation of at least 400 feet since the present species of testacea
      inhabited the adjacent seas; and he adds, “The water-worn masses
      of sandstone and the hollows in the beds of that rock in situ, iden
       tical with those now produced by sea-waves beating against a cliff,
  --   equally prove the condition of previous elevation; and the steep sides
  º
       of the granite, in parallel lines of coast, also lead to the conclusion that
  º   they were so modified by currents acting in lines coincident with their
*º
  *    direction.”    The occurrence of marine shells in the sand at the Cape
 *-   Flats likewise shows that the sea once covered that district; and the
  *
       grooves and scratches at the Lion's Rump, Mr. Clarke observes,
      justly lead to the inference of elevation. Before the commencement
       of these changes in the relative level of land and sea, False Bay and
       Table Bay must have been united by a sheet of water more than

536     Geological Society:—Mr.           Darwin on the Erratic
sixty fathoms deep, extending over the flats, and the Cape Promontory
must have been an island. To the action of the sea at that period. Mr.
Clarke attributes the production of the felspathic clay, and its accu
mulation at the Lion's Rump; and to the action of currents at an
earlier period, when the summit of the Table range lay as islands
and reefs not far above the level of the sea, the removal of the sand
stone and the excavation of the granite at the Kloof, also the denu
dation and rounding of the ridge of the Lion's Hill, the denudation
of Robben's Island, and the production of those terraces, which from
the summit of Table Mountain appear to stretch gradually down
wards to the Cape of Good Hope.         The separation of the Lion's
Rump and the Devil's          Mountain from the Table Mountain, and
the fissures throughout the range, the author conceives were pro
duced during the elevation of the country.          Proofs of changes of re
lative level of sea and land are stated to be equally apparent in the
interior; and Mr. Clarke says, that the inspection of an accurate map
will convince the inquirer, that Southern Africa must have been an
Archipelago.       In conclusion, some general observations are made on
the   great  similarity in the geological composition of Southern Africa
and New South Wales.
    May 5.-A Memoir “On the Distribution of the Erratic Boulders,
and on the contemporaneous unstratified Deposits of South America,”
by Charles Darwin, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., was read.
    The extensive regions more particularly noticed in this paper are
the plains traversed by the Rio Santa Cruz (lat. 50°S.); Tierra
del Fuego, including the coasts of the Strait of Magellan, and the
Island of Chiloe (lat. 43° S., long. 73° W.).

Mr. Darwin did not observe any boulders, and the only one he no
ticed in ascending the first 100 miles of the latter river was a mass
7 feet in circumference, about 57 miles from its mouth, or 100 from
the Cordillera.       At 100 miles from the coast, or 67 from the near
est  slope  of the   Cordillera,   transported blocks first occur, and 12
miles nearer the chain they are extraordinarily numerous, consisting
of clay-slate, felspathic rocks, chlorite schist and basaltic lava.
They are generally angular, and some of them are of immense size,
one being 60 feet in circumference, and projecting from 5 to 6 feet
above the surface of the ground.           The vast open plain on which
they  lie scattered,  is  here 1400 feet above the level       of
                                                                the sea, and
its  surface      somewhat irregular, owing partly
                 is                                       to denudation and
partly to   the protrusion  of  hummocks and fields   of   lava. The plain
slopes gently and regularly towards the Atlantic, where the sea
cliffs are about 800 feet high; but towards the Cordillera             itrises
more abruptly, attaining near the chain         an  elevation     of
                                                                   3000 feet.

ving that floating ice, charged with foreign matter, has been the chief
agent in its formation; but he adds that it is difficult to understand
how the finest sediment was arranged in horizontal laminae, and
coarse shingle in beds, while stratification is totally, and often sud
denly, wanting in the closely neighbouring till, if it be supposed
that the materials were merely dropped from melting drift ice; and
he is disposed to think that the absence of stratification, as well as
the curious contortions described in some of the stratified masses,
are mainly due to the disturbing action of icebergs when grounded.
He believes also that the total absence of organic remains in these
deposits may be accounted for by the ploughing up of the bottom
by stranded icebergs, and the impossibility of any animal existing on
a soft bed of mud or stones under such circumstances.       In confirm
ation of the   disturbing  action of  icebergs, Mr. Darwin refers to
Wrangell's remarks on their effects off the coast of Siberia.
   Chiloe.—North of latitude 47° and between it and the southern ex
tremity of Chiloe, the author landed at several points, but saw no
boulders; and he explains their absence by the coast being at a distance
from the Cordillera, and separated from it by intervening high land.
At Chiloe erratic boulders, often of great size and consisting of granite
and sienite, occur in vast numbers along the whole line of the east
ern and northern beaches, as well as on the islets parallel to the
eastern coast, and on the land at the height of upwards of 200 feet;
but the author did not observe any on the western coast at the two
points which he examined, nor during an excursion of 30 miles
across the high central portion of the island.    Chiloe consists, as far
as Mr. Darwin ascertained, of mica-slate and volcanic formations,
extensively bordered, but chiefly on the eastern and northern sides,
by a horizontally-bedded tertiary sandstone and volcanic grit. On
the eastern coast, the land is indistinctly modelled into successively
rising plains, the surfaces of the upper and the whole thickness of
some of the lower being in general composed of stratified shingle.
A few boulders occur in this gravel; and as the shores have been
extensively denudated, Mr. Darwin infers that most of the very
numerous blocks on the beaches were originally included in            At               it.

were much more numerous on the isthmus and its sides at the
height of 150 feet, than on any other part of the surrounding coun
try; and as the sea must have flowed over this isthmus in a channel,
previous to the amount of elevation, ascertained to have taken place
here within the post-pleiocene period, the position of these boulders
proves, according to Mr. Darwin, even more clearly than the cases
occurring in Tierra del Fuego, the evident relationship between
their distribution and the lines of anciently existing sea-channels.
In the southern half of Chiloe, and on one of the Chonos islands, the
author discovered a deposit of hardened mud, including far trans
ported, angular and rounded fragments, and resembling the till of
the Straits of Magellan.      In a layer of loose sand at the base of the
cliff in the latter locality, he noticed a quantity of comminuted ma
rine shells with a fresh aspect; and at Chiloe he also observed, at a
point where a mass of till passed into finely grained laminae, small
fragments of a Cytheraea.
    With respect to the age of the boulder formation of Chiloe, Mr.
Darwin offers no precise remark, but he says that it probably occurs
within the post-pleiocene period, because at a height of 350 feet on
 the peninsula of Lacuy, and therefore considerably above the level
 of this formation, a great bed of existing sea-shells was observed,
 and neither the boulder nor accompanying beds appear to have been
 of deep-water origin. Similar evidence was adduced respecting the
 age of the till of Tierra del Fuego.       North of 41°47' S. lat., Mr.
 Darwin did not observe on the Pacific side of South America either
 boulders or till; nor any north of the Straits of Magellan, on the
 shores of the Atlantic side; and he accounts for the absence of erra
 tic blocks in the latter region by its great distance from the Cor
 dillera.   He is also strongly of opinion that till will be found to
 be limited to the latitudes in which true boulders occur.
     Glaciers, &c.—In the concluding part of his memoir, the author
 offers a few remarks on the glaciers of Tierra del Fuego, and on the
 transport of the boulders.      He did not disembark on any glacier,
 but in the Beagle and Magdalen channels he passed within 2 miles
 of several. The mountains were covered with snow, and the gla
  ciers formed many short arms, terminating at the beach in low per
  pendicular cliffs of ice. Their surface, to a considerable height on
 the mountains, was perfectly clean and of a bright azure colour; and
 the former condition he ascribes to their shortness, to their not
 being flanked by overhanging precipices, and to their not being
 formed by the junction of two or more smaller streams. The de
  scent of the glaciers, Mr. Darwin states, cannot be very slow, as vast
  masses continually break off with a great noise, and produce a tu
 multuous surf on the adjacent beaches.        The glaciers in the Beagle
  Channel were generally bordered by a tongue of land composed of
 huge fragments of rock, and many boulders were strewed on the
 neighbouring shores.        The glacier which he approached most
 closely descended to the head of a creek formed on one side by a
 wall of mica-slate, and on the other by a broad promontory from
 50 to 60 feet high, on which he landed: it appeared to consist en

tirely of enormous    masses of granite.    This promontory, he con
ceives, was once a lateral moraine, and as it projects nearly half a
mile beyond the extremity of the glacier, and is covered with old
trees, he infers that the glacier has diminished in length to that ex
tent.
    Mr. Darwin says it is impossible to explain the distribution of
boulders without the agency of ice, but he adds, that neither the till
of the Strait of Magellan which passes into, and is irregularly inter
stratified with, a laminated sandstone containing marine remains,
nor the stratified gravel of Chiloe, can have been produced like
ordinary moraines.          The boulders, likewise, on the lower levels at
the head of the Santa Cruz river, he considers, could not have been
distributed in their present position by glaciers, the surface having
been modelled by the action of the sea; and the little inclination of
the high plain from the ridge of the Cordillera to where the boulders
occur, as well as the absence of mounds or ridges on              and the form                it,
 of  the fragments, render            very improbable that they were pro

                                         ancient glaciers.     Hence,      con                               he

542                    Geological Society:—Mr. Bowerbank
 calcareous rocks, and he is of opinion that the corrosion is due to the
  action of some acid secreted from the body of the limpet or helix.
    That the perforations, both at Boulogne and Tenby, were not the
 work of Pholades, Dr. Buckland says, is evident,
     1st. From their size and shape, which, instead of the straight and
 regular form accurately fitting the shell of the animal by which each
  hole was perforated, are tortuous, irregularly enlarging and contract
  ing, and rarely continuous in a straight line. The holes moreover
  are often separated by only a thin partition, or are confluent.
     2ndly. Because they are wanting on the upper surface of the
 projecting ledges of limestone, whilst on the sides and lower sur
 faces of the ledges they are excavated to considerable depths.
    The above reasons, Dr. Buckland says, against the excavations
 having been made by any marine lithophagous animal, are favour
 able to the hypothesis which refers the production of them to snails.
 These animals, he observes, could find shelter only on the margin
 and lower surface of the projecting rock, and the irregular form of
 the confluent cavities correspond with that of the clusters of snails
 in their ordinary latitat and hybernation; and if to these reasons be
 added the fact of finding both living and dead shells in the excava
 tions, the evidence, the author conceives, is decisive as to the agency
 of snails in producing the phaenomena under consideration.
    In conclusion, the author offers some remarks on the means by
 which these hollows have been corroded having been overlooked,
 in consequence, he suggests, of their having been probably referred
 to the action of the weather, or water, or to original irregularities in
 the composition of the stone.
    A paper “On Moss Agates and other Siliceous Bodies,” by John
 Scott Bowerbank, Esq., F.G.S., was then read.
    In a paper “On the Origin and Structure of Chalk-flints and
 Greensand Cherts”,” Mr. Bowerbank inferred that the sponges from
which he conceives those bodies originated, differed from recent kera
tose sponges only in having possessed numerous siliceous spicula.
 Since that paper was read, the author, however, has found in true
keratose sponges from Australiaf, as well as in the sponges of com
merce from the Mediterranean and the West Indiest, siliceous spicula
in great abundance. All discrepancies, therefore, between the extinct
and modern types of a portion of the animals under consideration, he
says, is now removed.      In these prefatory remarks, Mr. Bowerbank
likewise states that there is at present only one known species of
recent sponge (S. fistularis) the fibre of which is truly tubular.
    The author then proceeds to detail the evidences of the existence
in moss agates from Oberstein and other parts of Germany, as well
as from Sicily, and in green jaspers from India, of the remains of
sponges, in the following order: 1st, the proofs of the fibrous struc
ture; 2nd, of the preservation of gemmules; and 3rd, those of the

      1. Fibrous structure.—Though        polished agates afforded Mr. Bow
  erbank, in almost every specimen, strong evidence of spongeous origin,
  yet the structure and arrangement of the fibres were seldom per
  fectly preserved throughout, presenting every intermediate state from
  complete decomposition to the most distinct spongeous tissue. The
  siliceous matrix of these remains exhibited a clear and frequently
 crystalline aspect, but the prevailing tint of the enclosed organic
 matter was bright red, brown, or ochreous yellow; occasionally, how
 ever, the fibre was milk-white or bright green.          The colouring mat
 ter was generally confined within the bounds of the animal tissue,
 leaving its surface smooth and uninterrupted; sometimes it occurred
 only in the interior of the tubular fibre, the sides being semipellucid

544.             Geological Society:—Mr. Bowerbank
specimens the fibres were not disposed in the same manner as in the
sponge of commerce, but in a series of thin plates, resembling very
much the macerated woody fibres of the leaves of some endogenous
plants. Only one recent species, from Australia, is known to Mr.
Bowerbank to exhibit this structure.
    No spicula are mentioned by the author in either the agates or jas
pers, and but one instance of the occurrence of foraminifera. The whole
of the sponges contained in the green jaspers, Mr. Bowerbank refers
to that division of the keratose which he has called Fistularia.
     2. Gemmules.—A specimen of Indian green jasper, which had under
gone so great decomposition as to prevent the original fibrous structure
from being detected, presented innumerable globular vesicles of nearly
uniform size. Many of them were simple and transparent, and could
be recognised as organic only by the regularity of their size and form,
 and by having universally dispersed over their outer surface minute
irregular black particles; but by far the greater number of them
 had in their interior a globular opake body, about one-third their
 own diameter. Associated with these vesicles were numerous small
 fibrous masses resembling minute keratose sponges, the largest of
 which were five or six times the diameter of the vesicles; but the
 smallest were identical in nature with the nucleus, though in a higher
 state of development.      In other specimens from the same mass of
 jasper, larger vesicles were found more sparingly imbedded amidst
 the fibrous tissue of the sponge. From these characters and their
 resemblance to those of the ova of some recent sponges, Mr. Bower
 bank has little doubt that the vesicles are the fossilized gemmules of
  the sponges which gave the form to the siliceous masses in which they
  are imbedded. An agate supposed to have come from Oberstein,
 presented characters which, Mr. Bowerbank is of opinion, indicated
  gemmules in an immature state, or in different stages of development,
 fixed to the fibre of the sponge; and in another specimen, believed to
 have been received from the same locality, gemmules in different
 conditions were sparingly scattered amid the tissue.
     If this idea of the development of the gemmules in situ be correct,
 it will account, the author thinks, for the frequent occurrence of small
  detached patches of minute sponge-fibre in well-developed and large
  sized tissue. Several other specimens, considered by Mr. Bower
  bank to contain gemmules in different stages of development or de
  composition, are described in the paper, particularly an agate from
  Antigua in the possession of Mr. R. Brown; and one from Ober
  stein, which contained vast numbers of small, pellucid, yellow glo
 bules, bearing a strong resemblance to the minute granules which
  occur in the gelatinous or fleshy sheath surrounding the fibres of the
 sponge of commerce, and which are probably incipient germs. In
 accounting for the preservation of the gemmules in a fossil state,
  Mr. Bowerbank refers to the covering of the ova of birds, fishes and
  reptiles; and he says, it is natural to expect that the gemmules of
  the sponge should be similarly protected, and therefore preserved
  after the decay of the sponge from which they derived their origin.
     3. Vascular structure.—In a species of recent Turkey sponge, and

               on Moss Agates and other Siliceous Bodies.                                                    545
in some others from Australia", Mr. Bowerbank detected in the horny
sheath which invested the solid fibre, minute anastomosing vessels;
but he has not observed a similar vascular covering on the external sur
face of the two specimens of Spongia fistularis which he has examined.
The co-existence, however, of this sheath with a tubular fibre, he
states, he has discovered in specimens of Indian green jasper.                      On
examining with a power of 60 linear a thin polished slice, he
found that some well-preserved tubes, of greater size than the rest,
had, on their external surface, a coating of a darker colour than the
other parts of the fibre, and were evidently analogous to the vascular
 sheath of the keratose sponges of commerce. On employing a power
 of 500 linear, the presence of a reticulated vascular structure was
 exhibited as distinctly as in the recent sponge, particularly where a
 portion of the originally horny or fleshy part of the sheath had un
 dergone a slight degree of decomposition.                   This structure Mr.
 Bowerbank has also detected in two fragments of flint-pebbles.
      The characters exhibited by this external coating are not the
 only evidences of vascular structure which the author found during
 his examination of the organic remains inclosed in moss agates and
  Indian green jaspers, for he discovered in the centre of the tube
 which exhibited the sheath, a dark thread penetrating the cavity for
  a considerable distance, and when examined with a power of 500
  linear, it assumed the appearance of a spiral tubular thread, frequently
  obscured by irregular patches of a substance which the author con
  ceives may have been glutinous animal matter.                In another specimen
   of  green jasper   the spiral  course  of  this  curious   tissue   was much less
                                                                                                    of its
   obscure, and when examined with a power of 800 linear                        tubular
   nature was evident.       The   same  tissue   also  lined   the   cavity     almost
  every fibre        of
                   the  sponge   which was stated          exhibit      to
                                                                       structure   com  a
   posed  of  foliaceous   plates,  like the skeletons           the leaves  of    some                of
   endogenous plants.                          an

 fibres apparently much decomposed, as their substance consisted
 sometimes of a congeries of minute separate particles, and sometimes
of straight or curved lines composed of minute black bodies. In
other cases these strings of incipient gemmules were contained
within the boundaries of the tubes, and then presented rarely more
than a row of single gemmules; but occasionally the diameter of the
vessels appeared to have been much enlarged, and the gemmules
were indiscriminately dispersed within         cavity.                its

   January 8, 1841.-Remarks on the Present State of our Know
ledge relative to Shooting-Stars, and on the Determination of Dif.
ferences of Longitude from Observations of those Meteors.  By Mr.
Galloway.
  After adverting to      of the earlier opinions which have been
                               some
entertained on the nature of fire-balls, shooting-stars, and other ig
neous meteors, the author remarks that no very definite theory was
formed respecting them till towards the end of the last century;
for although the cosmical origin of the more remarkable bolides
and fire-balls had been suspected, the shooting-stars were generally
regarded as atmospherical phaenomena, which were ascribed by some
to electricity, and by others to the inflammation of hydrogen gas
accumulated in the higher regions of the atmosphere.                 In 1794,
Chladni published his celebrated     work,    in which he gave a catalogue
of   all
       the recorded observations       fire-balls; and, from comparison
                                             of                                   a
of the different descriptions, inferred that these meteors have not
their origin       our atmosphere, but are cosmical masses moving
                     in
through the planetary spaces with velocities equal               those      the  to             of
planets, which, when they encounter the earth's atmosphere, are                                      in

times bursting into pieces, and scattering masses             stone and ironof

ing the one class         of

however, there were              no

the Annuaire de Brurelles for 1837. M. Quetelet was chiefly solici
tous to determine the velocity of the meteors. He obtained six cor
responding observations from which this element could be deduced,
and the results varied from 10 to 25 English miles in a second. The
mean of the six results gave a velocity of nearly 17 miles per second,
a little less than that of the earth in its orbit.
    The last set of corresponding observations referred to in the paper
was made in Switzerland on the 10th of August, 1838; a circum
stantial account of which is given by M. Wartmann in Quetelet's
 Correspondance   Mathématique, for July 1839. M. Wartmann and
five other observers, provided with celestial charts, stationed them
 selves at the Observatory of Geneva; and the corresponding obser
vations were made by M. Reynier and an assistant at Planchettes, a
 village about 60 miles to the north-east of that city. In the space
 of seven and a half hours, the number of meteors observed by the
six observers at Geneva was 381; and during five and a half hours
the number observed at Planchettes by two observers was 104. All
the circumstances of the phaenomena—the place of the apparition
and disappearance of each meteor, the time it continued visible, its
brightness relatively to the fixed stars, whether accompanied with a
train, &c., were carefully noted. The trajectories were then pro
jected on a large planisphere.           The extent of the trajectories de
 scribed   by  the meteors was    very  different,  varying from 8° to 70° of
angular space, and the velocities appeared also to differ considerably;
but the average velocity concluded by M. Wartmann was 25° per
 second. It was found, from the comparison of the simultaneous ob
 servations, that the average height above the ground was about 550
 miles; and hence the relative velocity was computed to be about 240
 miles in a second. But as the greater number moved in a direction
 opposite to that of the earth in           its
                                             orbit, the relative velocity must
 be   diminished by the earth's velocity (about         19 miles       insecond).
                                                                            a

 largest are those which have the greatcstaltitudes, and only the smaller
 ones appear to come within 20 or even 40 miles of the earth.
    With respect to the casual observations of the phaenomena, the ac
 counts of which are very numerous, the most interesting conclusion
 which has been inferred from them is the periodical recurrence of
 shooting-stars in unusual numbers at certain epochs of the year. Of
 these epochs, the most remarkable is that of November, on account
 of the prodigious number of meteors which have been seen in some
 years at that time. The principal displays were in 1799, 1832, 1833,
 and 1834. On the 11th of November, 1799, thousands were ob
 served within a few hours by Humboldt and Bonpland at Cumana;
 and on the same night by different persons over the whole continent
 of America, from the borders of Brazil to Labrador, and also in
 Greenland and Germany.         On November 12th, 1832, they were
 seen over the whole of the north of Europe; and on November 12th,
 1833, the stupendous exhibition took place in North America which
 has been so often described.    From the accounts of this phaenome
 non collected by Prof. Olmsted, M. Arago computed that the num
 ber of meteors on this night amounted to 240,000.        In 1834, a si
 milar phaenomenon recurred on the night of November 13th, but on
 this occasion the meteors were of a smaller size. In 1835, 1836,
 and 1838, shooting-stars were observed on the night of November
 13th, in different parts of the world; but though diligently looked
for on the same night in the last few years, they do not appear to
have been more numerous than on other nights about the same
season,<-a circumstance which has shaken the faith of many in their
periodicity.
    The second great meteoric epoch is the 10th of August, first pointed
out by M. Quetelet; and although no displays similar to those of
the November period have been witnessed on this night, there are
more instances of the recurrence of the phaenomena.          In the last
three years shooting-stars have been observed in great numbers,
both on the 9th and 10th; but they appear in general to be unusually
abundant during the two first weeks of August. The other periods
which have been indicated are the 18th of October, the 23rd or 24th
of April, the 6th and 7th of December, from the 15th to the 20th of
June, and the 2nd of January; and it is not improbable that further
observations will add to the number.
    The different theories which have been given to explain the origin
and phaenomena of the shooting-stars are next stated. The following
are the principal:—
    1. That the shooting-stars and fire-balls are substances projected
from volcanoes in the moon.        It is known that a body projected
vertically from the moon with a velocity of about 8500 feet in a
second would not fall back upon the lunar surface, but would recede
from it indefinitely; and, in order to reach the earth, the projectile
would only require, under the most favourable circumstances, to
have a velocity of about 8300 feet. Such a velocity, which is only
about four or five times greater than that of a cannon-ball, is quite
conceivable; but the extraordinary exhibitions of 1799 and 1833, to

 say nothing of their supposed periodicity, is [are] utterly irrecon
 cilable with the theory of a lunar origin.              Benzenberg, however,
 adopts this theory, and supposes the shooting stars to be small
masses of stone, from one to five feet in diameter, which are pro
jected from lunar volcanoes, and circulate about the earth or about
the sun when their projectile velocity exceeds a certain limit.
     2. Dr. Olbers, and some other astronomers, have supposed the
 shooting-stars to be the débris, or fragments of a large planet, burst
 into pieces by some internal explosion, of which Ceres, Pallas, Juno,
 and Vesta, are the principal remaining portions.              The smaller frag
 ments continue to circulate about the sun in orbits of great eccen
 tricity, and when they approach the region of space through which
 the earth is moving, they enter the atmosphere with great velocity,
 and by reason of the resistance and friction are rendered incandes
 cent, and emit a vivid light so long as they remain within                                   it.

  place through which the earth passes              November. in    The principal
  difficulties attending this theory are the following:—First, that
  bodies moving        groups
                         in        the circumstances supposed must neces
                                       in
  sarily move       the same direction, and consequently, when they be
                    in
  come visible from the earth, would              appear all              to
                                                               emanate from one
  point and move towards the opposite. Now although the observa
  tions seem       show that the predominating direction
                    to                                                from north    is
  east    to south-west, yet shooting-stars are observed                 the same        on
  nights   to emanate from all points                of
                                              the heavens, and         move      all to             in
  possible directions.      Secondly, their average velocity (especially                                  as
  determined         by
                     Wartmann) greatly exceeds that which any body
  circulating about the sun can have                          at

solid matter approached so near the earth as many of the shooting

their great altitude and brilliancy are visible over considerable por
tions of the earth's surface, would afford excellent natural signals,
provided they could be identified with certainty, was an obvious
thought; but so long as they were regarded merely as casual phae
nomena, it could scarcely be hoped that they would be of much use,
in this respect, to practical astronomy. As soon, however, as their
periodicity became probable, the observation of the phaenomena ac
quired a new interest.        In observing the meteors for this purpose,
it is assumed that    they  appear  instantaneously to observers stationed
at a distance from each      other, and that the meteors seen by different
observers so    placed  are identically  the same.   These points are not
altogether free from uncertainty; but the results of the trials that
have been already made may be regarded as favourable, and as
showing that among the other methods of determining astronomical
positions, the observation of shooting-stars is not to be disregarded.
At the November meeting of this Society, in 1839, an account was
given of Professor Schumacher's observations at Altona on the
night of the 10th of August, 1838. On the same night, corre
sponding observations were made at several observatories in Ger
many; but those at Breslaw appear to have been the most success
ful. From twelve coincident observations at Altona and Breslaw,
Professor Boguslawski computed the difference of longitude of the
 two places to be 28" 22*07, which differs less than a second from
 that which had been previously adopted. In Silliman's American
 Journal for October 1840, an account is given of simultaneous ob
 servations made on the 25th of November, 1835, at Philadelphia,
 and at the College of New Jersey, at Princeton. . Seven coincidences
 were observed, and the mean result gave a longitude differing only
  1*2 from the mean of other determinations; the whole difference
 being two minutes. This appears to have been the first actual de
 termination of a difference of longitude by meteoric observations.
 In the corresponding observations of Wartmann and Reynier at
 Geneva and Planchettes, the differences of longitude deduced from
 three of the meteors, which were attended with peculiarities so re
 markable as to leave no doubt of their identity, were respectively
 2", 2"-3*, 2* 5", whence it would seem that a single observation
 may be in error to the amount of several seconds of time.           In the
 Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève for August 1840, there is given
 an account of the determination by this method of the difference of
 longitude between Rome and Naples.            The corresponding observa
  tions were begun in November 1838, and were continued at inter
 vals under the direction of Father Vico at Rome, and of Capocci and
  Nobili at Naples. The apparent paths of the meteors were traced
 on a celestial globe, and the times of appearance and extinction
 compared with clocks regulated by astronomical observations. The
 observed times of the extinction of the phaenomena presented a very
  satisfactory agreement, inasmuch as it is stated that there was in
  general a difference of only a few tenths of a second of time between
  the partial results for a difference of longitude amounting to 7" 5*7.

balls as signals for the determination of longitudes is claimed by
Dr. Olbers and the German astronomers for Benzenberg, who pub
lished a work on the subject in 1802. Mr. Baily, however, has
pointed out a paper published by Dr. Maskelyne twenty years pre
viously, in which that illustrious astronomer calls attention to the
subject, and distinctly points out this application of the phaenomena.
The paper, which is printed on a single sheet, is entitled “A Plan
for observing the Meteors called Fire-balls, by Nevil Maskelyne,
D.D., F.R.S., and Astronomer Royal,” and is dated Greenwich,
November 6th, 1783. After recounting some observations, from
which he infers that such meteors appear more frequently than is
commonly imagined, and stating the particulars to be attended to
in observing them, he adds:—
     “Itwould be well if those persons who happen to see a meteor
would put down the time by their watch when it first appeared, or

   Amongst the instruments alluded to in the statement of the pro
perty of the Society, “the Council have the satisfaction of bringing
before the notice of the members, the valuable joint present, from
 Sir John Herschel and his aunt Miss Caroline Herschel, of a seven
feet reflecting telescope made by the late Sir William Herschel, and
used by her in many of her observations.         This token of respect and
attention will be    duly estimated   by  the Society,    who will doubtless
preserve this interesting memorial of science with more than ordi
nary care.
   “Amongst the losses by death, during the past year, the Council
have to regret the decease of Capt. Drummond, Dr. Gregory, Prof.
Leybourn, and Mr. Best, on the home list; and MM. Olbers, Pois
son, and Littrow, on the foreign list.
   “Capt.Thomas Drummond was born at Edinburgh in October 1797,
and entered the corps of Royal Engineers in July 1815. In this de
partment his talent for mechanical combinations became conspicu
ous, which, together with his close attention to the study of che
mistry, rendered his services of considerable value. In 1819, he took
part in the trigonometrical survey which was then carrying on in
Great Britain, under the superintendence of Col. Colby; and whilst
in this employment, he suggested the happy idea of applying the
brilliant lamp, which goes under his name, to rendering visible the
distant stations.     An account of this valuable invention is printed
in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826*.
   “Capt. Drummond was an early member of this Society, and took
great interest in promoting         welfare.itsDuring the comparisons                                     of

Reform Bill. In this new employment Capt. Drummond exerted
himself with his usual zeal and ability, which led to a more intimate
connexion with the ministers then in power; and he was, in April
1832, appointed private secretary to Lord Althorp, then Chancellor
of the Exchequer.     In this situation he aided the cause of this So
ciety, and was the principal means of our obtaining the grant of the
present apartments which we now occupy.         In July 1835, he was
appointed under-secretary to the Earl of Mulgrave, Lord Lieute
nant of Ireland.   The arduous duties of his office, united with other
employments which he undertook, more especially as first commis
sioner of the Irish Railway Commission, in which his usual good
sense and indefatigable exertions were manifest, proved too much
for his physical strength. His constitution gradually gave way, and
it was soon apparent that the scene was about to close upon him
for ever. At length, in the plentitude of mental power and the
maturity of knowledge, beloved in private and esteemed in public
life,' he expired on the 15th of April last, and was followed to the
grave by thousands who revered his memory and mourned his loss.
    “Dr. Olinthus Gregory was one of the earliest members of the
Society, and for some time held the office of secretary. Though
educated in the old English school of mathematics, his acquaint
ance with the continental methods was much more extensive than
would have appeared from his writings, which were almost alto
 gether intended for those who had studied the older English writers.
 He knew generally what was going on abroad, particularly in the
 extensions of geometry made by the school of Monge.           As editor of
 the well-known Ladies' and Gentleman's Diaries, he was brought
into communication with young students who were desirous of dis
 tinguishing themselves in the exact sciences.        The protection and
 encouragement which he afforded to those who were pursuing the
path which he himself had trodden, will be gratefully remembered
 by many; and the period of his superintendence of those useful
works will be remembered as that in which every contributor of
 merit found a friend in the editor.    His manners were altogether in
 accordance with what might have been expected from the preceding
 account;    all   he
                  did and said was dictated                by

     “Simeon Denis Poisson (born June 21, 1781, died April 25, 1840)
was placed, by common consent, at the head of European analysts
on the death of Laplace.          He was of humble birth, and was admitted
in 1793 a student of the Ecole Polytechnique, then newly esta
blished.       It is stated, by the historian of this school, that, at the
age of eighteen, he submitted to his professor some ameliorations in
the method of demonstrating the binomial theorem; which that
teacher, who was no other than Lagrange, read publicly at his next
lecture, and which he declared his intention of adopting in future.
     “The life of Poisson was one of quiet and uninterrupted study.
He never held any situation connected with politics, nor was in any
way, during thirty years, prevented from pursuing his one great ob
ject, the application of the most abstruse and newest developments
of the integral calculus to problems of physics. The number of his
memoirs is enormous; to which must be added his elementary trea
tise on mechanics (which stands at the head of                            elementary                            all

to the imperfect presumptions derived from observation (imperfect on
account of the large liability to error of the older astronomers)
Lagrange had shown that the mean motions have no secular                                    in
equalities depending on the first power of the disturbing forces; or,
so far as this first power was concerned, on any powers of the ec
centricities or inclinations.   Laplace had shown that a certain se
cular  equation,  which should in theory be applied to the sidereal
day, would always be too small to be of any importance.           Poisson
extended the conclusions of Lagrange to the second power of the
disturbing forces, and, relatively, to any powers of the eccentricities
and inclinations; or rather, we may say, that he showed any se
cular equation of the mean motions to depend only on the fourth
power of disturbing forces; for, in the course of the investigation,
it appears that no such equation of any odd order can exist. As far
as the fourth powers of eccentricities and inclinations, he actually
shows the mutual destruction of an infinite number of non-periodic
disturbing terms; the rest of the powers are completed by a general
and different investigation.    In the problem of the rotation of the
earth, he generalises the investigation of Laplace, by taking into consi
deration the actual change of the axis on the earth; the former investi
gation considering only the change of the axis, supposed to be fixed
in the earth, relatively to the stars. The result agrees with that of
Laplace as to the non-existence of any sensible secular inequality.
    “Poisson belongs to a class of investigators of whom many are
always wanted, but one is permanently indispensable.
    “The applications of the newest powers of mathematical language
should always be made as near as may be to the time when they are
first exhibited. But such peculiar combination of address and power,
with a perfect knowledge of existing materials, is not of every-day
occurrence; nor is it permitted to say, uno avulso non deficit alter".

problem by Henderson, Struve, and Bessel, which I shall now pro
ceed more especially to consider.
   It would be wrong, however, not to notice that the first indica
tion of some degree of impression beginning to be made on the
problem seems to be found in Struve's discussion of the differences
of right ascension of circumpolar stars in 1819, 20, and 21. The
only positive result, indeed, of these observations       that      the case       is,            in
of  twenty-seven stars examined, none has parallax amounting              a                                            to

precession, and refraction, act equally on both stars, or so very
nearly so as to leave only an exceedingly small fraction of these cor
rections bearing on the results.             And when the stars are very un
equal in magnitude, there is a presumption that the difference of
their parallaxes is very nearly equal to the whole parallax of the
nearer one.
    The selection of a star for observation involves many considera
tions.    In that pitched on by M. Bessel (61 Cygni), the large star
so designated, is in fact a fine double star; nay, one that has been
ascertained to be physically double.             It is in every respect a highly
remarkable star. The mutual distance of                        individuals        great, its                      is
being about 16}". Now this being necessarily less than the axis                                                               is
their mutual orbit, affords            itself    presumption that the star
                                                 in                 a                                                         a of
near one. And this         presumption        increased        isthe unusually great        by
proper motion              of
                        this  binary   system,    which amounts              nearly                         to                 5"

 that inspection certainly does leave a very strong impression of a
 real and tolerably well-ascertained parallax having been detected in
 this star.   But at the same time an impression no less decided,
 owing to irregularities in the march of the curve, when compared
 with the true parallactic curve, is created,—that the errors of obser
 vation are far from being eliminated,—that, on the contrary, they
 bear such a proportion to the parallax itself as to leave room for
 some degree of hesitation, and to justify an appeal to a longer series
 of observations, and to concurrent evidence from other quarters,
 before declaring any positive opinion.      The evidence of this kind,
 in  short, is not equal to that afforded    by the similar projection of
 Bessel's observations of either of his two     comparison    stars. And
 to this it must be added, that only one star of comparison existing
in the line of a Lyrae, the possible effect of temperature and annual
instrumental variation is not eliminated from the result in the way
in which it is from the measures of 61 Cygni; while all that great
mutual support which the observations of parallaxes of the two com
parison stars afford each other in the latter case, is altogether wanting
in the former. These considerations, without any under-estimation
of the great importance and value of M. Struve's researches, yet
formed essential drawbacks on the immediate admission of his re
sults.
    In a word, I conceive the question of discovery as between these
illustrious, but most generous and amicable rivals, may be thus
fairly stated.   M. Struve's meridian observations in 1819–1821
seem to have made the first impression on the general problem, but
too slight to authorize more than a hope that it would yield at no
distant day. His micrometric measures of a Lyrae commenced more
than a year earlier, and have extended altogether over a longer pe
riod than M. Bessel's of 61Cygni.        From their commencement they
afford indications of parallax, and these indications accumulating
with time have amounted to a high degree of probability, and ren
dered the supposition of parallax more admissible than that of in
strumental or casual errors producing the same influence on the
measures.    On the other hand, M. Bessel's measures commencing
a year later, and continued on the whole through somewhat less

sisting of two individuals, the one of a high and somewhat brownish
orange, the other of a fine yellow colour, and each of which I con
sider fairly entitled to be classed in the first magnitude".          Their
distance is at present about 15" asunder, but it is rapidly diminish
ing, and in no great lapse of time they will probably occult one
another, their angular motion being comparatively small. Their
apparent distance was formerly much greater: how much we can
not say for want of observations, but probably the major axis of
their mutual orbit is little short of a minute of space. They, there
fore, afford strong indications of being very near our system.         Add
to which their proper motion is very considerable, and participated
in by both, which proves their connexion as a binary system; and
an additional presumption in favour of their proximity may be drawn
from their situation in what, from general aspect, I gather to be
the nearest region of the milky way, among an immensity of large
stars.
    Mr. Henderson observed these stars with great care both in right
ascension and declination with the very fine transit, and (in spite of
certain grievous defects in the axis) the otherwise really good and
finely divided mural circle of the Royal Observatory in that colony.
Since his return to England, he has reduced these observations with
a view to parallax, and the result is the apparent existence of that
element to what, after what has been said, we must now call the
great and conspicuous amount of a full second. Mr. Main, to whom
I am so largely indebted for allowing me to draw so freely on his
labours, has also discussed these results, and comes to the conclu
sion that (as might, perhaps, be expected) the right-ascension ob
servations afford a trace, but an equivocal one, of parallax, but
that in declination (I use his words) “The law of parallax is fol
lowed remarkably well.          There is scarcely an exception to the
proper change of sign, according to the change of sign of the co
efficients of parallax.     This is quite as much as can reasonably be
 expected in a series of individual results obtained from any meri
dional instrument for observing zenith distances. We cannot ex
 pect to find the periodical function regularly exhibited by the dif
 ferences. On the whole, therefore, we should say that, in addition

                             J.   F.
   From the earliest periods      history,          of
                                               has been found that   it                                      as
soon    as
        mankind turned their attention        astronomy,    became reto                  it
quisite    group the stars into different constellations, whose out
             to
lines might seem        designate various figures.
                              to                     Hence arose those
several constellations that have been handed down to us from the
Indians, Chinese, Egyptians, Persians, Arabians, Peruvians, and
others;       as
            well       those which the Greeks adopted, and which
                             as
have survived      our own times. However curious and interesting

 these constellations may seem, yet few of them will be found to
 express with any accuracy the figures which they are intended to
 represent.     It is probable that out of the strange mixture of men,
 animals, and other objects, which the first astronomers invented,
 the imaginative Greeks made the present combination or selection.
 That the Greeks derived these constellations from an Asiatic people,
 and that they did not (as Newton supposed) invent them shortly
 after the Argonautic expedition, is evident from their not being
 able, for some time at least, to explain the constellations according
 to their mythology.      I need only mention the Greek constellation
 Ev yorary, or kneeling figure, which we now call Hercules, and the
 Oppus, or bird, which we now designate as the Swan; neither of
 which are explained in their mythology.         Combined with this my
 thology the constellations were sung by the Greek and Roman poets,
 and are now become classical.           In the present advanced state of
 astronomy, however, we do not arrange the stars wholly according to
 the constellations, but according to their right ascensions; yet these
 constellations are a valuable assistance towards an artificial memory,
 and afford us an excellent method whereby we are enabled to know
 and distinguish the various stars in the heavens, and to remember
 and record their places. The ancient Greeks reckoned only forty
 six constellations, or, at most, forty-seven, if we include the XmYat,
 or claws, of the Scorpion as a separate constellation, which had been
denoted as Libra before the existence of the Alexandrian school;
to which Hipparchus added the forty-eighth, namely, Equuleus.
The flattery of some courtiers was exerted to create two other con
stellations, viz. the Hair of Berenice and Antinous, but without
success; till Tycho at last gave them a permanent place in the
heavens.
    In the fifteenth century, when navigation was extended beyond
 the equator, and sailors noted those stars in the southern hemi
 sphere which were not visible to the ancients, they also found it
convenient and useful to adopt the same plan of grouping the new
 stars into constellations.     They did not, however, adapt them to
the Greek    mythology,    but selected principally such objects as pre
sented themselves in the newly-discovered countries:          whence we
have, for the southern constellations, the Phoenix, the Toucan, the
Little Water-snake, the Sword-fish, the Flying-fish, the Fly, the
Chameleon, the Bird of Paradise, the Peacock, the Indian, and the
Crane.     The ancients took only those parts of the heavens, as the
ground-work of the constellations, where the bright stars existed:
consequently, there were many places where there were no con
stellations, and the stars which were scattered over such situations
were called apoppwrot,      or informes.    There was no inconvenience
in this: but     some of these empty spaces were very great, and ex
hibited here and there stars that seemed to be as much entitled to
be formed into a constellation as several of the existing ones.
Therefore modern astronomers, as Bartschius relates, (and, perhaps,
he himself, partly) invented and formed the new constellations
called the Camelopard, the Unicorn, the Fly, and the rivers Jordan,

even to retain some of those which have been introduced in the

endanger the wished-for uniformity in our maps; therefore, it might
appear quite unnecessary for me to fix a precise point where the

   Venus was near her inferior conjunction              the autumn       in the                          of
year 1839, and the observed errors were consequently very well suited
for the correction of the elements. The results deduced now de
pend       oneighty-two equations, which, the author remarks, are

which he adopts of luting together the crown and flint-glasses form
ing the achromatic combinations, by means of balsam of Canada
almost cold, this process being not subject to the inconvenience at
tached to the use of mastic in drops recommended by other artists.
He also suppresses the use of diaphragms in the tubes of his tele
scopes, which he lines with black velvet.
    The author's micrometrical lunette consists of a telescope bent at
right angles, in the manner of a Newtonian reflector, carrying a
sight on the object-end and a small perforated mirror on the eye
piece, which combination permits the observer to see at once, and
with the same eye, an object at a fixed distance, and the image of the
object produced by the telescope.           All the usual micrometrical and
illuminating methods are applicable to the sight, on which may be
traced divisions as small as we choose, being read by a small tele
scope parallel to the first, and placed before the metallic mirror.

  June 11.—The following communications were read:—
   A New Catalogue of Moon-culminating Stars, observed at South
Kilworth.    By the Rev. Dr. Pearson.
   This catalogue contains 520 stars which fall within the passage
of the moon, in every situation of the nodes, and which had been
published in the Appendix to the first volume of the author's work
on Practical Astronomy”.     The stars in this catalogue had been
selected by Caturegli from the determinations of different observers,
and therefore might be supposed to have their places assigned with
different degrees of accuracy, so as to require a new series of care
ful observations, and reduction with improved constants, to ren
der them suitable objects for so delicate a purpose as the deter
mination of longitudes, by comparison with the moon's limb, upon
or near the meridian. This consideration induced Dr. Pearson to
confine his stellar observations to moon-culminating stars, employing
for the purpose, contemporaneously, the transit instrument and
circle, described in his work before referred to, and a clock by
Hardy, which is an exact fellow to the transit-clock at Greenwich
in its original state. The observations were continued uninter
ruptedly from November 4, 1830, to May 7, 1834; when, on ac
count of inconvenience arising from the smoke of the village, the
instruments were removed to another building in the author's pri
vate grounds, lying in the same meridian and 4" to the south of the
former.   They were here continued till the end of the year 1837,
when it was found that, with very few exceptions, the whole of the
stars had been observed at least six times.
   The reductions were made with the constants given in the Astro
nomical Society's Catalogue for the epoch 1830, for the purpose of
direct comparison with that catalogue, using the annual precessions
given in that work. Brinkley's refractions were used in the reduc
tion of the circle observations, which include stars as low as 8° of
altitude, and may therefore possibly furnish data for correction of
the tables of refractions; with which view the original observations
have been preserved. The telescopes used are by Tulley, and the
object-glasses, of 34 inches aperture and nearly 44 inches focal
length, may be considered excellent in their definition of a large star.
The collimation in altitude was determined by a small collimating
telescope, by reversion of the azimuthal positions; and comparison
of the sum of reversed readings with 90° proved highly satisfactory
in every instance.
   The resulting right ascensions of the stars used for clock-error
are given in an appendix, that their close agreement with the right
ascensions derived from a multiplicity of observations at Greenwich
may be exhibited.
   Numerical corrections were not applied for the instrumental
errors, but the instruments themselves were kept in adjustment by

means    of hanging levels. The meridian mark on the northern wall
of a    house,  directly to the south of the transit instrument, was
never observed to deviate in position; though the pillar, carrying
the northern mark, was liable to deviations when the sun was power
ful or the frost severe.
    On the Advantages to be attained by a Revision and Rearrange

 Southern Hemisphere, and on the Principles upon which such Re
arrangement ought to be constructed.         By Sir       J.

Bart., K.H., V.P.R.A.S., &c. &c.
    The stars must have been divided into groups, which, as also
 single stars, would have received names long before they began to
be considered with reference to the seasons, or the sun's motion in
 the ecliptic.   The best-defined groups would be the first named, but
 in the stars of the zodiac this principle would be afterwards modified,
 for the convenience of dividing the circle into equal parts.      In the
extra-zodiacal regions no principle seems to have prevailed, either
of subdivision or nomenclature; and many of the figures of the con
 stellations scarcely resemble the forms intended, with the excep
tion of a few, as Scorpio for example. Names, however, would be
imposed from other associations than mere form.         The author pro
poses to consider how far the present system of constellations is
adapted to the purposes of astronomy, and to examine by what mo
difications it may be made more serviceable; and also to inquire into
the circumstances which render a systematic revision of them de
sirable, or even necessary, at the present advanced epoch.
    The use of constellations to the astronomer is to enable him to
refer to a particular star.    For this purpose, a distribution on any
principle would serve; yet even on this point the present system
often leads to confusion : for, 1st, the similarity of the names of se
veral constellations, and the bestowing on a new constellation the
name of an old one, with an adjunct for the sake of distinction,
render it necessary in many cases, in order to avoid confusion, to
write the names at full length: thus, for example, we have (with
 several others) Ursa major and minor, three Triangles, Pisces and
Piscis, Apis and Apus, Telescopium repeated three times, Quadrant,
 Sextant, and Octant, &c. &c.      2ndly, Some constellations are so ex
tensive that   they exhaust three or more alphabets, and therefore it
is sometimes    necessary, beside the letter of the star, to specify also
its  right ascension and declination: for example,      Argo three stars

    To the astronomer who refers to stars by their catalogued places,
these inconveniences may not afford serious ground of complaint;
since even in the southern hemisphere but few stars of the fifth mag
nitude remain uncatalogued.       Nor are the defects of the present
system felt by seamen, who have little to do with the constellations
beyond referring to a few well-known stars. But to those who em
ploy themselves in the physical departments of practical astronomy,
such as variable stars, photometrical determinations, and other sub
jects, and who require a perfect familiarity with the aspect of the
heavens, the present arbitrary and capricious allotment of the stars
renders reference to maps constantly necessary. And when the
leading stars in the map are not those which in the heavens catch
the eye by their brightness, it becomes necessary alternately to                in
spect the map by candlelight, and then to rush out into the dark
ness, to compare the impression made on the memory with the vi.
sible aspect of the stars, to the loss of all delicacy of vision, and the
injury of the organ itself.
    The author had proposed to himself to follow out, in the southern
 hemisphere, the plan adopted by the late Sir William Herschel, in
 order to place on record the relative apparent magnitudes of the
 stars at this epoch; and it was while thus engaged that he became
impressed with the necessity of a total reformation of the ancient
 y; enumerating
SVStem.
                      the qualities which a system of sidereal arrange
ment should possess, the writer observes that the new subdivisions
should be of moderate extent, the figures easily traced, and the
groups such as naturally arrange themselves in distinct forms.
Again, the boundaries ought to be definite, so as to be transferred
from one map to another without variation; they should accordingly
be arcs of great circles, or parallels to a great circle; that           is,
                                                                      circles
of   right ascension and parallels         of
                                           declination.    The limits, thus
assumed, should correspond          toaparticular epoch, being reduced              to
 any other time,   by  the necessary tables, like stars. The advantages
                         be
                                                               be
of  this system would        that each star would           once referred

its proper district; that the observer, becoming familiar with the
limits, would know the time when each star approached his meri
dian,      also the limits
          as               of altitude between which         would be com

p rised.
    After some remarks      on the mode        carrying the proposed plan
                                                of
into execution, the writer suggests:—
     1. That the names of constellations should be such as not             be  to
 easily confounded either when spoken            or
                                                printed.
     2. Each name should       be Latin, with     regular genitive case;
                                                     a                              to
 which the astronomers    of  different nations should conform, without
 translating them into their own languages.
     3.   Inthe names, low       orhomely associations, technicalities              of
 science, and national and political allusions, should              be
                                                              avoided.
     4. General names should          be

        5. The naming of constellations after their imagined figures must
 be abandoned.
     Individual stars are most conveniently designated by Greek let
 ters, the letters of the alphabet being assigned in the order of the
 brightness of the stars.    The inconvenience which would sometimes
 attend this last condition might be remedied.
     The practice of giving a proper name to each star is so conve

 the third magnitude, at least; and he concludes with some further
 suggestions on this point.    The paper is accompanied by a plate in

  about daylight, when it will be at rest, and the barometer will again
  be at a mean.
     “This theory was given by me to the Journal of the Franklin
  Institute, and published ten or twelve years ago.
     “I   ventured in that paper to predict, notwithstanding some         al
  leged observations at St. Bernard's Hospital to the contrary, that it
  would be found by more careful observations that the morning maxi
  mum fluctuation would be greater in lofty situations, on the sides of
 mountains, provided they were not very lofty, than on the plain below.
     “For it is manifest, that there will be not only a reaction at these
 lofty situations, (a little less, it is true, than below,) but some of the
 air will be lifted up, by the expansion of the air below, above the
 upper place of observation; which would in all probability more
 than compensate the diminished reaction at moderate elevations.
     “This prediction has been entirely verified by Lieutenant-Colonel
 Sykes's observations in India, and this verification may be consi
 dered as a strong proof of the correctness of the theory.       It is quite
 probable, that maximum day fluctuation occurs later at considerable
 elevations than on the plain below.
     “The theory would lead us also to suppose, that at very great
 elevations, where the reaction is very minute, only two fluctuations
 would be found in the day: the maximum at about two o'clock P.M.,
 when most air would be above the barometer; and the minimum at
daylight in the morning, when least air would be above it; but I
know of no observations to confirm or refute these deductions.”
    Mr. Ball brought under the notice of the Academy the fact, that
the ordinary Sturgeon of the Dublin markets is an undescribed species.
He stated that Mr. Thompson of Belfast, and Professor Agassiz, con
curred with him in this opinion, and he proposed to call it Accipen
ser Thompsoni, purposing, if permitted, to give figures and full de
scriptions in a future number of the ‘Proceedings.”

    December 14.—Dr. Apjohn read the following notice, by George
J.  Knox, Esq., of “some Improvements in the Voltaic Pile.”
    “The chief imperfection in the voltaic pile—its want of a constant
uniform power of long duration, by which it is rendered almost use
less as an instrument of research—having been overcome by the
ability of Professor Daniell, the only thing that remained to render it
efficient seemed to be, to increase its power; a desideratum accom
plished by Mr. Grove, by substituting for copper and sulphate of
copper, platinum and nitric acid.
    “The following experiments were undertaken with the intention
of estimating the relative values of the different constructions of
Grove's battery, recommended by Mr. Knight of Foster Lane, as far
as respects the arrangement of the zinc and platina plates, when, to
my surprise, I found the same quantity of electricity to be evolved
when the zinc is bent so as to expose an opposing surface to each
surface of a platinum plate, as when a platinum plate, of the size of
the former zinc, is similarly placed with respect to a plate of zinc of

conductor to the first jar. If the last one was removed, and its chain
fastened to the next, the first jar would take a few more sparks, and
so on; for it was found, that whenever the last jar in the series at any

when the last but one was removed, clearly proving that the capa
city or aptitude of the first jar to take a charge was influenced and
diminished by the second, more so by the third, fourth, &c. Its apti
tude was greatest when it was by itself, and not connected, as de
scribed, with the others.
    “This result disappointed my expectations, so far as my intended
improvement on the electric battery was concerned; and it also ap
peared to point out the existence of a principle influencing the charge
of the electric jar, which was not recognized in the popular treatises
on electricity.   I procured a number of glass plates with fixed and
moveable coatings.      These plates were insulated and arranged with
and without coatings in every way that Brande's rule required, but
the general result was the same as that given above.
    “From numerous experiments made with these plates, I came to
the following general conclusions:—
    “1. That the actual quantity of the positive and negative electri
cities which we can accumulate in the opposite surfaces of an electric
or non-conductor, as a plate of glass or dry ice, depends upon the
distance  of these surfaces.
    “2. Every case of charge of one jar or plate may be assimilated
to that of any number of jars or plates in a series such as Brande's,
by supposing the one jar or plate to be divided into the greater num
ber, its thickness being the sum of the thicknesses of all the segments
or plates; the inside of the first jar or surface of first plate in con
tact with conductor, and outside of last jar or plate in contact with
the ground, being considered as the proper opposite surfaces of the
 proper plate, and those on which the electricities evolved by the
friction of the cylinder and rubber of the electrifying machine are ac
 cumulated or heaped.
    “If  we make a pile of the plates, coated or not, and charge the
 outside surfaces by coating them, and connecting one with the cylin
 der and the other with the rubber of the machine, we find all the con
 ditions of the experiment complied with. There is no necessity for
 any connexion with the ground, which in Brande's can act merely as
 the conductor to convey the negative charge of the rubber to the ex
 treme surface.
    “Let us now unpack the pile, and we find that the charge of the
 intermediate plates diminishes as we approximate towards the centre
 of the pile, being greatest near the extremes.   At equal distances the
 charges are equal; for the charges of the first plate but one, and the
 last but one, will as perfectly neutralize each other as the charges of
 the surfaces of the first and last. The same is found to be the case
 with the surfaces of the third plates from each extreme, and so on of
 the others; but it is not the case with a second and a third, a first
  and a fourth plate, and so on, no two unequals as to place exactly

     M. F. Woehler obtains this acid by decomposing the mellitate of
lead or of silver; the first by hydrosulphuric and the last by hy
drochloric acid, any excess of the latter being separated by evapo
ration. Mellitic acid is very soluble, and crystallizes from a concen
trated solution in small reticulated crystalline needles of a silky
lustre. This acid suffers no change by exposure to the air; it has
a strongly acid taste, fuses when heated, and burns in the air with
a brilliant sooty flame, with an aromatic smell, and yielding a great
quantity of carbon, without leaving any residue. When heated in a
retort a portion is volatilized without decomposition, but the larger
proportion is completely decomposed. Crystallized         mellitic acid
does not yield water till heated to nearly 400°Fahr.
   It is composed of nearly—

  SALTs OF LEAD CONTAINING ACIDS OF OXYGEN AND AZOTE.
     M. Peligothas re-examined the salts         lead which contain the  of
acids formed by oxygen and azote.        He observes that Proust, about
thirty years since, first obtained the yellow salt     lead by dissolving            of
metallic lead      in
                  solution             of
                              the nitrate.    He was     opinion that the             of

 opinion that these salts, of which he finds there are three, contain
 nitrous acid, formed, according to the experiments of Dulong, of
 two volumes of azote and 4 volumes of oxygen, and is prepared by
the decomposition of nitrate of lead.
    The salt discovered by Proust is prepared by dissolving an equiva
