                     I.    On the      Origin of Nebulue.
                By   JAMES CROLL,            LL.D., F.R.S.*
          object of the present communication is to examine
THEthe      bearings of the modem science of energy on the
question of the origin of nebulae, and in particular to con
sider the physical cause of the dispersion of matter into stellar
space in the nebulous form.       In doing so have studiously  I
avoided the introduction of mere hypotheses and principles not
generally admitted by physicists.      These remarks may be
necessary, as the title of the paper might otherwise lead to the
belief that it is on a speculative subject lying outside the
province of the physicist.
    The question of the origin of nebulae is simplified by the
theory, now generally received, that stars are suns like our
own, and that nebulae are in all probability stars in process
of formation. The problem will therefore be most readily
attacked by considering, first, the origin of our sun, as this
orb, being the one most accessible to us, is that with which we
are best acquainted.
                                       I
   By the origin of the sun do not, of course, mean the origin
of the matter constituting the sun —this being an inquiry with
which the physicist has nothing whatever to do — but simply
its origin as a sun, t. e. as a source of light and heat.   Our
first question must therefore be, What is      the origin of the
sun's heat ? From what source did he derive that enormous
amount of energy which in the form of heat he has been dis-

sipating into space during past ages?         Difficult as the ques
tion at first sight appears to oe, it is yet simplified and brought
within very narrow limits when we remember that there are
only two conceivable sources.       The sun must have derived his
energy    either from  Gravitation, or from that other source to
which   I  directed attention several years ago*, Motion in Space.
All other sources of energy put together could not have sup
plied our luminary with one thousandth part of that which he has
possessed.     We are therefore compelled to attribute the sun's
heat to one or other of these two, or to give up the whole in
quiry as utterly hopeless.      The important difference between
the two is that the store of energy derivable from Gravitation
could not possibly have exceeded 20 to 30 million years' sup
ply of heat at the present rate of radiation ; whereas the store
derivable from Motion in Space, depending on the rate of that
motion, may conceivably have amounted to any assignable
quantity.     Thus a mass equal to that of the sun, moving with
a velocity of 476 miles per second, possesses in virtue of that
motion energy sufficient, if converted into heat, to cover the
present rate of the sun's radiation for 50 million years. Twice
that velocity would give 200 million years' heat ; four times
that velocity would give 800 million years' heat, and so on
without limit.
    It however, not enough that we should have in the form
      is,
of motion in space energy sufficient. We must have a means
of converting this motion into heat — of converting motion of
translation into molecular motion.         To understand how this
can be effected, we simply require the conception of Collision.
Two bodies moving towards each other will have their motion
of translation converted into molecular motion (heat) by their
encounter.
    To which of these two causes must we attribute the Sun's
heat?     It certain that gravitation must have been cause
            is                                            a       ;
 andif   we adopt the nebular hypothesis of the origin of our
 solar system, then from 20 to 30 million years' heat may thus
be accounted for.      But we know from geological evidence that
 the sun has been dissipating his light and heat at about the
 present rate for a much longer period.        In paper published
                                                  a

 considerable length, and have pointed out that the time which
 has elapsed since life began on the globe cannot have been less
 than 60 million years. This estimate        is based upon a   rough
 estimate of the thickness of rock which has been removed by
 subaerial denudation since the earliest epoch of which geolo-

we are able to determine roughly the time required for the
removal of the rock.       But the 60 million years thus obtained,
be it observed, are only the inferior limit.        We know that a
certain amount of rock nas been removed ; but how much more
may have been carried away we cannot tell. Consequently,
although we have good grounds for believing that 60 million
years have elapsed since life began on the globe, yet the lapse
of time may really have been very much longer. We are jus
tified, therefore, in concluding that our globe has been receiv
ing from the sun for the past 60 million years an amount of
light and heat daily not very sensibly less than at present.
This shows that gravitation alone will not explain the origin
of the sun's heat, and that a far more effective cause must be
found. Now the only other conceivable cause exceeding that
of gravity       of course, motion in space.
                is,
    If the gravitation theory fails to explain the origin of the
sun,     fails yet more decidedly to account for the neoulae. In
fact
    it itdoes not attempt any explanation of the origin of the

                it

 this tendency could exist without producing its effect.         The
advocates of the theory are not at liberty to call in the aid of
heat   in  order to explain why the particles are not mutally
approaching      ;because         this mutual approach which, ac
                                  it     is
 cording to the theory, produces the heat, and of course with
 out such approach no heat could be generated. A nebulous
 mass with      atendency to condensation could not have existed
 from eternity as such       but what the previous condition of

 whether they were eternal or were created, are questions wholly
 beyond the domain of the physicist.         The theory takes for a
 fact the existence of stellar masses in a state of motion ; and its
 advocate is not required, as a physicist, to account for the ex
 istence either of those masses or of their motions.     Neither is
 it necessary for him to advance any hypothesis to show how
 the masses came into collision ; for unless we are to assume
 that all stellar masses are moving in one direction and with
 uniform velocity (a supposition contrary to known facts), then
 collisions must occasionally take place.      The chances are that
 stellar masses are of all sizes, moving at random in all direc
 tions and with all velocities. We have here therefore, without
 any hypothesis, all the conditions necessary for the origin of
 nebulae.   Take the case of the origin of the nebulous mass out
 of which our sun is believed to have been formed. Suppose
 two bodies, each one half the mass of the sun, approaching each
 other directly at the rate of 476 miles per second (and there
 is nothing at all improbable in such a supposition), their colli
 sion would transform the whole of the motion into heat afford
 ing an amount sufficient to supply the present rate of radiation
 for 50 million years.      Each pound of the mass would, by the
 stoppage   of the  motion,  possess not less than 100,000,000,000
 foot-pounds of energy transformed into heat, or as much heat
 as would suffice to melt 90 tons of iron or raise 264,000 tons
 1° C.    The whole mass would be converted into an incandes
 cent gas, with a temperature of which we can form no adequate
 conception.     If we assume the specific heat of the gaseous
 mass to be equal to that of air (viz. -2374), the mass would
 have a temperature of about 300,000,000° C., or more than
 140,000 times that of the voltaic arc.
    Reason why Nebulce occupy so much Space. — It may be ob
jected that enormous as would be such a temperature, it would
 nevertheless be insufficient to expand the mass against gravity
 so as to occupy the entire space included within the orbit of
 Neptune.      To this objection it might be replied, that if the
 temperature in question were not sufficient to produce the
 required expansion, it might readily have been so if the two
 bodies before encounter be assumed to possess a higher ve
 locity, which of course might have been the case.             But
 without making any such assumption, the necessary expan
 sion of the mass can be accounted for on very simple prin
ciples. It follows in fact from the theory, that the expansion
 of the gaseous mass must have been far greater than could
 have resulted simply from the temperature produced by the
 concussion.     This will be obvious by considering what must
take place immediately after the encounter of the two bodies,

                  Dr.  J. Croll  on the Origin of Nebulce.             5
and before the mass has had sufficient time to pass completely
 into the gaseous condition. The two bodies coming into col
 lision with such enormous velocities would not rebound like
 two elastic balls, neither would they instantly be converted
 into vapour by the encounter. The first effect of the blow
 would be to shiver them into fragments, small indeed as com
 pared with the size of the bodies themselves, but still into
 what might be called in ordinary language immense blocks.
 Before the motion of the two bodies could be stopped, they
 would undoubtedly interpenetrate each other; and this of course
 would break them up into fragments.             But this would only be
 the work of a few minutes.            Here, then, we should have all
 the energy of the lost motion existing in these blocks as heat
 (molecular motion), while they were still in the solid state; for
as yet they would not have had sufficient time to assume the
 gaseous condition.         It is obvious, however, that the greater
 part of the heat would exist on the surface of the blocks (the
 place receiving the greatest concussion), and would continue
 there while the blocks retained their solid condition.            It is
 difficult in imagination to realize what the temperature of the
surfaces would be at this moment. For, supposing the heat
were uniformly distributed through the entire mass, each
pound, as we have already seen, would possess 100,000,000,000
foot-pounds of heat. But as the greater part of the heat would
at this instant be concentrated on the outer layers of the blocks,
these layers would be at once transformed into the gaseous
condition, thus enveloping the blocks and filling the inter
spaces.       The temperature of the incandescent gas, owing to
this enormous concentration of heat, would be excessive, and
its expansive force inconceivably great. As a consequence the
blocks would be separated from each other, and driven in all
directions with a velocity far more than sufficient to carry
them to an infinite distance against the force of gravity were
no opposing obstacle in their way.          The blocks by their mutual
impact      would  be  shivered  into smaller fragments, each of which
would consequently become enveloped in incandescent gas.
These smaller fragments would in a similar manner break up
into still smaller pieces, and so on until the whole came to
us -i 1i nc the gaseous state.     The general effect of the explosion,
however,      would   be to  disperse the blocks in all directions, ra
diating from the centre of the mass.          Those towards the outer
circumference of the mass, meeting with little or no obstruc
tion to their onward progress, would pass outwards into space
to indefinite distances, leaving in this manner a free path for
the layers of blocks behind them to follow in their track.
Thus eventually a space, perhaps twice or even thrice that in

6               Dr. J.  Croll on  the  Origin of Nebula.
eluded    within the orbit of Neptune, might be filled with frag
ments by the time the whole had assumed the gaseous con
dition.
     It would be the suddenness and almost instantaneity with
which the mass would receive the entire store of energy, before
it had time even to assume the molten, far less the gaseous
condition, which would lead to such fearful explosions and
dispersion of the materials.         If the heat had been gradually
applied,   no  explosions,  and  consequently no dispersion, of the
materials would have taken place.            There would first have
been a gradual melting ; and then the mass would pass by slow
degrees into vapour, after which the vapour would rise in
 temperature as the heat continued until it became possessed of
 the entire amount. But the space thus occupied by the gaseous
 mass would necessarily be very much smaller than in the case
 we have been considering, where the shattered materials were
 first dispersed into space before the gaseous condition wa»
assumed.
      Reason tchy Nelulie are of swch various Shapes.— The latter
 theory accounts also for the various and irregular shapes as
 sumed by the nebulae ; for although the dispersion of the
 materials would be in all directions, it would, according to
 the law of chances, very rarely take place uniformly in all di
  rections.    There would generally be a greater amount of dis
 persion    in certain directions, and the materials would thus
 be carried along various lines and to diverse distances ; and
  although gravity would tend to bring the widely scattered
  materials ultimately together into one or more spherical masses,
  yet, owing to the exceedingly rarefied condition of the gaseous
  mass, the nebulae would change form but slowly.
      Reason why Nebula; emit such Feeble Light. — The feeble light
  emitted by nebul® follows as a necessary result from the theory.
  The light of nebula is mainly derived from glowing hydrogen
  and nitrogen in a gaseous condition ; and it is well known that
  these gases are exceedingly bad radiators.        The oxyhydrogen
   flame, though its temperature is only surpassed by that of the
   voltaic arc, gives nevertheless a light so feeble as scarcely to
   be visible in the daytime. Now, even supposing the enormous
   space occupied by a nebnla were due to excessive temperature,
   the light emitted would yet not be intense were it derived from
   nitrogen or hydrogen gas.          The small luminosity of nebulae,
   however, is   due  to a different cause.    The enormous space oc
    cupied by those nebulae is not so much owing to the heat which
    they possess, as to the fact that their materials were dispersed
   into space before they had time to pass into the gaseous con
   dition; so that, by the time this latter state was assumed, the

             Dr.   J.   Croll on the Origin of Nebulce.              7
space occupied was far greater than was demanded either by
the temperature or the amount of heat received.
  If  we adopt the nebular hypothesis of the origin" of our solar
system, we must assume that our sun's mass, when in the con
dition of nebula, extended beyond the orbit of the planet
Neptune, and consequently filled the entire space included
within that orbit. Supposing Neptune's orbit to have been its
outer limit, which it evidently was not, it would nevertheless
have then occupied 274,000,000,000 times the space that it
does at present.   We shall assume, as before, that 50 million
years' heat was generated by the concussion. Of course there
might have been twice or even ten times that quantity ; but it
is of no importance what number of years is in the meantime
adopted.   Enormous as 50 million of years' heat          is,   it
                                                              yet
gives, as we shall presently see, only 32 foot-pounds for each
cubic foot. The amount of heat due to concussion being equal,
as before stated, to 100,000,000,000 foot-pounds for each
pound of the mass, and      cubic foot of the sun at his present
                             a
density of 1-43 weighing 89 Ibs., each cubic foot must have
possessed 8,900,000,000,000 foot-pounds.      But when the mass
was expanded to occupy 274,000,000,000 times more space,
which    would do when
        it                  extended to the orbit of Neptune,
                             it
the heat possessed by each cubic foot would then amount to
only 32 foot-pounds.
   In point of fact, however, would not even amount to that
                                  it                                 ;
for quantity equal to upwards of 20 million years' heat would
   a
necessarily be consumed in work against gravity in the expan
sion of the mass   ;all of which would. of course, be given back
in the form of heat as the mass contracted. During the ne
bulous condition        would not exist as heat, so that only
                       it
19 foot-pounds out of the 32 foot-pounds generated by con
cussion would then exist as heat.       The density of the ne
bula would be only -        '
                                  that of hydrogen at ordinary
temperature and pressure.      The 19 foot-pounds of heat in each
cubic foot would nevertheless be sufficient to maintain an ex
cessive temperature for there would be in each cubic foot only

             a
would be excessive, the quantity both of light and heat in each
cubic foot would of necessity be small. The heat being only
T'Y of a thermal unit, the light emitted would certainly Be ex

the existence of hydrogen and nitrogen in an incandescent

rature.   And it is scarcely conceivable that the temperature
could have been derived from the condensation of their masses.
When our sun was in the nebulous condition it no doubt was
self-luminous like other nebulae, and doubtless would have
appeared, if seen from one of the fixed stars, pretty much like
other nebulae as viewed from our earth. The spectrum would
no doubt have revealed in it the presence of incandescent gas.
At all events we have no reason to conclude that our nebula
was in this respect an exception to the general rule, and es
sentially different from others of the same class.     The heat
which our nebula could have derived from condensation up to
the time that Neptune was formed, no matter how far the
outer circumference of the mass may originally have extended
beyond the orbit of that planet, could not have amounted to
over      i      of a thermal unit for each cubic foot ; and the
 quantity of light given out could not possibly have rendered
 the mass visible.    Consequently the heat and light possessed
 by the mass must have been derived from some other source
 than that of gravity.
    We have further evidence that the heat and light of nebulae
 cannot have been derived from condensation.             there be             If
 any truth, as there doubtless      in Mr. Lockyer's view of the
                                        is,
 evolution of the planets, then the nebulae out of which these
 bodies were evolved must have originally possessed a very
 high temperature — temperature so high, indeed, as to pro
                            a
 duce perfect chemical dissociation of the elements.    In short,
 " the temperature of the nebulae," as Mr. Lockyer remarks                               *,
 " was then as
                great as the temperature of the sun        now."                    is
 Mr. Lockyer's theory        that the metals and the metalloids,
                                is
 owing to excessive temperature, existed in the nebulous mass
 uncombined — the metals, owing to their greater density, assu
ming the central position, and the metalloids keeping to the
outside.    The denser the metal the nearer would its position
be to the centre of the mass, and the lighter the metalloid the
nearer to the outside.    As a general rule the dissociated ele
ments would arrange themselves according to their densities                              ;
and it    for this reason, he considers, that the outer planets
         is
Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter, are less dense than
the inner planets, since they must have been formed chiefly of
metalloids, while the inner and more dense planets would
consist chiefly of metallic elements.
   " The
          hypothesis," says Mr. Lockyer,
                                            " almost worthlessis
unless we assume very high temperatures, because unless you
have heat enough to give perfect dissociation, you will not

law."     But the heat which produced this dissociation previous
to the formation of the planets could not have been derived
from the condensation of the nebula ; for the quantity so de
rived prior to the existence of the outermost planet must have
been infinitesimal indeed.           The heat existing in the nebula
previous to condensation must have come from some source ;
and we can conceive of no other save that which we have been
considering.
    The Gaseous State the first Condition of a Nebula. —           If the
foregoing be the true explanation of the origin of nebulae, it
will follow that the gaseous state will in most cases be the
first or original condition, and that a nebula giving a con
tinuous spectrum will only be found after it has condensed to
a considerable extent.
   The irresolvable nebulae which exhibit bright lines, in all
probability consist, as Mr. Huggins maintains, of glowing gas
without any thing solid in them. In short they are nebulae in
their first stage of development, and have not as yet condensed
sufficiently to become possessed of nuclei.             If  we adopt the
generally accepted       nebular    hypothesis,    I cannot   understand
how   we  can  consistently deny     the existence   of  gaseous nebulae;
for, according to the nebular hypothesis, the central nucleus
which constitutes a sun or star, and which exhibits a con
tinuous spectrum, was formed by condensation as surely as the
planets or the satellites have been.         Were we to go back suf
ficiently far in the past, we should come to a time when not
only our globe but the sun himself consisted of gaseous matter
only.     If  we admit this, then why not also admit that there
may    be nebulae   at the present time in a condition similar to
what our sun must formerly have been.
    The gaseous condition of nebulae seems to follow as a con
sequence from Mr. Lockyer's theory.              For in order that the
materials in the formation of a sun or star may arrange them
selves according to their densities, dissociation is requisite ;
but there can be no dissociation except in the gaseous con
dition.
    Star-Clusters. —The wide-spread and irregular manner in
which the materials would in many cases be distributed through
space after collision, would prevent a nebula from condensing
into a single mass.       Subordinate centres of attraction, as was
long ago   shown   by  Sir  William Herschel (in his famous memoir
on the formation of stars*), would be established, around which
the gaseous particles would arrange themselves and gradually
condense into separate stars, which would finally assume the
 condition of a cluster.

    Binary, Triple, and Multiple systems of stars will of course
be accounted for in a similar manner.
    It is conceivable that it may sometimes happen that by the
time the materials are broken up and dissipated into space,
there may not be sufficient heat left to convert the fragmente
into vapour.      In this case we should have what Professor
Tait has suggested, a nebula consisting of " clouds of stones."
But such nebulae must be of rare occurrence.
    Objections considered. — On a former occasion        I considered
one or two anticipated objections to the theory that stellar
light and heat were derived from motion in space.               But as
these objections have since been repeatedly urged by physicists
both in this country and in America,        I shall again briefly refer
 to them.
    Objection 1st.
                      " The existence of such non-luminous bodies
as the theory assumes is purely conjectural, as no such bodies
have ever been observed."           In reply, it is just as legitimate
 an inference that there are bodies in stellar space not luminous
 as that there are luminous bodies in space not visible.           We
 have just as good evidence for believing in the existence of
 the one as we have in the existence of the other.          Bodies in
 stellar space can only be known through the eye to exist.           If
 they are not luminous, they of course cannot be seen.             But
 we are not warranted on that account to suppose that they do
 not exist, any more than we have to suppose that stars do not
 exist which are beyond the reach of our vision.            We have,
 however, positive evidence that there are bodies in space non-
 luminous, as the meteorites and planets for example.              The
 stars are beyond doubt suns like our own ; and we cannot
 avoid the inference that, like our sun, they are surrounded by
 planets.    If so, then we have to admit that there are far more
 bodies in stellar space non-luminous than luminous.               But
 this is not all: the stars no more than our sun can have been
 dissipating their light and heat during all past ages ; their
 light and neat must have had a beginning : and before that
 they could not be luminous.          Neither can they continue to
 give out light and heat eternally ; consequently when their
 store of energy is exhausted they will be non-luminous again.
 Light and heat are not the permanent possession of a body.
 A body may retain its energy in the form of motion undimi-
 nished and nntransformed through all eternity, but not so in
 the form of heat and light.       These are forms of energy which
 are being constantly dissipated into space and lost in so far as
 the body is concerned.
    The conclusion to which we are therefore led is that there
 are in all probability bodies in stellar space which have not

               Dr. J.  Croll on the Origin of Nebulce.          11
yet received their store of light and heat, while there are
others which have entirely lost it.       The stars are probably
only those stellar masses which having recently had an en
counter have become possessed of light and heat.       They have
gained in light and heat what they have lost in motion, but
they have gained a possession which they cannot retain, and
when it is lost they become again what they originally were
— dark bodies.
    2nd. " We have no instances of stellar motions comparable
with those demanded by the theory."         A little consideration
will show that this is an objection which, like the former, can
hardly be admitted.       No body of course moving at the rate
of 400 miles per second could remain a member of our solar
system ; and beyond our system the only bodies visible are the
nebulae and fixed stars ; and they are according to the theory
visible because like the sun they have lost their motion — the
lost motion being the origin of their light and heat.        Their
comparatively small velocities are in reality evidence in favour
of the theory than otherwise ; for had the stars been moving
with excessive velocities this would have been adduced as
proof that their light and heat could not have been derived
 from motion lost, as the theory assumes.
    3rd. " suns or stars have been formed by collision of bodies
            If
 moving in space, proper motion can be none other than the
 unused and unconverted energy of the original components.
 And as stellar bodies are likely of all sizes and moving with
 all manner of velocities, it must often happen, from the unequal
 force of the impinging masses, that a large proportion of the
  original motion must remain unconverted into heat.        Conse
  quently some of the stars ought, according to the theory, to
  possess great velocities — which is not the cage, as none of the
  stars have a motion of more than 30 or 40 miles per second."
     I freely admit that, if it could be proved that none of the
  stars have a proper motion of more than 30 or 40 miles per
  second, it would at least be a formidable difficulty in the way
  of accepting the theory. For it would indeed be strange that
  amidst all the diversity of dimensions of heavenly bodies, it
  should invariably happen that the resultant movement of the
  combined masses should be reduced to such comparatively in
  significant figures.    But something more definite must yet
  be known in reference to the motion of the stars before this
  objection can be urged.
     All that we are at present warranted to assume is simplv
  that, of the comparatively few stars whose rate of motion has
  been properly measured, none have a greater velocity than 30
  or 40 miles per second, while nothing whatever is known

  12             Dr.   J.   Croll   on the   Origin of Nebula :
 with certainty    as to the rate       of motion of the greater number
 of the stars.
       There seems to be a somewhat prevailing misapprehension
   regarding the extent of our knowledge of stellar motions.
   Before we can ascertain the rate of motion of a star from its
   angular displacement of position in a given time, we must
   know its absolute distance.      But it is only of the few stars
   which show a well-marked parallax that we can estimate the
   distance; for it is now generally admitted that there is no re
   lation between the apparent magnitude and the real distance
   of a star. All that we know in regard to the distances of the
   greater mass of the stars is little else than mere conjecture.
   Even supposing we knew the absolute distance of a star and
   could measure its amount of displacement in a given time,
   still we could not be certain of its rate of motion unless we
   knew that it was moving directly at right angles to the line
  of vision, and not at the same time receding or advancing
  towards us ; and this we could not determine by mere obser
  vation.    The rate of motion, as determined from its observed
  change    of position, may be, say, only twenty miles a second,
  while its actual velocity may be ten times that amount.
     By spectrum-analysis it is true we can determine the rate
  at which a star may be advancing or receding along the line
  of sight independently of any knowledge of its distance. But
  this again does not give us the actual rate of motion, unless we
  are certain that it is moving directly to or from us.     If it ia
  at the same time moving transversely to the observer, its
  actual motion may be more than a hundred miles per second,
  while the rate at which it is receding or advancing, as de
 termined by spectrum-analysis, may not be 20 miles a
 second.     But in many cases it would be difficult to ascertain
 whether the star had a transverse motion or not. A star, for
 example, 1000 times more remote than « Centauri_( that             is,
 twenty thousand billion miles), though moving transversely to
 the observer at the enormous rate of 100 miles per second,
would take upwards of 30 years to change its position so much
as I", and 1800 years to change its position 1'; in fact we
should have to watch the star for         generation or two before
                                              a
we could be certain whether         was changing its position or
                                      it
not. And even after we had found with certainty that the
star was shifting, and this at the rate of          in 1800 years,
                                                        1'
we could not, without        knowledge of its distance, express the
                             a
angle of displacement in miles.           But from the apparent
magnitude      or brilliancy of the star, we could not determine
whether its distance was 10 times, 100 times, or 1000 times
that of « Centauri and consequently we could form no con-
                       ;

                  Dr.   J.   Croll on   the   Qrigin of Nebulce.             13
jecture as to the actual velocity of the star.                If
                                                         we assumed
 its distance to be 10 times that of « Centauri, this would give
 a transverse velocity of one mile per second.                If
                                                         we assumed
 its distance to    be  100   times that of   « Centauri, this would
 give 10 miles a second as the velocity, and if 1000 times, the
 velocity of course would be 100 miles per second.
    As there are but few of the stars which show a measurable
 parallax, and we have no other reliable method of estimating
 their distances*, it follows that in reference to the greater
 number of the stars, neither by spectrum-analysis nor by ob
 servation of their change of position can we determine their
 velocities. There does not, therefore, appear to be the shadow
 of a reason for believing that none of the stars has a motion
 of over 30 or 40 miles per second : for any thing that at
 present is known to the contrary, many of them may possess
 a proper motion enormously greater than that.
    There   is, however, an important point which seems to be
 overlooked in this objection, viz. that, unless the greater part
 of the motion of translation be transformed into heat, the
 chances are that no sun star will be formed.         It necessary is
 to the formation of a sun which           to endure for millions of
                                                is
 years, and to form the centre of          planetary system like our
                                               a
 own, that the masses coming into collision should be converted
 into an incandescent nebulous mass.            But the greater the
 amount of motion left unconverted into heat, the less             the  is
 chance of this condition being attained.         A concussion which
 would leave the greater part of the motion of translation un-
 transfonned, would be likely as a general rule to produce
 merely a    temporary star, which would blaze forth for          few   a
 years, or  a   few hundred years, or perhaps a few thousand
years and then die out.          In fact we have had several good
 examples     of   such  since   the time of Hipparchus.       Now,
 although   itmay be true that, according to the law of chances,
 collisions producing temporary stars must be far more nume
 rous than those resulting in the formation of permanent stars,
nevertheless the number of those temporary stars observable
 in the heavens may be perfectly insignificant in comparison
 with the number of permanent stars.           Suppose there were as
 many    as one   hundred    temporary   stars  formed for one per
 manent,    and  that  on an   average  each  should continue visible
 for 1000 years, there would not at the present moment be over
 half-a-dozen     ofsuch stars visible in the heavens.

It is true they will be of rare occurrence : but it is well that it

     The solution, after the titration, is filtered and the precipi
  tate washed.       The filtrate is free from copper and contains the
  nickel and zinc.       The absence of copper was proved in several
  experiments by evaporating to dryness and gently heating the
  residue, after which it was dissolved in a little dilute sulphuric
  acid and excess of ammonia added.             In no instance was any

are so far complementary in colour, that when they are mixed
together the resulting liquid, if moderately dilute, is hardly to
be distinguished from pure water.             I  conceived this fact might
be made the basis of a method for estimating nickel and cobalt,
and therefore undertook the following experiments.
     A large hollow prism filled with a moderately strong solu
tion of a nickel or cobalt salt was placed immediately in front
of the slit of the spectroscope ; and the thickness of the liquid
traversed by the light was regulated by moving the prism until
 the eye could most clearly determine the dark absorption-band
 caused by the metal in solution.            On referring to the accom
 panying diagrams, which show the absorption-spectra of the
 two metals, it will be seen that cobalt and nickel are almost
 exactly complementary in their relations to light.                The black
 band of cobalt is well defined at the edges, especially at the
 end nearest to the red ; while the absorption-bands of nickel
 are not so sharply defined, but fade away at each end.                   If the
                      Spectrum of light passed through Co.
                   Spectrum of light passed through   Ni  and Co.
                        Spectrum of light passed through Ni.
                                                                                -i
  The black parts here represent the bright parts of the spectrum, and vice vend.
  spectra were exactly complementary, on superimposing the
  nickel spectrum upon the cobalt spectrum, the dark part on
  the one would exactly cover the light part on the other.                 This,
  however, though nearly the case, is not exactly so ; for the
  bright band in the nickel spectrum overlaps the dark cobalt
  band at the end nearest to the red, although with diminished
  brilliancy. Consequently, when we employ a mixture of nickel
  and cobalt salts in solution, we do not get a uniformly dark
  spectrum, but an excess of light coming through at the part
  where the overlapping occurs, as seen in the diagram.                     This
  is why the solution obtained by mixing strong solutions of
   nickel and cobalt is not grey, but reddish brown in colour.
      Having so far demonstrated the complementary character of
   the two metals,    I next endeavoured to find in what proportions
   they  must   be   mixed in order to neutralize each other. For
   this purpose a tall glass cylinder (150 cubic centims. capacity),

 16          Mr. T. Bayley on   the Analysis of Alloys
 in which ammonia is estimated by Nessler's method, was em
 ployed.   Dilute standard solutions of pure nickel and cobalt
 having  been  carefully prepared, a measured quantity of cobalt
 solution was placed in the cylinder, and the nickel added from
 a burette until the neutral point was reached.     It is difficult
 by this method to distinguish the exact point of neutrality, but
 easy to determine that the colour-coefficient of nickel with
 regard to cobalt lies between 3'1 and 3-2.    That is to say, if a
 quantity of cobalt in solution be mixed with a solution con
 taining 3-1 times its weight of nickel, the cobalt colour will
 slightly predominate in the mixture, which will have a reddish
 tinge ; while if a solution containing 3'2 times its weight of
 nickel be added, the nickel colour will be slightly in excess
 and the solution will have an olive-green tinge.       It is only
 with dilute solutions containing not more than about 2-5
 grams of the metals per litre that it is possible to determine
the coefficient with this accuracy.
    I now sought for some method of indicating more exactly
the neutral point.     After several attempts, it was found that
the addition of ammonium carbonate to the solution of the two
metals affords a means of determining whether the slightest
excess of either metal is present.
    If we take 25 cubic centims. of solution containing '03125
gram of Co, and add to this 39'25 cubic centims. of solution
containing '098125 gram of nickel, the resulting liquid appears
perfectly colourless.    If we now dilute the mixed solutions to
 100 cubic centims., and transfer 25 cubic centims. of that so
lution, containing -0078125 gram of cobalt and -02453125
gram of nickel, to a tall glass jar, add 25 cubic centims. of
the solution of ammonium carbonate, described hereafter, and
then dilute to 150 cubic centims., the result is a liquid of deep
purple colour.    If we repeat this experiment, using in the first
instance -03125 gram of cobalt and -099375 gram of nickel,
the colour of 'the 150 cubic centims. is not purple, but of a
distinct blue colour.    The ammonium carbonate for this pur
pose must be neutral, as the excess of either base or acid
destroys the delicacy of the reaction.
    The solution of neutral carbonate, (NH4)2 C03, was prepared
as follows: — A few ounces of the commercial carbonate having
been dissolved in water, 10 cubic centims. of the solution were
neutralized by standard solution of sulphuric acid. The quan
tity of NH3 in the 10 cubic centims. was found to be -085
gram.     The quantity of C02 in an equal quantity of the solu
tion was found to be, in two experiments, -348 gram and -350
gram (mean '349 gram): the amount of C02 required to form
the neutral carbonate with -085 gram of NH3 being -110, it

                    containing Copper, Zinc, and Nickel.                       17
follows that there was an excess of C02 equal to "259 gram in
every 10 cubic centims. of the original solution of commercial
carbonate.          To neutralize this, 18 grams of ammonia were
required to be added to a litre of the commercial carbonate
solution.        This was furnished by 61*7 cubic centims. of am
monia solution (of sp. gr. -880).
    I   next endeavoured to determine whether the nature of the
salt of nickel or cobalt has any effect on the reaction.                     For
this purpose the following solutions were prepared: —
         CoCl2       .   .  1  cubic  centim.    = ¦00125 gram Co.
        NiCl2        .   .   1 cubic   centim.   = •0025       „   Ni.

         Co(N03)2        .   1 cubic   centim.   = •00125      „    Co.
         CoS04       .   .   1 cubic   centim.   = •00125      „    Co.
    The method of proceeding was as                  follows : — Into each of
five cylinders 25 cub. centims of the standard solution of
cobaltous chloride were placed ; to the first cylinder 39 cubic
centims. of the solution of nickelous chloride were added, to
the second cylinder 39-25 cubic centims., and so on, to the
fifth cylinder 40 cubic centims. of nickelous chloride being
added. Each cylinder was then made up to 100 cubic centims.,
and 25 cubic centims. out of each 100 cubic centims. placed
in a second series of cylinders.              To each of the second series
neutral ammonium carbonate (25 cubic centims.) was added,
and then sufficient water to make 150 cubic centims.                         The
results are expressed in the following Table:              —

    In two experiments, using in               the first solutions of CoCl2
and     NiS04     and  in  the  second   solutions  of CoCl2 and Ni(N03)2,
I   obtained exactly the same results ; so that the foregoing
Table expresses the results of these experiments.                Subsequently
experiments were made with the same quantities of the metals
in the following combinations : —
              Co(N03), with NiS04, Ni(N03)2 and NiCl2,
              CoS04 with Ni(N03)2, NiS04 and NiCl2.
    The results of these latter experiments were exactly the
same as those of the first experiments, so that the Table also
does equally well to express them.

18     Analysis  of Alloys containing Copper, Zinc, and Nickel.
    If the cylinders, after the addition of the ammonium car
bonate be allowed to stand, the differences of tint disappear in
a few hours, and a uniform deep purple-red tint is produced.
This is caused by the cobalt absorbing oxygen from the air
to form the double compounds of cobalt and ammonia. A
small quantity of a sulphite destroys the reaction, as it changes
the tint to a deep brown.          Thiosulphates and some other re-
ducing-agents do not act in this way.
    These experiments lead to the conclusion that the colour-
coefficient of nickel with regard to cobalt is 3' 16 in all cases,
or, in other words, that the tint of nickel and cobalt solutions
is independent of the acid radical in combination with the
metals, and depends only upon the metal in solution.
     It is evident that nickel and cobalt may be estimated by
means of this reaction.          As an example of its application to
this purpose,    I  give the .following account of the manner in
 which small quantities of nickel may be estimated.
    The nickel must be dissolved in an acid and the solution
 diluted to any convenient quantity, e. g. 50 or 100 cubic cen-
 tims. Into each of three cylinders '0078125 grm. of Co as
 CoCli is placed. This amount of cobalt is afforded by 6'25
 cub. ccntims. of the standard CoCl2 solution.             Calling the
 cylinders No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, we place in No. 1 '024531
grm. of nickel in solution, and in No. 3 '0248458 grm. To
 the three cylinders we then add 25 cubic centims. of the stan
dard ammonium carbonate. Cylinder No. 2, which contains
only cobalt solution and ammonium carbonate, is then made
up nearly to 150 cub. centims., and No. 1 and No. 3 are filled
 up to that quantity.       Cylinder No. 1 has then a purple tinge,
while cylinder No 3 has a blue tinge.               By adding from a
burette the solution whose strength we wish to determine to
No. 2 until its tint is intermediate between No. 1 and No. 3,
we make with great accuracy the required determination.              In
all cases tho cylinders should be held, whilst under compari
son, with their lower extremities at some inches distance
above a sheet of white paper.          Three experiments that by no
means reached the highest limit of accuracy, gave the follow
ing results : —
                 Ni in solution.        Ni found.
                  -02469 grm.       (1) -02425

                                         -02466 =mean.
    It  is evident that a similar plan      of estimating cobalt would
be still more accurate on account          of the higher colour-effici
ency of that metal.

                  On Picoline and its Derivatives.                  19
   The partially opaque brown solution obtained by mixing
strong solutions of nickel and cobalt might,        I  think, be used
for making standards for the purposes of colorimetrical ana
lysis.  For instance, the brown solution mixed with a few
drops   of potassic bichromate cannot be distinguished from
Nesslerized ammonia. Probably the tests used to compare
the solutions of steel in Eggertz's process for the estimation of
carbon might be made in a similar manner. They would
have the advantage of being permanent.
   After the determination of the copper and nickel by the
above methods, the zinc is obtained by difference.          If  lead is
present  in  the  alloy, it is  separated by the evaporation with
sulphuric acid.

ganate an acid, or a mixture      of acids, was obtained, the silver
salt of which contained 45'82 per cent. of silver, corresponding
to a molecular weight of 257, assuming the acid to be dibasic.
Since that time I have ascertained that the silver salt of the
acid giving the above percentage of silver is not a pure com
pound, but a mixture of an acid and a neutral salt of at least
two acids of the same formula.
    Oxidation of Lutidine. — About 100 grams of lutidine,
C7H,N, boiling from 152° to 155° C., were oxidized with
potassium permanganate in a tinned iron vessel in precisely
the same manner as that described for picoline.           After com
plete oxidation the manganese oxide was removed by filtra
tion, and the filtrate was distilled to recover unoxidizcd luti
dine; less had escaped oxidation than was the case with
picoline, probably on account of its higher boiling-point, as
well as of its being more easily oxidized than its lower homo-
logue. The highly alkaline solution of the products of oxi
dation was then evaporated to dryness, and digested with
absolute alcohol by means of an apparatus which permitted
the hot alcohol continually to drop on the mixture of salts.
After three or four days the insoluble residue consisted of
nearly pure potassium carbonate, the organic salts having
dissolved in the alcohol.      The alcohol was then removed by
evaporation.     The residue had an extremely persistent bitter
taste, almost comparable with that of strychnine.              It was

 dissolved in water, neutralized, and precipitated while hot with
 lead nitrate, less being used than was necessary to combine
 with all the acid present.          The precipitate was white and
 flocculent.   When decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen
 it yielded a liquid from which, on concentration, dicarbo-
 pyridenic acid separated out in its usual form of hair-like
 needles, and when purified by crystallization from water was
 obtained in its two other crystalline forms, viz. naphthalene-
 like plates and short thick crystals. Its purest form, the
 thick crystals were converted into the silver salt, after deter
 mination of the water of crystallization.          It contained 1O94
 per  cent, of water;   and  the   silver salt, on ignition, was found
 to contain 56'57 per     cent,  of silver. Dicarbopyridenic acid,
 in the same crystalline form, crystallizes with 9-83 per cent.,
 or one molecule of water; and its silver salt contains 56'69
 per cent, of silver. The silver salt was almost completely
 insoluble in boiling water, and was gelatinous and very bulky.
 The filtrate from a boiling solution deposited a few amorphous
 flocks on cooling.
    The calcium salt, prepared by addition of calcium chloride
 to a hot solution of the ammonium salt, crystallized in thin
 plates, usually grouped together in masses.              It contained
 17-47 per cent, of water, which it lost at 150°, and the an
 hydrous salt 19-96 per cent, of calcium.               C7 H3 N04 Ca .
 2£ H2 0 requires 18'GO per        cent, of water, and the anhydrous
 salt 19'51 per cent, of calcium.         I had not obtained the salt
 crystallized with water before ; that described in my last
 memoir was anhydrous.          On evaporation of the solution of
the calcium salt, needles were precipitated which were an
 hydrous and on analysis yielded 19'01 per cent, of calcium.
The formula of this acid is certainly C7 H5 N04 ; and from its
 crystalline forms it appears to be identical with the dicarbo
 pyridenic acid discovered by Professor Dewar.               The yield
 was somewhat more than ten grams.               \Vhether it is derived
 from lutidine by oxidation, or from a possible impurity of
picoline in the lutidine,    I  am unable to decide.
    The mother liquor of the dicarbopyridenic acid contained
a mixture from which an acid crystallizing in groups of aci-
cular crystals radiating from a common centre was deposited,
but not in sufficient quantity for complete examination.         From
consideration of    its  crystalline form it is probably identical
with one shortly to be described.
    The remainder of the solution of potassium salts, from which
                                 '
the dicarbopyridenic       acid was precipitated in combination
with lead, was treated with excess of lead nitrate. A copious
flocky precipitate came down, from which the acids were

           Dr. W. Ramsay on Picoline and its Derivatives.                  21
liberated as usual by treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen.
The lead sulphide was well washed with boiling water ; the
filtrate and washings were evaporated ; and on cooling, a white
substance deposited mixed with spear-like crystals.                   After a
long    series   of fractional   crystallizations    from  water  three   dis
tinct acids were obtained, of which             I  have investigated two ;
the third was unfortunately lost.            As these two have the same
 percentage composition as Dewar's dicarbopyridenic acid,                    I
 propose to name that acid «-dicarbopyridenic acid.
     The white substance, mentioned above, consisted chiefly of
 a sparingly soluble acid, which          I shall call ^-dicarbopyridenic
 acid.
     The acid depositing from the mother liquor of the (3-acid,
 in groups of spear-like crystals, shall be distinguished as
 y-dicarbopyridenic acid.
     ^-Dicarbopyridenic         acid, C7 H5 NO4. — This acid, as has
 already     been   mentioned, separates out as a white crystalline
 powder when its aqueous solution is allowed to cool.                  It was
 purified by repeated crystallization from water. When viewed
  under the microscope it presents the appearance of truncated
  octahedra, grouped together in masses.                 The acid dried at
  100° decomposes at 244-245°, frothing up, and giving off
  gas.     It is very sparingly soluble in water ; 0'2 gram, dis
  solved by boiling with about 200 cubic centimetres of water,
  crystallized out after standing for some hours. It is rather
  more soluble in alcohol, and dissolves sparingly in ether.
  When heated on platinum-foil it molts, effervesces, and gives
  off a smell resembling that of pyridine.            It was analyzed, with
  the following results      : —

 or, compared with hydrogen, 29'22.              The molecular weight
 of   C5 H5N    is 79, and of 2CO2       88.    Adding these together
 and dividing by ii we get 27-8.          It is therefore clear that the
 above equation is correct, and         that /8-dicarbopyridenic acid
 decomposes into pyridine and             carbonic anhydride at the

  ferric chloride it gave a white flocculent precipitate soluble
  in hydrochloric acid ; the precipitate, on addition of ammonia,
  turned reddish-brown in colour, and apparently changed to
  ferric hydrate.       With mercurous nitrate it gives a bulky
  white precipitate ; with copper sulphate a light blue precipi
  tate, turning darker on drying ; with lead nitrate a heavy
  white crystalline precipitate after some time ; and with silver
  nitrate white crystalline flocks very sparingly soluble in water.

   Silver salt. The silver salt of 3-uicarbopyridenic acid,
when precipitated by adding silver nitrate to a solution of
the acid, contains 43'56 per cent, of silver, and is probably a
mixture of neutral and acid salt.         It was this which led me,
in my last paper (Phil. Mag. Oct. 1877), to state that the
molecular weight of the acids from lutidino was higher than
that of the picoline acids.        Two analyses of the silver salt
prepared in this    manner     showed it to contain 43-56 per cent.
and 44-05 per    cent, of silver. When prepared by adding silver
nitrate to the ammonium salt, it has the formula C7 H3 N04 Ag2,
as the following analyses prove : —

                 Silver... 0'l 825 gram, = 56'23 per    cent.

         C7  H3 N04 Ag2 contains 56'69 per cent, of silver.
    This silver salt is not nearly so bulky as that of a-dicarbc-
pyridenic acid, but comes down in flocks.          It is very sparingly
soluble in hot water, and crystallizes out on cooling in tufts
of microscopic needles. When heated it evolves the usual
smell of pyridine.        It does not blacken on exposure to light.
    Methyl ether.    —  Prepared by cohobating the silver salt with
methyl iodide.        It is a very deliquescent white solid, crystal
lizing in needles, and soluble in water, alcohol, and ether.
    Chloride. — One gram of /3-dicarbopyrideuic acid was dis
tilled from a small retort along with 2-7 grams of phosphoric
chloride.       The mixture liquefied before heat was applied.
The distillate was fractionated.          After the oxychloride had
distilled over at 110° the thermometer rose rapidly to 209-270°,
and remained stationary while the chloride distilled.               The
distillate solidified to a mass of white needles, meltirtg at
49°, and remaining liquid long after the ordinary temperature
had been regained.
     'y-Dicarbopyridenic and, C7 H5 N04. — y-Dicarbopyridenic
acid is much more soluble then the /3-acid, and crystallizes
out from the mother liquor of the latter.               After repeated
recrystallization, to free it from the /3-acid, and from a still
more soluble bitter substance, it was obtained in a pure
state.     It forms tufts of spear-like crystals springing from a
common nucleus. When its solution in hot water is allowed
to cool, it crystallizes from nuclei which form on the sur
 face of the liquid.       After being dried by exposure to air it
has a satin-like lustre.          It is moderately soluble in water
at 18°; 100 cubic centimetres of its saturated solution left,
on evaporation to dryness, 1-1580 gram of dry acid.                 It is
easily soluble in alcohol and ether.             Like its two isome-
rides, it decomposes when heated into pyridine and carbonic
anhydride about 241-245°.             To ascertain if it decomposed
in the same manner as the /3-acid,          I determined the vapour-
density of the mixture of pyridine and carbonic anhydride
yielded by the acid at the boiling-point of sulphur.            To save
space    I shall  omit   the details  of the  determination, and shall
merely state that the number found was 28-4, compared with
hydrogen.        The number required by the equation

          Dr. W. Ramsay on Picoline and its Derivatives.           25
is 27"8.       The equation is thus proved to represent what
happens      when 7-dicarbopyridenic         acid is decomposed    by
heat.
    7-Dicarbopyridenic        acid gave the following numbers on
 analysis  : —
       I. Taken             0-3075 gram.
          Loss at 100°, 0-0475 gram, = 15-44 per cent. H2 O.
     The remainder, 0" 2 600 gram, on combustion gave
          C02              0-4929 gram, = 51-70 per cent. C.
          H20             0-0740 gram,= 3-16 per cent. H.
      II. Taken           0-3582 per cent, of dry acid.
          C02              0-6697 gram, = 50-98 per cent. C.
          H20             0-0974 gram,= 3-02 per cent. H.
    III.  When      dried for one night over sulphuric acid,
             0-3085 gram of the acid lost at 100° 0-0380 gram,
              = 12-31 per cent, of H20.
     IV.  After being dried for      a long time in air, 0-2290 gram
              lost at 100° 0-0235 gram,= 10-26 per cent. H2 O.
     G7 H5 N04 contains 50-30 per cent. C. and 3-00 per cent. H.
 C7 H5 N04 . H2 O contains 9-73 per cent. H2 O ; with liH2 O,
 13-91 per cent,; and with 2 H2 O, 17-78 per cent.
     The acid, when dried in air, appears to contain less than
 two molecules of water, and when dried over sulphuric acid,
 more than one molecule.
     Reactions of y-Dicarbopyridenic acid. —A cold saturated
 solution of the acid gave no precipitate with the following
 salts : — Ca Cl2, even after addition of ammonia ; Ba Cl2,
 MgS04, Zn S04, Cd Cl2, Hg Cl2, Ni (N03)2, Co(N03)2. Ferric
 chloride causes a white flocculent precipitate, soluble in
 hydrochloric acid, and converted into ferric hydrate by am
  monia ; mercurous nitrate gives a bulky white precipitate ;
  stannous chloride, a flocculent precipitate ; copper sulphate, a
  whitish blue precipitate ; lead nitrate, a white precipitate,
 which disappears at first, probably owing to formation of an
  acid salt, but on addition of more lead salt it becomes perma
  nent; silver nitrate gives a white flocculent precipitate,
  slightly soluble in hot water.       Ferrous sulphate gives a blood-
  red coloration.

      Silver salt. — The silver salt comes down on addition of
  silver nitrate to a solution of the acid as a flocculent preci
  pitate, closely resembling that of the /3-acid, but not nearly
  so gelatinous or bulky as that of the «-acid.             It is very
  sparingly soluble in water.

     Gj H3 N04 Ag2 contains 56-69 per cent. of silver.
     y-Dicarbopyridenyl chloride. —The chloride was prepared in
 the usual manner ; it boiled at 265°.          On exposure to air it
 turns bluish-violet,    and   liquefies. It solidifies with great re
 luctance at the ordinary temperature ; and yet its melting-
 point is at 88-89°.      It appears to be much more easily decom
 posed by    water  than  the chlorides of the «- and /3-acids, for it
 turns liquid at once     on  treatment with cold water.
                        —
     Sitter substance. The bitter substance already mentioned
 remained in the mother-liquor of the #- and 7-dicarbopyridenic
 ueids.    It was partially separated by adding lead or silver
nitrates to a neutral solution ; for both these salts are soluble
 in acid. The lead salt, when decomposed by sulphuretted
 hydrogen, gave a solution which was evaporated to a syrup.
The bitter substance does not crystallize from water or alcohol ;
it is extremely soluble in both these solvents, but less easily
soluble in ether.      It is an acid; its barium salt is a syrup,
 which dries up to a vitreous mass over sulphuric acid.           The
acid, as well as its salts, give off the usual smell of pyridine
when heated, and also give a red coloration with ferrous
sulphate. It was unfortunately lost, after it had been separated
in a nearly pure state.

     Even if structural formula? be discarded, it is evident from
  the analogy between pyridine and chinoline, and benzol and
  naphthalene, that a number of isomerides are to be expected
  when two external groups replace two atoms of hydrogen in
  pyridine.     In the case of benzol, three isomerides are known
  under such conditions ; and it is to be expected that pyridine,
  a more complicated substance than benzol, owing to its con
  taining an atom of nitrogen, should yield more than three
  isomeric bodies.
      Now, that a-, /3-, and <y-dicarbopyridenic acids are isomeric,
  and not identical, is rendered highly probable by the following
   considerations : — the /3-acid is much less soluble in water than
   the other two modifications ; as a rule its salts are much less
   soluble ; its crystalline form is different.         Copper sulphate
   produces no precipitate with the a -acid, whereas the other two

give whitish blue precipitates. With ferric chloride, the         and

                                     ;
deliquescent needles.      The chloride of the a-acid boils at
284°, that of the /3-acid at 269-270°, and the chloride of
the 7-acid at 265°.      The melting-points of the chlorides are
respectively :— a, 60-5-61°      ;   496

   Dipyridine. — In purifying some oils, afterwards to be de
scribed,  I   obtained  a  considerable quantity of dipyridine,
Ci0 Hi0 N2, and purified    it by crystallization from hot water.
It presented the appearance of long hair-like white needles.
As its vapour-density had only been once determined,              was
                                                                   it

            by a Sprengel's air-pump.          After numerous distil-
 ations, a fraction was separated, which boiled in vacuo at
fn-oduced
145-155°, and in air at 295-305°.             Two determinations of
the vapour-density of this oil gave the following numbers :
                    I. 81-55;             II. 82-80.
   These numbers agree sufficiently well with the vapour-den
sity of dipyridine, 79.
    On analysis it gave the following results : —
    I. Taken,   0-3935 gram.
          C02             1-1272 gram, = 78-10 per cent. C.

                                               6'38 per cent. H.
     Both carbon and hydrogen in every case are too high; and
 I have been unable to conjecture any reason for the excess.
 I  am inclined to believe, from the vapour-density, as well
 as from analyses of some compounds of the base, that it really
 has the formula     of dipyridine.
     Isodipyridine is a yellow viscid oil, of 1'08 specific gravity.
 It boils at 145-155 in a vacuum, and at 295-305° at the
 ordinary pressure.       It does not solidify on exposure to the
 cold produced by      a mixture   of snow and salt, nor is crystalli
 zation induced by addition of crystals of dipyridine.                It
 dissolves very sparingly in water, and communicates to it its
 characteristic heavy basic smell ; it mixes in all proportions
 with alcohol and ether.
     Isodipyridine hydrochloride. — When a solution of isodipy
 ridine is evaporated to dryness with hydrochloric acid, redis-
 solved in alcohol, and allowed to remain over sulphuric acid,
 small, hard, Avhite crystals are deposited.             With platinic
 chloride,  the   solution   of this  salt  gives a  yellow crystalline
 precipitate of the platinichloride.      A determination of platinum
 was made with the following results : —

this brown oil into a brilliant red powder.         The powder was

The small amount of isodipyridine at my disposal made it
impossible to prepare more salts.          In distilling this base at
the atmospheric pressure, the last few drops fell on a red-hot
surface; and on opening the bulb a strong smell of pyridine
was perceived.        This base therefore is apparently converted
into pyridine by exposure to a high temperature.
     The methyl-iodide of dipyridine, prepared from pure
 crystallized base, is also a red powder ;      I  failed entirely to
 observe the white needles described by Dr. Anderson in his
 account of the base.
     Dipicoline, C12 Hu N2. — Dipicoline was prepared by Dr.
 Anderson by allowing picoline to remain in contact with
 metallic sodium. A bottle, set aside by him in 1874, contained
 a black, tarry mass ; on exposure to moist air, it gradually
 became yellow, while the sodium unattacked by the picoline
 oxidized.     After the whole had become yellow, water was
 added, and the oil, which sank to the bottom, was well washed
 to remove sodium hydrate.         After an attempt to purify it by
 distillation with water-vapour (which did not succeed, owing
 to the slight volatility of the base), the oil was dried, and dis
 tilled alone.     A large quantity of picoline came over at 134° ;
the temperature then rose rapidly to 280°.           A small fraction

             Dr. W. Kamsay on Picoline and its Derivatives.              31
    distilled between 280° and 310° ; but by far the largest por
    tion distilled between 310° and 320°.           There was very little
    remaining     ; so that  the fraction  last mentioned  constituted the
    bulk of the oil.         After two more distillations, the portion
    boiling at 310-320° being collected separately, the base was
    considered sufficiently pure for investigation.
        Its vapour-density was determined twice:
                           0-0420 gram    x 1543500 x 14-47
                                                                  =95-30.

         Dipicoline, CI2 Hu N2, is a yellow oil, closely resembling
     dipyridine in appearance.          Its smell is similar, but slightly
     different.     It mixes in all proportions with alcohol and ether,
     and is sparingly soluble in water, to which it communicates
     its taste and smell. Its specific gravity is 1-12, rather more
     than that of dipyridine.        It boils at 310-320° at the ordinary
     pressure.      It unites  with  acids to form salts which have little
     tendency to crystallize.
         The hydrochloride, after standing in a syrupy condition
     over sulphuric acid for some days, showed a tendency to
     crystallize at the edge.       The platinichloride has the formula
                           C12HuN2.2HCl.PtCl4.

    Oxidation of Dipicoline. — Five grams of dipicoline were
oxidized in the usual manner with potassium permanganate.
The acids when separated from their lead salts, consisted : — (1)
of an acid, almost totally insoluble in water, alcohol, and ether,
and separating in amorphous flocks on evaporation of the
solntion containing other acids, in which it dissolves sparingly ;
it gives oft' a smell of the polymerized bases when heated on
platinum foil ; and (2) a mixture of acids (certainly containing
no a-dicarbopyridenic acid), of which the quantity at my dis
posal was too small to admit of fractional crystallization.    These
acids also evolved a smell resembling that of dipyridine, when
heated.     The lead and silver salts of these acids are white
insoluble precipitates.     It is probable, from the fact of these
acids evolving the smell of dipyridine when heated, that
dipicoline, when oxidized, yields      a polymeride of dicarbopyri-
denic acid.
                        General Conclusions.
    1.  Bases of the series Cn   H2FI_5  N are tertiary bases ; they
 are not attacked by nitrous acid ; nor do they unite with more
 than one molecule of a halogen compound of an alcohol
 radical.
    '2. They are unsaturated compounds, but have no great
 tendency to form addition-compounds.           The addition-com
 pounds are divisible into three classes : — (a) compounds in
 which the base combines directly with an acid to form a salt ;
 (b) compounds in which the base unites with two atoms of a
                                                        I
 halogen, e. g. picoline chloriodide, C6 H7 N . Cl ; and (c)
 those in which a salt combines with two atoms of a halogen,
 in the pyridinc series, as, for example, the din iodide of picoline
                                   I
 methyl-iodide, C6 H7 N . CH3 . L, and with six atoms of a
 halogen, as in the case of the hexiodide of dipicoline methyl-
 iodide, Cu Hu N . (CH3 I), I6.
     3. Like the paraffins, they are not attacked by acid oxidizing
 agents in the cold. They differ from paraffins by withstanding
 such action even at a high temperature ; and this is probably
 owing to the increased stability given to the molecule by
 nitrogen, which renders them basic, and imparts to them the
 property of forming salts. The heat of formation of these bases
 is doubtless very high ; and when a still greater amount of
 heat is evolved by their combination with acids, the sum of
     Phil. Mag. S. 5' Vol. 6. No. 34. July 1878.              D

34       Dr. W. Bamsay on Picoline and its Derivatives.
heat-units evolved by the union of the carbon, hydrogen, and
nitrogen, plus that evolved by the formation of their salts, is
probably greater than that evolved by their oxidation.
    4. It is consequently only in alkaline solution that they can
be oxidized.      In this case, the amount of heat evolved by the
acid formed by oxidation uniting with the alkali increases the
sum of thermal units evolved by their oxidation to a number
larger than that evolved during the formation of the base.
The amount of heat evolved, moreover, is not increased by
that arising from a union of the base with an acid.
    5. At least three isomerides are formed by replacement of
two atoms of hydrogen in pyridine by carboxyl, COOH. From
analogy with benzol, and consideration of the greater com
 plexity of the molecule of pyridine, it is highly probable that
more than three exist.         These .acids are produced by oxidizing
picoline and its higher homologues, and probably also by
oxidizing pyridine.         This behaviour is analogous to that of
benzol ; for benzol yields acids containing more than six atoms
of carbon when oxidized. From picoline, C6H7N, it was to
be expected that monocarbopyridenic acid, Cs H4 N . COOH,
should be produced ; this acid has been obtained only by the
 oxidation of nicotine ; a-dicarbopyridenic acid is the only one
produced in large quantity by the oxidation of picoline.
 When lutidine, C7 H9 N, is oxidized, a mixture of at least three
isomeric acids of the formula C5 H3 N (CO . OH)2 is formed.
This would imply the existence of as many different isomeric
 lutidines : and indeed it is highly probable that such iso
 merides exist ; for great difficulty is experienced in separating
isomeric liquids, especially (as in this case) when the presump
 tion is that their boiling-points are almost identical.
    6. These isomerides may be represented in graphic formulae
 as on page 27.      A closed chain appears best suited to express
 the behaviour of the bases and the isomeric compounds de
rived from them.        I  failed in several attempts to convert the
dicarbopyridenic      acid                                  I
                            into its alcohol (from which had hoped
to obtain a baso), owing to the instability of the acid at a high
 temperature and the small yield of aldehyde when the acid
 was distilled with calcium formate.          I  had hoped to achieve
the formation of the base by the following stages : —
 C5 H3  N (CO . OH) ;       C5 H3  N (CHO)2 ; Cs H3 N (CH2 OH)2 ;
 C.,H3N.(CH2C1)2;           and C5 H3 N (CH3)2.
    From similar reasons, an attempt to prepare lutidine,
C7 H8 N, by distilling the methyl ether of the a-acid proved
abortive ; in every case, pyridine was formed.             In spite of
these failures, it appears to me probable that picoline is methyl-
pyridine,    lutidine   dimethyl-pyridine,     etc., — the presence of

                On Salt Solutiont and Attaelied Water.                              35
nitrogen, as conjectured in (3), giving stability to the
molecule, and preventing the oxidation of the methyl-groups
to carboxyl.
   7. On treatment with sodium, these bases are polymerized,
no hydrogen being evolved by the action of the sodium on
the base.       An addition-product is consequently formed,
probably by two atoms of sodium being taken up by each mole
cule of base ; on coming into contact with a fresh molecule
of base, the sodium leaves the first molecule, which has thereby
its affinities free for union with another similarly placed.                            I
am very doubtful if any compound of picoline and sodium is
formed. Certainly sodium does not combine with dipicoline ;
for that base can be freed from water by heating it to a high
temperature with metallic sodium.
    8. In conclusion,            I
                           would remark the analogy between the
furfurol and pyridine groups.        That they are closely related
appears    very  probable.   An   attempt to effect the conversion
of furfurol, CSH402, into pyridino through the following
series of reactions, failed owing to the instability of furfuryl
 chloride.
    C5H402,           C.H.O,, C.H.OC1, C5H5ONH2, C.H.N.
    Furfurol.         Furfuryl           Furfuryl          Furfuryl amine   Pyridine.
                      alcohol.           chloride           (unknown),
                                        (unknown).
   The furfurol group, from its unstable nature, is probably
analogous to the higher homologues of acetylene, and is best
represented by an open chain ; whereas the pyridine group,
from its stability, and from the number of isomeric deriva
tives obtained from                    is,
                            like benzol, best pictured by a closed

   The analyses were of different liquid residues after two crops
of cryohydrate had been separated from each. The water-
worth derived from the mean of these two analyses appears to
be 1463.       As cryogens, SrO H2 0 or SrO when mixed with
ice did not lower the temperature below 0°. A very slight fall
to — 0°-09 was obtained on slaking SrO with water and allow

ice.   Such a fall, however, can scarcely be recognized.
   §  169.   Hydrate of Calcium. — This body, as is well known,
presents the very interesting peculiarity of being more soluble
in cold than in hot water. On further cooling the solution
saturated at a certain temperature above 0°, one gets an im
perfectly saturated solution ; and on still further cooling, ice
appears.      But if the solution be kept saturated during cooling,
which can be well effected by continued stirring with some hy
drate precipitated by rise of temperature in another quantity,
the cryohydrate appears at — 0°'15.

The analyses were of different liquid residues after two crops

corresponds to the relation

cent. (the mean of two analyses of the cryohydrate at — 0°'15
gave 0-3634 per cent, of UaO H2 O), lime is 3£ times more
soluble in water at — 0°'15 C. than at 100 C.

that here calcium lies between barium and strontium.         They

not exhibit the characteristic opacity of cryohydrates.      They
became milky in a carbonic acid and ether cryogen, but did
not seem even then to assume the characteristic opacity.         A
trace of this true opacity appeared with BaO H2 O.

                                       — The cryohydrate of this
salt forms at — l°-7.    Two analyses of the same residual liquid

The mean indicates the formula
                    K4FeCy6+ 151-6 H2O.
The temperature of the cryogen is — 1°'61.         If this body had
been the first to be experimented on in the direction which
has led to the discovery of the cryohydrates, it is possible that
the whole class might have escaped notice, because, when the
cryohydrate is allowed to melt, a considerable quantity of yel
low salt (terhydrate or subcryohydrate) falls down unless the
liquid is kept well agitated. Though not peculiar to this salt,
it is perhaps more marked with it than with any other. To
be viewed almost as a corollary to the above fact is the follow
ing one concerning the same salt. When a solution of the
strength of the cryohydrate is cooled, there may be a simul
taneous formation of ice and some hydrated or anhydrous
 ferrocyanide : the one floats ; ihe other sinks.         As before
pointed out in other cases, this independent separation of the
 constituents of the cryohydrate is entirely prevented by pla
cing in the solution a fragment of previously formed cryohy
drate.
                                        — At a temperature of

 — 3°-9 a saturated solution of this salt began to give up its
cryohydratc, having previously given up a less hydrated salt.
Though several determinations of the amount of salt in the
residual liquid were made both by evaporation over a water-
bath and drying in vacua over sulphuric acid, the results dif
 fered from one another by several per cent.       The lowest was
 19-8 per cent., the highest 24 per cent.     The temperature of
 the cryogen is — 3°-y C.      The ambiguity in the amount of
 water in the cryohydrate finds its counterpart in the similar
 ambiguity in the water of crystallization of the ordinary salt.

of the residue where the basin is in contact with the bath. As
soon as these began to appear the further heating was stopped.

The water-worth is accordingly 72'83. As a cryogen the
temperature of — 4°-5 is obtained.
   § 177. Oxalate of Potassium.
                                   — The temperature at which
the cryohydrate formed was found to be — 6° 3.         On evapo
rating 3-2862 grams in a platinum capsule, igniting, and
quickly cooling on a metal slab, 0-5790 of the carbonate was
obtained ( = 17-62 per cent.).
   In another analysis, 3'1500 grams, on evaporation to dry-
ness on a water-bath, gave 0-6684 oxalate (21 '22 per cent.Y
This gave on ignition 0-5531 of carbonate (17-56 per cent.),
which by treatment with hydrochloric acid gave 0-5958 of
chloride of potassium (18-88 per cent.).       The percentage of
carbonate agrees closely with that of the first analysis. The
percentage of chloride differs only by 0'07 from that required
on the conversion of 17-56 of carbonate.          Hence it would
seem that with due cure oxalate of potassium may safely be
estimated as carbonate, notwithstanding the hygroscopic cha
racter of the latter salt.  It also appears (contrary to state
ments sometimes made) that oxalate of potassium does not
retain any of its water of crystallization when its solution is
evaporated to dryness at 100° C. ; for the 17-56 per cent. of
carbonate obtained is equivalent to 21-12 per cent. of oxalate,
which only differs by 0'l per cent. from 21'22, which was
found.    The water-worth (deduced from the chloride of potas
sium) is 17-3.
   The temperature of the cryogen is — 6°'2.
   § 178. Fluoride of Sodium.
                                 — This salt, like several other
salts of sodium, is troublesome when attacked from the side of
saturated solutions, because there appears to be a subcryohy-
drate. This salt also exhibits the very rare property of being
almost equally soluble at all temperatures between 100° and
 — 3°-9.   On cooling a hot saturated solution to —2°, nothing
separates.    Between — 2° and —4° an ice-like body is formed.
The true cryohydrate appears to be formed at — 5°-63 ; for this
temperature is preserved till the whole is solid and opaque.
Fluoride of sodium, as a cryogen, gives — 3°-2. The cryohy
drate has not been further examined.

    § 180. Acetate of Zinc.
                                    — A boiling saturated solution was
allowed to cool to the atmospheric temperature ( + 15°). The
residual liquid was drained from the separated crystals and
introduced, together with a few crystals, into a stoppered
bottle. After keeping in ice for nine hours with frequent agi
tation, all sign of further crystallization ceased.                The zinc was
estimated by precipitation with carbonate of sodium.                        It was
thus found that the strength at 0° was 23 per cent.                       This so
lution, when artificially cooled, yields fern-like crystals at
 — 5°"9 ; these gradually became opaque, the opacity forming
in a frond-like manner ; the whole became dry at the above
temperature.         An analysis of the residual liquid, after two
crops of cryohydrate, showed that the cryohydrate had sensibly
the same composition as the solution saturated at 0° C; for
        grms.              Oxide.

the true cryohydrate is formed, and the temperature rises to
 — 11° and remains constant till all is solid.
    The solubilities at 0° and 20° are those given by Kremers.
These and the determination for —11°, when plotted in the
usual way, are found to lie on the same straight lino.   H. ScbifF
found at 19°'5 a saturated solution to contain t>3'5 per cent,
five-hyd rated, or 45-8 per per cent, anhydrous salt.         As a
cryogen, the temperature — 10° was reached.
    § 182. Citric Add. — This body presented many difficulties;
but as these difficulties occur again with most organic acids
of high molecular weight, a special study was made of it. It
is peculiarly liable in aqueous solution to supersaturation of
the most persistent kind, especially when the solution is at a
low temperature.         At temperatures and under conditions
which are capable      of evolving the cryohydrate, the solution
assumes sometimes an almost colloidal form, and shows no signs
of eliminating solids unless other means besides mere lowering
of temperature are employed.
    From solutions ranging from 10 to 40 per cent, of anhy
drous acid, ice is liberated ; and this continues to 42'26 per
cent., from which solution a cryohydrate separates at — 9-2.
The following is a somewhat detailed account of the behaviour
of solutions containing a greater percentage of acid than 40.
    Two grams of a solution gave 0'8525 of citric acid, or 42'28
 per cent.   This gives a solid at — 9°'2, which at first floats on
 the residual liquid.     The solid consists of massive white ag
 glomerated    crystals.   The crystals are hexagonal, but pre
 sent rhoniboidal elements, causing the edge of each crystal
to be deeply and regularly serrate.         When they melt, the
rhomboidal crystals are themselves resolved into long slender
prisms. A large quantity of such a solution retained its com
 position when nine tenths of it had been removed by solidifi
 cation, nevertheless, if such a solution be kept perfectly still
for many hours at — 9°, a few ice spicula may be formed.
    Other solutions, containing respectively 45, 45'9, 50, 50'7,
 and 51'5 per cent, of the anhydrous acid, were examined.        It
 is only this latter which yields, on cooling, distinct quantities
 of the original salt: this it does at — 6°, but only if a particle
 of the original salt be introduced and by diligent stirring.
 When undisturbed, this 51'5 solution may be cooled to — 19C-5
 without any solidification.     So prone is this acid to exhibit
 supersaturation, that solutions both weaker and stronger than
the 42'62 may be enriched on partial solidification.        Thus a
50-per-cent. solution, though already stronger      than the  cryo
hydrate, may become still stronger by the separation of ice at
 — 17°.    There is therefore a large region of double supersa

                           and Attached Water.                                    43

curve, both continuing their courses for an exceptionally long
distance.
    For the solubility at 0° C, a solution saturated above 0° C.

three days.

 upon the temperature ; but, of course, the more nearly the
 initial temperature is to the final one the less is the quantity
 of liquid formed.

         V. On     the  Physical Action of the Microphone.
                          By Prof. Hughes.*
                      read on the 9th of May before the Royal
IN Society,
       the  paper
                 I  gave a general outline of the discoveries 1 had
made, the materials used, and the forms of microphone em
ployed in demonstrating important points.               I   have made a
great  number      of  microphones,   each   for  some  special purpose,
varying in form, mechanical arrangement, and materials. It
  *
    Communicated    by the Physical Society, having been read June 8, 1878.

                       Action of the Microphone.                    45
would require too much time to describe even a few of them ;
and as    I  am anxious in this paper to confine myself to general
considerations,     I will take it for granted that some of the forms
of instrument and the results produced are already known.
    The problem which the microphone solves is this — To in
troduce into an electrical circuit an electrical resistance, which
resistance shall vary in exact accord with sonorous vibrations
so as to produce an undulatory current of electricity from a
constant source, whose wave-length, height, and form shall
be an exact representation of the sonorous waves.         In the mi
crophone we have an electric conducting material susceptible
of being influenced by sonorous vibrations ; and thus we have
the first step of the problem.
    The second step is one of the highest importance : it is es
sential that the electrical current flowing be thrown into waves
of determinate form by the sole action of the sonorous vibn-
 tions.     I resolved this by the discovery that when an electric
 conducting matter in a divided state, either in the form of
 powder, filings, or surfaces, is put under a certain slight pres
 sure, far less than that which would produce cohesion and
 more than would allow it to be separated by sonorous vibra
 tions, the following state of things occurs. The molecules
 at these surfaces bemg in a comparatively free state, although
•electrically joined, do of themselves so arrange their form,
 their number in contact, or their pressure (by increased size
 or orbit of revolution) that the increase and decrease of elec
 trical resistance of the circuit is altered in a very remarkable
  manner, so much so as to be almost fabulous.
     The problem being solved, it is only necessary to observe
  certain general considerations to produce an endless variety of
  microphones, each having a special range of resistance.
     The tramp of a fly or the cry of an insect requires little range
  but great sensitiveness ; and two surfaces, therefore, of chosen
  materials under a very slight pressure, such as the mere weight
  of a small superposed conductor, suffice ; but it would be un
  suitable for a man's voice, as the vibrations would be too
  powerful, and would, in fact, go so far beyond the legitimate
  range that interruptions of contact amounting to the well-
  known " make and break
                                 " would be
                                             produced.
     A man's voice requires four surfaces of pine charcoal, as is
  described in my paper to the Royal Society, six of willow
  charcoal, eight of boxwood, and ten of gas-carbon.               The
  effects, however, are far superior with the four of pine than
  with either the ten of gas-carbon or any other material as yet
  used.     It should be noted that pine wood is the best resonant
  material we possess ; and it preserves its structure and quality

  46                  Prof. Hughes on the Physical
 when converted into the peculiar charcoal           I  have discovered
  and described.
      It is not only necessary to vary the number of surfaces and
  materials in accordance with the range and power of the vibra
  tions, but these surfaces and materials must be put under more
  or less pressure in accordance with the force of the sonorous
  vibrations.      Thus for a man's voice the surfaces must be
 under a far greater pressure than for the movements of insects.
  Still the range of useful effect is very great, as the boxes
 which 1 have specially arranged for man's voice are still sen
 sitive to the tick of a watch.
     In all cases it should be so arranged that a perfect undu-
 latory current is obtained from the sonorous vibrations of a
  certain range. Thus, when speaking to a microphone trans
 mitter of human speech, a galvanometer should be placed in
 the circuit, and, while speaking, the needle should not be de
  flected, as the waves of + and — electricity are equal, and
 are too rapid to disturb the needle, which can only indicate a
 general weakening or strengthening of the current.               If the
 pressure    on the  materials is not sufficient,  we  shall have a con
 stant succession of interruptions of contact, and the galvano
 meter-needle will indicate the fact.         If  the pressure on the
 materials is gradually increased, the tones will be loud but
 wanting in distinctness, the galvanometer indicating interrup
 tions; as the pressure is still increased, the tone becomes
 clearer, and the galvanometer will be stationary when a maxi
 mum of loudness and clearness is attained. If the pressure be
 further increased, the sounds become weaker though very
 clear ; and as the pressure is still further augmented the
 sounds die out (as if the speaker were talking and walking
 away at the same time) until a point is arrived at where there
 is complete silence.
     When the microphone is fixed to a resonant board, the lower
contact should be fixed to the board, so that the sonorous vi
brations act directly on it. The upper contact, where the
pressure is applied, should be as free as possible from the in
fluence of the vibrations, except those directly transmitted to
it by the surfaces underneath ; it (the upper surface) should
have its inertia supplemented by that of a balanced weight.
This inertia     I find necessary to keep the contact unbroken by
powerful      vibrations.    No spring can supply the required
inertia ; but an adjustable spring may be used to ensure that
the comparatively heavy lever shall duly press on the contacts.
     The superposed surfaces in contact may be screwed down
by an insulated screw passing through them all, thus doing
away with the lever and spring ; but this arrangpment is far

                      Action of   the   Microphone.             47
more difficult to adjust, and the expansion by heat of the screw
causes a varying pressure.       It is exceedingly simple, however,
easily made, and illustrates the theoretical conditions better
than the balanced lever     Ihave adopted in practice.
    In order to study the theoretical considerations, and that with
the most simple form of microphone freed from all surrounding
mechanisms, let us take a flat piece of charcoal 2 millims. thick
and 1 centim. square, and, after making electrical contact by
means of a copper wire on the lower surface, glue that to a
small resonant board or, better for the purpose of observation, to
a block of wood 10 centims. square.         Upon this superpose one
or more similar blocks of charcoal, the upper surface in com
munication with a wire, the lowermost surface resting flat, or as
nearly so as possible, on the lower block.
    The required pressure is
put on the upper block ; and
while in this state the two
may be fastened together
with glue at the sides, or,
better, by an insulated screw.
The pressure can then be
removed, as the screw or             I
glue equally preserves the
force. Let the lower piece be called A and the upper B :
when we subject this board to sonorous vibrations, we can
not imagine an undulatory movement of the actual wave
length in such a mass, that is a length comparable with the
real wave-length of the sonorous wave, which may be several
 feet.   Nor can we imagine a wave of any length without
admitting that the force must be transmitted from molecule to
molecule throughout the entire length : thus any portion of a
wave, of which this block represents a fraction, must be in
molecular activity.      The lower portion of the charcoal A,
being part      of the  block    itself, has this molecular action
throughout, transmitting      it  also to the upper block.   How is
 it that the molecular action at the surfaces of A and B should
 so vary the conductivity or electrical resistance as to throw it
into waves in the exact form of the sonorous vibrations ?
 It cannot be because it throws up the upper portion, making
 an intermittent current, because the upper portion is fastened
 to the lower, and the galvanometer does not indicate any in
 terruption of current whatever. It cannot be because the
molecules arrange themselves in stratified lines, becoming
 more or less conductive, as then surfaces would not be re
 quired — that  is, we should not require discontinuity between
 the blocks A    and  B ; nor would the upper surface be thrown

48                Prof. Hughes on the Physical
up if the pressure be removed, as sand is on a vibrating glass.
The throwing-up of this upper piece 13 when pressure is re
moved proves that a blow, pressure, or upheaval of the lower
portion takes place : that this takes place there cannot be any
doubt, as the surface, considered alone (having no depth),
could not bodily quit its mass.     In fact, there must have been
a movement to a certain depth ; and      I am inclined to believe,
from numerous experiments, that the whole block increases
and diminishes in size at all points, in the centre as well as
the surface, exactly in accordance with the form of the sono
rous wave.    Confining our attention, however, to points on
A and B, how can this increased molecular size or form pro
duce a change in the electrical waves ?       This may happen in
            —
two ways : -first, by increased pressure on the upper surface,
due to its enlargement ; or, second, the molecules themselves,
finding a certain resistance opposed to their upward move
ment, spread themselves, making innumerable fresh points of
contact. Thus an undulatory current would appear to be pro
duced by infinite change in the number of fresh contacts.
I  am inclined to believe that both actions occur : but the latter
seems to me the true explanation ; for if the first were alone
true, we should have a far greater effect from metal powder,
carbon, or some elastic conductor, such as metallized silk, than
from gold or other hard unoxidizable matter ; but as the best
results as regards the human voice were obtained from two sur
faces of solid gold,    I am inclined to view with- more favour
the idea that an infinite variety of fresh contacts brought into
      by the molecular pressure affords the true explanation.

  t has the advantage of being supported by the numerous
forms of microphone I have constructed, in all of which      I can
fully trace the effect.
    1 have been very much struck by the great mechanical
force exerted by this uprising of the molecules under sonorous
vibrations.   With vibrations from a musical box 2 feet in
length,  I found that one ounce of lead was not sufficient on a
surface of contact 1 centim. square to maintain constant con
tact ; and it was only by removing the musical box to a dis
tance of several feet that  I was enabled to preserve continuity
of current  with a moderate pressure.      I  have spoken to forty
microphones at once ; and they all seemed to respond with
equal force.   Of course there must be a loss of energy in the
conversion of molecular vibrations into electrical waves ; but
                     I
it is so small that have never been able to measure it with
the simple appliances at my disposal.      I have examined every
portion of my room — wood, stone, metal, in fact all parts — and
even a piece of india-rubber : all were in molecular move

                        Action of  the  Microphone.                 49
ment whenever        I spoke.             I
                                 As yet have found no such insu
lator for sound     as gutta-percha is for electricity.    Caoutchouc
seems to be the best ; but      I  have never been able by the use of
any amount at my disposal to prevent the microphone report
ing all it heard.
     The question of insulation has now become one of necessity,
as the microphone has opened to us a world of sounds, of the
existence of which we were unaware.             If we can insulate the
 instrument so as to direct its powers on any single object, as
 at present    I  am able to do on a moving fly, it will be possible
 to investigate that object undisturbed by the pandemonium of
 sounds which at present the microphone reveals where we
 thought complete silence prevailed.
      I have recently made the following curious observation : —
 A microphone on a resonant board is placed in a battery-cir
 cuit together with two telephones.            When one "of these is
 placed    on  the resonant   board, continuous sound will emanate
                                      a
 from the other. The sound is started by the vibration which
 is imparted to the board when the telephone is placed on it..;
  this impulse, passing through the microphone, sets both tele
 phone-disks in motion; and the instrument on the board,
 reacting through the microphone, causes a continuous sound
  to be produced, which is permanent so long as the indepen
  dent current of electricity is maintained through the micro
 phone. It follows that the question of providing a relay for
  the human voice in telephony is thus solved.
      The transmission of sound through the microphone is per
  fectly duplex ; for if two correspondents use microphones as
  transmitters and telephones as receivers, each can hear the
  other, but his own speech is inaudible ; and if each sing a dif
  ferent note, no chord is heard. The experiments on the deaf
  have proved that they can be made to hear the tick of a watch,
  but not, as yet, human speech distinctly ; and my results in
  this direction point to the conclusion that we only hear our
  selves speak through the bones and not through the ears.
       However simple the microphone may appear at first glance,
  it has taken me many months of unremitting labour and study
  to bring to its present state through the numerous forms each
  suitable for a special object.         The field of usefulness for it
   widens every day.       Sir Henry Thompson has succeeded in
   applying it to surgical operations of great delicacy ; and by its
  means splinters, bullets, in fact all foreign matter, can be at
   once detected.      Dr. Richardson and myself have been experi
   menting    in lung- and heart-diseases ; and although the applica
   tion by Sir H. Thompson is more successful,           I do not doubt
   that we shall ultimately succeed. There is also hope that

tiplex telegraphy will profit by its use ; and there is hardly a

of my investigations     I have used Prof. Bell's wonderfully sen
sitive telephone instrument as a receiver, and that it is owing
to the discovery of so admirable an appliance that have beenI
enabled to commence and follow up my researches.
VI.   On a Cause for the Appearance of Bright Lines in the
   Solar Spectrum. By RAPHAEL MELDOLA, F.R.A.S., F. C.S.,
   $e*
       July
IN and       1877   Professor Henry Draper
           (probably) nitrogen       are present
                                                  showed that oxygen
                                                   in the sun's atmo
sphere,  the spectral lines of       these gases appearing as bright
lines in the solar spectrum.
   The photograph accompanying Professor Draper's paper f
shows that the oxygen-lines are bright, although not conspi
cuously so, upon a less-luminous background.
   The discoverer of this most important fact in solar chemistry
does not offer any complete explanation of the exceptional
behaviour of the lines of these elements, but remarks that " it
may be suggested that the reason of the non-appearance of a
dark lino may be that the intensity of the light from a great
thickness of ignited oxygen overpowers the effect of the pho
tosphere, just as, if a person were to look at a candle-flame
through a yard thickness of ignited sodium-vapour, he would
only see bright sodium-lines and no dark absorption-lines.
Of course such an explanation would necessitate the hypo
thesis that ignited gases such as oxygen give forth a relatively
large proportion of solar light."
   The oxygen-spectrum referred to in the above-mentioned
paper is the well-known
                             " line spectrum " seen when powerful
disruptive sparks pass through the gas.              Dr. Schuster has

                 ofBright Lines in      the Solar Spectrum.              51
shown with considerable certainty to be present as dark lines
in the solar spectrum.
     Since the publication of Professor Draper's discovery,                I
have given much attention to the consideration of a cause for
the apparently anomalous brightness of the oxygen-lines ; and
in the present paper           I  venture to advance an explanation
which has recommended itself as being worthy of notice, not
only because it offers a reconciliation of the known solar spec
trum with the generally accepted views of the constitution of
the sun's atmosphere, but likewise because it furnishes a sug
gestive hypothesis for the attack of many other obscure prob
lems in solar physics.
     1.   I shall throughout this paper consider it to bo established
 that the gaseous envelopes surrounding tho sun succeed each
 other in the following order, commencing with the lowest : —
                         1.    Photosphere.
                         2.    Reversing layer.
                             '
                         3.    Chromosphere.
                         4.    Coronal atmosphere.
     I  also assume the truth of the hypothesis, first advanced by
 Johnstone Stoney *, who showed, from purely theoretical con
 siderations, that in the sun's atmosphere the various elements
 must extend to heights which are, broadly speaking, inversely
 as their vapour-densities.         This view has, in my belief, been
 substantially     confirmed     by subsequent observation. Thus ni
 trogen and oxygen, having the respective densities 14 and 16
 (H = l), would extend to a great height in the solar atmo
 sphere, rising above sodium, calcium, and magnesium, and
 having exterior to them the unknown substance giving the D3
 line (helium), hydrogen, and the element giving the coronal
 line "1474."
     2. Two suppositions can be made concerning the sun's tem
 perature. In the first place, it may be assumed that tho
  temperature is so enormously elevated that no chemical com
 pound is anywhere capable of existing in his atmosphere ; in
  other words, dissociation may be considered to be complete.
  In the next place, it may be supposed that the temperature
  falls off sufficiently at some region of the outer portion of the
  sun's atmosphere for certain chemical combinations to take
 place.
     3. Let us first assume that the temperature            of the sun is so

 52         Mr. R. Meldola on a Cause for the Appearance
 great that there is perfect dissociation throughout his whole
 atmosphere.        Under these circumstances free oxygen would
 exist in the presence of electro-positive elements ; and, in ac
 cordance with Stoney's hypothesis, both this element and
 nitrogen (if present) would extend to a considerable height in
 the sun's atmosphere, rising as a necessary consequence, into
 regions which are cooler than that stratum which is cool
 enough to reverse the spectral lines of those metals having the
 smallest molecular mass, viz. Na, Ca, and Mg*.                     Professor
 Draper's      suggestion    that  the   enormous     thickness     of incan
 descent oxygen may overpower             the   light of  the   photosphere,
 can only hold good, when considered in connexion with this
 hypothesis, if the temperature of the upper portions of the
 oxygen atmosphere does not differ to any great extent from
 that of the lower and hotter portions. When, however, we
 bear in mind the comparatively low vapour- density of oxygen,
 and consider at the same time to what an enormous height the
 hydrogen atmosphere extends, it appears probable that the
 height reached by oxygen would be such that the temperature
 of the upper portions of this gas would be considerably lower
than that of the subjacent layers ; so that any excess of radia
 tion over that of the photosphere given out by the hottest
 portions of the incandescent oxygen would be obliterated by
 the absorption of the cooler portions above.
     [The same reasoning can be applied if we suppose that the
 temperature of the oxygen falls off at some particular level ;
 so that above this boundary the state of molecular aggregation
 of the gas corresponds to Dr. Schuster's "compound-line"
 spectrum, while below this boundary the greater heat of the
 gas resolves its molecules into the atoms giving the ordinary
 line-spectrum.       The effect of this state of affairs is practically
the same as would be brought about by annihilating a certain
portion of the upper oxygen layers, since the two different
molecular states of the gas give totally dissimilar spectra. We
are thus reduced to an oxygen atmosphere of smaller extent,
and0the foregoing reasoning obtains.]
     Angstrom suggested f that the non-appearance of the lines
    » Stoney has shown
                          (Proc. Roy. Soc. xvii. p. 14) that a gas or vapour,
even when present in only small quantity, will nevertheless extend to
nearly its full height in the solar atmosphere.
    t He remarks (liecherches sur le spectre Solaire, Upsal, 1809, p. 37) that
it is " tres-probable o^ue la tempe'rature lSieved du soleil ne suffit pas pour
produire les raies bnllantes de 1'oxyg^ne et de 1'azote, et que par conse--
quent, memo en supposant que ces corps existent actuellement dans le
soleil, ils ne doivent pourtant pas occasioner de raies obscures dans le
spectre solaire."    He further suggests that oxygen and nitrogen may exist
in the corona.

                of Briijht Lines in     the Solar Spectrum.               53
of oxygen and nitrogen in           the solar spectrum might be ac
 counted for by supposing that, at the temperature of the sun,
the specific absorptive power of these gases may be insufficient
to reverse their spectra.         This view, however, equally fails to
account for the brightness of the lines in question.
    4. Let us now make the not improbable assumption that the
temperature of the sun's nucleus, photosphere, and reversing
layer is so great that dissociation is perfect throughout these
regions, but that somewhere in the higher regions, or above
the chromosphere*, the temperature falls off sufficiently for
some kinds of chemical combination to take place — say, in the
present instance, for oxygen to combine with hydrogen.
 Under these circumstances we should have, concentric with
and exterior to the chromosphere, a zone of combustion where
oxygen and hydrogen, already at a very elevated temperature,
enter into combination and become thereby raised to a state
of more vivid incandescence f- All elements which, by virtue
 of their small vapour-density, extended into the region of com
bustion, would bo raised to incandescence by contact with the
 flaming gases, if not actually taking part in the combustion.
 Thus, according to the present hypothesis, we should not ex
pect to find in the solar spectrum the bright lines of elements
Laving a high vapour-density.
    5. The possibility of combination taking place in the higher
 regions of the sun's atmosphere is admitted by Stoney |, who
states that " gases in the solar atmosphere which are kept
asunder by the temperature of its lower strata may be able to
combine in the cooler regions above."                 Such combination,
although arising from the cooling-down of gases previously at
a temperature of dissociation, would nevertheless be attended
with the evolution of heat, and would possess the character of
true combustion.         Professor Draper also remarks, in the paper
   » It is generally admitted that the true height of the chromosphere is
considerably greater than that seen by means of the telespectroscope,
since the amount of dispersion necessary to weaken the scattered light of
our atmosphere must weaken and shorten the hydrogen-lines by which
the chromosphere is revealed.
   t  It is well known that the oxyhydrogen flame does not show the
lines of either of the burning gases.    In the sun, however, the conditions
are probably very different     The combining gases may be largely diluted
with other inactive gases.     Furthermore the pressure, as shown by the
researches of Frankland and Lockyer (Proc. Roy. Soc. xvii. p. 288), is
apparently far less in the upper regions of the chromosphere than in our
own atmosphere.      Both these causes would conspire to raise the point of
ignition of the gases in question, so that a much higher temperature would
be necessary to bring about combination than if they were undiluted ar.d
under greater pressure.
   f Proc. Roy. Soc. xvii. p.

   54        Mr. R. Meldola on a Cause for          the  Appearance
   before referred to*, that "diffused and reflected light of the
  outer corona could be caused by such bodies (oxygen com
  pounds) cooled below the self-luminous point."
       6. The following considerations appear to give support to
   the view that oxygen extends into regions sufficiently reduced
  in temperature for combustion to take place : —
       The region which is called the chromosphere is distinguish
  able as such through what may be called an optical accident :
   it is that zone of incandescent hydrogen which is rendered
  visible by the telespectroscope ; the true boundary of the hydro
   gen atmosphere lies far above the visible chromosphere : and
   from this latter zone outwards the temperature falls off rapidly.
  Now it has been well established by observation, that metals
  of great molecular mass, such, for example, as those of the iron
  group, arc frequently thrown high up into the chromosphercf.
  Thus, if gases of great vapour-density are occasionally injected
  into the chromosphere, gases composed of molecules of com
  paratively small mass, such as those of oxygen and nitrogen,
  would probably extend permanently into regions far above the
  chromosphere, and which are therefore at a much lower tem
  perature than that zone.
      The elements chiefly concerned in producing selective ab
  sorption in sun-spots, as shown by the local thickening of their
  spectral lines, are all elements of high vapour-density com
 pared with oxygen — viz. Na, Mg, Ca, J3a, Fe, Ni, Cr, and Ti :
  from this it appears that the disturbances producing these
                  must extend low down in the chromosphere. The
    and-spectra occasionally seen in the nuclei of sun-spotsf
 Ehenomena
 appear to indicate that in these regions the temperature is
 sometimes sufficiently reduced to admit of the formation of

     % Professor Young states (' Nature,' vii. p. 109) that in the spectrum of
 a sun-spot he observed " between O and 1) some very peculiar shadinj's,
 terminated sharply at the less refrangible limit by a hard dark line, but
fading out gradually in the other direction nt a distance of 3 or 4 Kirch-
hofFs scale-divisions." This answers in all respects to the spectrum of a
compound bodv: indeed this excellent observer subsequently suggests
that these bands " seem to point to such a reduction of temperature over
the spot-nucleus as permits the formation of gaseous compounds bv ele-
menta elsewhere dissociated."       In the spectrum of a sun-spot recently
observed at the Royal Observatory, Circenwich (Monthly Notices Rov.

   sphere   above   the spot layer is low enough to permit of che-
   mical combination taking place*, even when the portions of
  the atmosphere concerned are swept down into the subjacent
  spot-cavity, it follows that the layer into which oxygen ex
  tends (which, as we have seen, must be far above the spot
  layer) would likewise be cool enough to allow of the formation
  of compounds.
      7. It will help to give greater precision to the hypothesis
 of a zone of combustion, if we follow the course of a ray of
  light supposed to be emitted by the photosphere and received
  in the spectroscope of a terrestrial observer. Passing through
 the reversing layer, the ray undergoes that selective absorption
  which gives rise to the Frannhofer lines ; and if its spectrum
 could be examined immediately after its emergence from this
 layer, the oxygen- (and nitrogen-) lines would appear dark,
 but less conspicuous than the metallic lines, for reasons which
 will be entered into later on in this paperf.              After traversing
 the chromosphere the ray reaches the zone of combustion, in
 which region, owing to the increased temperature, the lines of
 all elements which extend so far would tend to be reversed
 into bright lines of radiation i.
              "
      [I say tend to be reversed," because whether they would
 actually become so depends upon the specific absorptive power
 of the elements concerned for the rays in question. Thus, let
 there be two gases, A and B, of which the spectral lines are
 A«, Ap, Ay and BB, Bp, By respectively ; and let the specific
 absorptive power of A bo greater at a given temperature than
     * If these band spectra are regarded as the spectra of elements in the
 stage of molecular complexity corresponding to the molecule giving the
 band spectrum of iodine, or Roscoe and Schuster's new spectra of Nn and
 K (Proc. Roy. Soc. xxii. p. 362), the argument remains unaffected, since
 these band-spectrum-giving     molecules are spectroscopically equivalent to
the molecules of compound bodies.
    t The question here arises as to what order of oxygen-spectrum wo
 should expect to find at the temperature of the reversing layer.             Dr.
 Schuster seems inclined to believe that the temperature may be such as
                           "
to give the " compound       spectrum of this gas (' Nature,' vol. xvii. p. 148).
The recent observations of Lockyer upon the calcium-spectrum (Proc.
 Roy. Soc. xxiv. p. 352) tend to show that the temperature of this layer
is intermediate in dissociation-power between that produced by a small
                                                                  I

to believe would produce a state of molecular dissociation corresponding

    f It is possible that the temperature of the chromosphere may fall off
at some particular level, so as to givo above such boundary the " com
pound" oxygen-spectrum.         Should this be the case, the higher portion of
the chromosphere may obviously be left out of consideration, so far as re
lates to its absorbing action on the line-spectrum of oxygen.

56       Mr. E. Meldola on a Cause for          the    Appearance
that of B.   Imagine A and B to       be raised to incandescence,
and placed in front of a source of   white light at a higher tem
                                                    " first
perature, and let this combination    be called the         system."
On examination we should see the     continuous spectrum crossed
by dark lines, Aa, Ap, Ay, B,,, Bp, and By, of which the first
series would be darker than the second.       Now conceive the ra
diation of the whole system to be weakened by general absorp
tion or by removal to a distance.      The lines of B would first
disappear ; so that if we imagine a mixture of A and B (" second
system ") to be heated to incandescence        and placed between
the first system and the observer, the B lines might appear
bright on a background of continuous spectrum, while the A
lines remained dark, although weakened by the radiation of
the second layer of mixed gases.]
    Thus, if the sun's envelopes exterior to the zone of combus
tion could be stripped off, we should see the solar spectrum
with the lines of oxygen (and nitrogen) bright, and the hy
drogen-lines probably dark but much fainter than now seen.
     8. The reversal of tho oxygen- (and nitrogen-) lines into
bright lines by the increased temperature of the region of
combustion is rendered possible, even with the intense light of
the photosphere as a background [and                  if,
                                                  as most probably
would be the case, tho temperature of the said region of com
 bustion is   lower than that of, tho photosphere], because the
light radiated by the latter has undergone almost its maximum
 amount of weakening before reaching tho zone of combustion,
 not only on account of the distance of this last region from the
 photosphere, but also because of the absorption, both selective
 and general, which the light has undergone in passing through
 tho intervening reversing layer and chromosphere.
     9. We have next to turn our attention to that part of the
 sun's atmosphere exterior to the zone of combustion, in order
 to account for the fact that the hydrogen-lines appear so in
 tensely dark while the oxygen-lines are bright.       The explana
 tion whichI     venture to suggest  is based upon a wide survey
 of tho general spectroscopic characters of the elements.
     10. At the temperature of incandescence, the characteristic
 lines in the spectra of any elements which are compared may
 be of very different intensities.   Thus Cappcl has shown*, by
a   series of quantitative determinations made at the temperature
 of Bunsen burner and of an induction-spark, that very dif
     a
  ferent amounts of tho metals experimented upon can be de
 tected by means of the spectroscope.       The characteristic lines
  of an element are those which Lockyer has shown to be the
  longest.   Interpreting such facts by the aid of (he molecular

                 of Bright Lines in the Solar Spectrum.                   57
theory of gases (and making due allowance for the fact that
the characteristic lines of the spectra being compared may
occur in parts of the spectrum not visualiy comparable so
far as regards intensity), we should say that some kinds of
molecules can have certain internal vibrations more readily
excited than is tho case with other kinds.             From the relation
ship which exists between radiation and absorption, it follows
that molecules which have the most sensitive radiative orga
nization have likewise the most sensitive absorptive organi
zation.
      11. The non-metals are distinguished, as a group, from the
 metals by the greater complexity of their spectra (which more
 resemble the band spectra of compound bodies), and also by
 their comparative insensitiveness to the spectroscope.               Many
 of the metals are known to give band spectra at low tem
 peratures ; but these break up into line spectra at high tem
 peratures.        On the other hand, the band spectra of many
 non-metals bear temperatures high enough to break up the
 band spectra of metals without being resolved into line spectra.
 We might thus have a mixture of two vapours, one metallic and
 the other non-metallic, at the temperature of incandescence,
 the former giving a line spectrum and the latter a band spec
 trum.       If  we imagine the temperature of such a mixture of
  vapours to bo raised to the point at which the band spectrum
  of the non-metal breaks up, we should get a line spectrum
  from both elements ; but the metallic lines would be more
  intense* than those of the non-metal, owing to the greater
  sensitiveness of the metallic molecule.          We should thus have
  realized the conditions laid down in a former paragraph (7),
  where A would then represent the metallic, and B the non-
  metallic vapour.
       12. It now remains to show the applicability of the fore
  going principles to the case under consideration.
       The oxygen and hydrogen of the sun's atmosphere will, for
  the sake of simplicity, be exclusively considered.            These gases
  represent the metallic and non-metallic vapours of the last
  paragraph.       The photosphere, reversing layer, and chromo
                             " first system " of paragraph 7 — i. e. the
  sphere represent the
      » " In a tube containing both nitrogen and aqueous vapour, the lines of
   hydrogen (spectrum    II order) made their appearance at the same time as
   the spectrum of bands (I order) of nitrogen, whence it follows that tho
   lines of hydrogen are visible in a temperature in which tho lines of ni
                                       '
   trogen do not appear" (Schellen's Spectrum-Analysis,' p. 171).     So also
   Frankland and Lockyer found that m a tube containing hydrogen and
   nitrogen, the lines of the latter gas under certain conditions of pressure
   could be made to disappear entirely, while the hydrogen-lines under all
   conditions remained visible (1'roc. Hoy. Soc. xvii. p. 4o4).

58            Mr. R. Meldola on a Cause for    the   Appearance
source   of white light, with the mixture of two vapours of dif
ferent specific absorptive powers in front.      The oxygen and
hydrogen of the zone of combustion represent the second layer
of incandescent gases of paragraph 7, supposed to have been
placed in front of the first system, the total radiation of which
is imagined to have been weakened by general absorption or
by removal to a distance.      It has been shown in paragraph 8
that the total radiation of the photosphere has probably under-
       a great amount of weakening from both these causes,
  hus the spectrum of a ray which reaches the zone of com
fone
bustion would exhibit (supposing the zone of combustion and
all exterior to it to be stripped off) the lines of oxygen and
hydrogen dark, but those of the former much fainter than those
of the latter. The action of the incandescent gases of the
zone of combustion upon such a spectrum would be to reverse
the oxygen lines and to weaken those of hydrogen.
    The temperature of the region outside the zone of combus
                                                                *
tion must fall off, so that any oxygen which might there exist
would be in the state of molecular aggregation corresponding
to the compound spectrum, and would thus be without action
on the bright-line spectrum of this gas, but would give rise to
the dark lines of its compound spectrum. The hydrogen of the
region now under consideration by further absorption inten
sifies the lines of this gas.   Thus the solar spectrum as now
known is shown to be in complete accordance with the hypo
thesis here advanced.
    The hypothesis of a zone of combustion in the higher regions
of the sun's atmosphere, as already stated, furnishes suggcs-
gestions for the explanation of many observed facts in solar
physics hitherto unaccounted for.
     Iwill first call attention io the intense brilliancy of the lino
])3 in the spectrum of the chromosphere, and the extreme
i'aintncss of the corresponding dark line in the solar spectrum!.
If  we consider to what an enormous height this element ex
tends, bearing also in mind that it must consequently reach
into comparatively cool regions, and that its radiative (and
therefore absorptive) powers are very great, it seems impro-
   9 It may bo supposed thnt the oxygen atmosphere terminates \vith the.
zone of combustiou, in which case l)r. Schuster's new oxygen-spectrum
must be produced by the absorptive action of the gas in the upper regions
of the chromosphere (see also note to paragraph   7).
 t   This line was seen in July 1877 by II. C. Russell at Sydney.     The
observer states that " it   difficult line to see, nnd only to be made out
                            is
                             a
with high powers."     The greatest dispersion of the spectroscope em
ployed -was equal to eighteen O-P-prisuu (Month. Not, Roy. Astr. Soc.

bable that the vast thickness of this gas which must be tra
versed by a ray of light emitted by the photosphere should be
barely sufficient to reverse its spectrum.               If
                                                   the existence of
a zone of combustion be granted, however, this region becomes
the source of radiation of all gases which extend so far.     Thus
in the case of the D3 element, which reaches nearly the same
level in the sun's atmosphere as hydrogen, the stratum of gas
exterior to the zone of combustion                 is,
                                              on the present view,
alone concerned in reversing the line under consideration and           ;
this stratum may be of insufficient thickness to produce any
marked absorption.     The " 1474

                                        substance, however, which
rises far above hydrogen, appears to exist in sufficient quan
tity exterior to the supposed region of combustion (or its spe-
cifac absorptive power         sufficiently great) to produce
                                   is                                          a
marked reversal in the solar spectrum*.
   The hypothesis advanced in the present paper does not ne
cessarily imply (at least under existing solar conditions) the
production and accumulation of large quantities of compound
bodies in the higher regions of the sun's atmosphere.          The
zone of combustion may be, so to speak, only a local pheno
menon confined to a thin shell of the sun's outer envelopes                    ;
and compounds formed would be rapidly decomposed both by
dissociation and chemical reduction             by
                                            being swept down into
the underlying hotter regions by the convection-currents which
take place on such an enormous scale in the sun's atmosphere.
The heat of the zone of combustion may also contribute to
the dissociation of compounds formed therein                  f.

in the solar spectrum, while the red line (w.-l. 6705) has not hitherto
been detected.      The question suggests itself whether the absence of this
last line may not also be connected with the existence of a region of com
bustion.    The low atomic weight of lithium would lead to the belief that
this element extends to great height in the solar atmosphere.

zone of combustion might be the source of lithium-radiation, and at the
temperature of the sun the blue line may be the longest (as appears pro
bable from the fact that this line requires    ahigh temperature for its de
velopment)     ;so that the vapour above the region of combustion may be
sufficient to reverse the blue, but insufficient to reverse the shorter" red
line.I    would here ask whether the bright red line so frequently seen in
the spectrum of the chromosphere by Lockyer (Phil. Trans. I860, pp.
 4:28 and 429), and described as bang less refrangible than        0,may not be
the missing lithium-liue?     I  may add that   a lino less refrangible than   O
has also been frequently seen by Kespi<jhi at the base of prominences.         It
is  highly significant that during the eclipse of 18l'8 blue line between

60        Mr. B. Meldola on a Cause for tlie Appearance
    It is well known to spectroscopists that the solar spectrum
is never absolutely free from the so-called " telluric
                                                                     " lines,
which have been shown to owe their existence to the aqueous
vapour of our atmosphere.               It is possible from the present
point of view that these lines may be partly caused by aqueous
vapour in the higher regions of the sun's atmosphere *. Should
there be any connexion between the activity of combustion
and the formation of sun-spots, Ti rigorous comparison of the
" telluric " lines in the solar spectrum carefully observed
                                                                          (or
still better, photographed) at different periods of the spot-
cycle would be of the highest possible interest. Thus it may
be suggested that the solar combustion varies periodically in
activity — combination being in excess of dissociation during
one half of the cycle, and dissociation being in the excess
during the other half, when the heat resulting from the com
bustion, having reached its maximum, tends to decompose the
compounds formed. This view points to the belief that the
connexion between the sun-spot period and the period of va
 riation of magnetic declination may be duo to a common
cause — the activity of combustion in the sun's atmosphere and
the resulting variation either in the amount of free oxygen, or
in the magnetic characters of this gas consequent on variation
of temperature.
     Sir William Thomson's theory of the dissipation of energy
leads to the belief that the sun, like other stars, is gradually
cooling down. Thus we should be led to infer a priori that
there must be a period in the life of a star when compounds
 can .begin to form.          Such combination would begin in the
 outer and cooler portions of the star's atmosphere, as required
by the present hypothesis, and would be attended with the
development of the heat representing the energy of chemical
 separation. As the star goes on cooling down, the zone of
 combustion, at first a mere shell, would gradually encroach
upon the central regions, and a star having permanently
bright lines in its spectrum would result. In the earlier
 stages of what may be called the
                                          " chemical period " of a star's
history — a period into which our sun may bo supposed to have
entered — the lines of the non-metallic elements would alone
 appear bright, for the reasons detailed in the foregoing por
 tions of this paper (paragraph 11), and, owing to their compa
rative faintness, would be lost at the enormous distances which
    *
      I may here recall the much-discussed observation of Secchi, who
asserted the existence of water-vapour        in the neighbourhood of sun-
spots (Compt. lietul. Ixviii. p. 2:t8). Janssen also, in 1864, observed aque
ous vapour in the atmosphere of Antares, and, in lg(58, in the atmosphere
of many other stars (Compt. Rend. Ixviii. p. 181-5).

the light of the star has to traverse before reaching our spec
troscopes. When, however, the region of combustion had
encroached sufficiently to reverse the metallic lines, these
would shine out with much greater brilliancy than the non-
metallic lines, and we should have a background of continuous
spectrum crossed by the bright lines of the metals of smallest
vapour-density.       Such stars would only be expected among
those which are, so to speak, in the latest phase of their " che
mical period."       It is significant that y Cassiopeiae, /3 Lyrae,
and ijArgo, three stars which show bright lines in their
spectra, all have sufficiently complex spectra to warrant the
belief that they have entered upon a late phase of their exist
ence.    Before the actual reversal of the metallic lines there
must exist a period in the life-history of many stars when the
temperature and extent of the zone of combustion is such as
to obliterate the dark lines of those metals which will ulti
mately appear as bright lines. Such appears to be the case
with the hydrogen in a. Orionis ; and according to the present
views it might perhaps be predicted that this star will sooner
or later show a permanent nydrogen-spectrum of bright lines.
 It is conceivable that in certain cases the composition of a
star's atmosphere may bo such as to permit a considerable
amount of cooling before any combination took place among
its constituents ; under such circumstances a sudden catas
trophe might mark the period of combination, and a star of
feeble light would blaze forth suddenly, as occurred in 1866
to T Coronae Borealis.       In other cases, again, it is possible
that the composition of a star's atmosphere may be of such a
nature as to lead to a shite of periodically unstable chemical
equilibrium ; that is to say, during a certain period combina
tion may be going on with the accompanying evolution of
heat, till at length dissociation again begins to take place.     In
this manner the phenomena of many variable stars may per
haps be accounted for.       On the whole, the possibility of actual
 combustion taking place in the atmosphere of a slowly cooling
 star previously at a temperature of dissociation doe's not seem
 to me to have had sufficient weight attached to it ; and in
 concluding,    I would point out the important factor which is
 thus introduced into calculations bearing upon the age of the
 sun's heat in relation to evolution.

             VII.     Notice of Researches in Tliermometry.
                By   EDMUND        J.  MILLS, D.Sc., F.R.S.*
IN since, which ofrequired
       the course             some researches, commenced some years
                                        a series of accurate measurements
with the mercurial thermometer,                  I had occasion to make a
somewhat minute inquiry into the properties of that instrument.
The publication of the completely reduced results has been de
layed by ill-health and pressure of other work ; my present
wish is to indicate them, as they may be of interest to those
who are engaged in observations of temperature.
   I.  If  an old thermometer be immersed in boiling water, its
zero descends.          In the course of two or three years, nt the
ordinary     heat   of   the air, the zero may attain its original posi
tion, subject     to  some     slight oscillations according to the season
of the year. If x represent the time in months, y the remain
ing depression, and (A + B) the total depression, the equation
to the ascent is
A« depending on            the diameter, B/9 on the length      of the bulb.
In  the case     of a spherical thermometer, A is very nearly equal
to B.     The probable error of a single comparison of theory
with experiment, in a fairly favourable instance, does not ex
ceed 0°-01 C.
   II. For other temperatures than that of boiling water, other
depressions occur ; the connexion between these depressions
and the temperature seems to follow a compound-interest law,
similar to the preceding.
   III.   If, however, a considerable elevation of temperature
be effected, then the zero no longer falls, but rises.            In various
lead-glass     thermometers         this  phenomenon usually     commences
at 120°-150°, the bulb collapsing to such an extent as to raise
the zero sometimes 8°.              At some point, which we may take
roughly     as  not   less   than   100° higher than the last, the zero is
again depressed,       —    as might, in fact, be expected from the then
sensible tension of mercury vapour, aqueous vapour, residual
air, and other foreign bodies in the tube.
          I
   IV. have made a largo number of comparisons of the
mercurial with the air-thermometer.                 The maximum difference
between the two, between 0° and 100°, is at about 33° ; neg
lecting Poggendorff's              important correction (as is usually
done), it lies at about 50°.              It is convenient to use a glass
helix,  instead      of   a  bulb,  for  the  body of the air-thermometer ;
in this way convection of air is avoided.

   V. The effect of external pressure on a thermometer's bulb
is directly proportional to the pressure as far as about 140
atmospheres.    The ascent of the zero of a thermometer on
keeping is consequent on a change of state in the glass, being
the same whether the thermometer bo open or closed, and
therefore independent of atmospheric pressure.
   VI. When all corrections are made, every individual ther
mometer has specific characters whereby it differs from all
other thermometers.
   VII. A number of bodies have been rigorously purified,
and their fusion-points determined, with a good second place
of decimals, in terms of the air-thermometer : these points
range from about 35° to 121°.    The possession of these bodies,
which can always be preserved without risk, will enable any
observer to obtain standard points within that distance, and
save a vast amount of tedious experimentation.

   To   the   Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
        GENTLEMEN,
      has long been known to practical men that, if an open
IT    pipe be stopped at one end, the note of the stopped pipe
is not exactly the octavo below the note of the open pipe, as it
should be according to Bernouilli's theory, but the stopped
pipe is somewhat less than an octave below the open pipe ; in
ordinary organ-pipes the difference is said to be about a major

   Now suppose a flat stopper, fitting airtight, to be applied at
one end   of the tube. It may then, according to the ordinary
theory, be regarded as equivalent to the half of an open pipe
whose middle point, or node, coincides with the face of the
stopper, the effective length measured from the node being
l + ». The length of the corresponding open pipe would be
double of this, or 2(1 + *). The ratio of the notes is conse
quently (/+2«) : 2(1 + «), which may bo put in the form
                             2"     l+ m

that is to say, the interval in question differs from an octave
by the interval whose ratio is (l+2«) : (l + «).
   The following experiment was made with an iron cylindrical
tube, 4-9 inches in length and 2 inches in diameter. The
notes were determined, as in my former investigations, by
blowing short jets of air against the edges. The tube was
stopped by standing it upright on a flat surface, and applying
a little oil round tho edge in contact with the surface.      Tho
notes of the pipe, open and stopped, made with one another
the interval of a minor seventh ; i. e. they deviated from tho
octave by a whole tone.         The ratio (9:8) was determined
with some slight accuracy by comparison with tho notes of
my enharmonic organ.         The tuning of this instrument is not,
however, sufficiently    stable   to base very accurate work on.

 The value of « for this tube was formerly determined at '635 R
 (Phil. Mag. vol. iv. p. 219). The tube has been shortened by
 about '1 inch since; but this cannot affect the correction.    It
 appears then that the present process presents general cor
 respondence with the result of the former investigation ; but
 the numerical values of « do not coincide very exactly.
            I
    When originally investigated this subject some time ago,
 I anticipated that  I should be able, by observation of the in

              the Notes of Open and Stopped Pipes.                  65
terval between open and stopped pipes, to determine « in an
accurate manner.                          I
                      For this purpose constructed many pipes,
in which the interval in question was as nearly as possible of
definite magnitude, generally a semitone less than the octave ;
but the method proved too inaccurate to be of any real use.
An excellent and perfect tonometer is required to measure tho
intervals accurately ; and if we have that, it can be applied to
the solution of the problem with greater advantage in other
ways. The present method, however, is quite sufficient for tho
approximate demonstration of the value of «.
   There are difficulties in the way of the exact application of
these principles to ordinary organ-pipes.         First, it is impos
sible to blow an open and stopped pipe in a similar manner
with the same mouthpiece. Tho pitch varies considerably
with the force of the blowing ; and the two notes produced
with different blowing are not comparable. Again, there is a
considerable correction of unknown amount to be taken ac
count of, due to the closing-in of the mouth-end of the pipe.
   We may, however, partly get over these difficulties.         In the
first place, it is possible to arrange a pipe so as to blow the
fundamental when open and the twelfth when stopped, without
variation of the wind.     Secondly, the correction due to tho
closing-in of the parts round the mouth can be determined for
pipes of given shape by sawing one of them across so as to
leave a plain circular end.       The correction due to the differ
ence  in pitch + (correction for circular end) gives the total
                  «
value of the correction for the mouth.
   The following is an example : — Organ-pipe 9-5 inches from
upper lip to open end ; diameter '95 inch. When arranged so
as to blow the fundamental when open and twelfth when
stopped, tho twelfth was 2 commas of the enharmonic organ
sharper than the note corresponding to tho fundamental.
Taking these to be true commas, which they are very nearly,
we may take the resulting interval to be 40 : 41.
   The correction for tho mouth was determined by sawing
across a similar pipe; it is roughly

briefly treated.  It well known that the general Surface Har

he treats of Ellipsoidal Harmonics,       name which he proposes to

   It well known that one of the standing difficulties of this sub
       is
ject resides in the proof of the theorem that
                                                  " any function which
does not become infinite between the limits of integration can be

satisfied with any one of them.          It may therefore be of some in
terest to give a sketch of the proof adopted by Mr. Ferrers. The
principal discussion takes place with reference to Zonal Harmonics,
though a proof of the general case is given on pp. 93-95. The
method, then, is as follows : — He first obtains an expression for the
potential of a spherical shell of uniform small thickness, whose
density is A for the part corresponding to the value of /^ from 1 to
X, and B for the part corresponding to the value of /i from X to — 1.
He then extends the same method to the case in which the densities
                    l
are A from /i = to /i=X,, B from Iu=X, to ^=X2, and C from
                — 1. His next step is to take X,=X and X2=X-J-e/X,
/^=Xi to ^=
and thus arrives at the result that
has the value unity from /i=X to fi=\ + d\, and zero for other
values of p. Now if we suppose X,, Aa, - . . to be continuous values
of X ranging from 1 to — ' 1, it is evident that the expression
will equal /(A,) when/*=A,, /(A2) when /J.=\ . . . ; and consequently
the whole expression must be/(/i).         But it is also plain that
and consequently       that f(p)  can   be expressed as a series      whose
general term ia

             " On the Chronological Value of the Triassic Strata of the
 South-western Counties."      By W. A. E. Ussher, Esq., F.G.S.
      The author maintained that the general thinning-out of the Trias
 in the South-Devon and West-Somerset area as it is traced north
 ward, of which he adduced evidence, proves that this area was not
 connected with that of Gloucestershire and the midland counties
 until the later stages of the Keuper ; and endeavoured to show by a
 comparison of sections that the area east of Taunton and south of
the ilendips was not submerged before the deposition of the Lower
 Keuper Sandstone, and probably not until the later stages of its
 formation, the Quantocks acting as a barrier dividing the Bridge-
 water area from the Watchet valley.       Jle thought that a subsidence
 progressing from south to north led to earlier deposition in South
 Devon, and to a consequent attenuation of the lower beds towards
 Watchet and Porlock.       Hence the lowermost beds of the Trias of
 the south coast arc much thicker than their more northerly equi
 valents, and probably were still thicker where the English Channel
 now flows, some bods perhaps dating as far back as Permian times.
 The presence of numerous fragments of igneous rocks (quartz-
 porphyries) in the basement-beds       of the South-Devon Trias, and
 the absence of known carrcsponding rocks in the county, led the
 author to infer that the cliffs and beds of the early Triassic sea were
 composed of such rocks, any undestroyed portions of which would
 probably occur either under the Triassic beds near Dartmoor and
between Newton and Seaton, or in the area now occupied by the

English Channel.        As continuity is evident only in the upper
division of the Trias, between the area of Devon and Somerset and
that of the midland counties, and there is no unconformity in the
former, the author maintained that the upper marls, upper sand
stones, and probably the conglomerate and pebble-bed subdivision
of Devon and Somerset, are equivalent in time to the Keupcr series
of the Midland counties, and that deposition took place in Devon
and Somerset between Keuper and Bunter times, bridging over the
hiatus marked by unconformity in the Midland counties.

    1.  " On  an Unconformable Break at the base of the Cambrian
Hocks near Llanberis." By George Maw, Esq., F.L.S., F.G.S.
    In a paper read before the Society on December 5, 1877 (Q. J. G.
 S. vol. xxxiv. p. 137), Prof. Hughes referred to an observation
 made by the author in 1867 as to the occurrence near Llanberis of
 an unconformable break, indicating the base of the Cambrian, and,
 while accepting the asserted existence of pre-Cambrian rocks in
 North Wales, placed the base of the Cambrian in a very different
 position, and maintained that the appearances              described by
 Mr. Maw might be accounted for by lateral pressure acting upon
 beds of dissimilar texture and unequal hardness.        The author had
 reexamined the section in question, and maintained his original
 interpretation    of the phenomena, which ho regarded as the
 earliest indication of the existence of a pre-Cambrian series. He
 accounted for differences observed in the supposed pre-Cambrian
 rocks at Moel Tryfaen and Llanberis by regarding them as having
 undergone different degrees of metamorphism.
    2.  " On  the so-called Greenstones of Central and Eastern      Corn
 wall." By J. Arthur Phillips, Esq., F.G.S.
    In this paper the author extended his investigations of the rocks
 formerly mapped as greenstones, from the western (see Q. J. G. S.
 vol. xxxii. p. 155) into the central and eastern districts of Cornwall.
 He described in detail various rocks from different parts of these
 districts, the examination of which had led him to the following
 conclusions.    The numerous lavas which occur here, in addition to
 the rocks met with in Western Cornwall, arc so interbedded with
 the slates and schists as to lead to the csnviction that they are con

 70                        Geological Society: —
 temporancous ; and, although much altered, they closely resemble
lavas of more modern date.         Sometimes they assume a distinctly
 schistose character.     The crystalline greenstones are more varied
 and instructive than those of the western portion of the county ;
 some of them arc typical dolerites, while others are so altered as to
 consist only of a granular indefinite base, traversed by indistinct
 microlitic bodies.      Their pyroxenic constituent is augitc ; and
 although many would call them diabases or melaphyres, the author
 regards it as more logical to regard them as ancient dolerites.
 AVhere these rocks are altered the augito is usually changed into
 hornblende and viridite, while the felspar becomes cloudy, and
 finally merges into a granular base.       The crystals of augite are
 often gradually replaced by an assemblage of felted microlites ; in
 other cases their outlines are preserved whilst their substance is
replaced by hornblende, the rock being thus converted into a uralitt-
doUrite or uraJite-diabase.     AVhen these rocks do not contain augite,
and are to a great extent composed of long bacillary hornblendic
 crystals made up of parallel bclonitcs, the ends of which are fre
 quently curved outwards, it is probable that hornblende was an
 original constituent of the rock, which is therefore a true diorite.
 Slaty or schistose greenstones are less frequent than in the western
 districts ; but on St. -deer Down the " hornblende-slates

to the age of the rocks described, the author states that they are

slaty hornblendic bands arc evidently contemporaneous with the
slates among which they arc bedded, while the latter are often dis
placed by the granite or traversed by granitic veins ; and, further,
the eruptive dolcritic rocks which break through the sedimentary
beds never traverse the granite, but arc often interrupted by it.

Winchell, Esq.      Communicated by J. Geikie, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.
    The author's purpose in this paper was to arrive at an estimate of
the date of the last glacial period from the rate of recession of the
Falls of St. Anthony, near the junction of the Minnesota and Mis
sissippi rivers.   He stated that the country is covered with deposits
of glacial origin, that between the present falls and Fort Sncl-
ling, a distance of eight miles, the existing river-gorge has been
formed since the deposition of the newer Boulder-clay, and that the
old river-valley is filled up with glacial deposits. The gorge is of
very uniform character, being cut through hard limestones resting
on soft sand rock, both lying quite horizontally.     The country was
settled in 1S30 ; and the recession of the falls has since been very

          On  tlta Geological Results of the Polar Expedition.        71
rapid, its rate having been accelerated by the erection of saw-mills,
dams, &c.       From the accounts of various travellers who have visited
the falls in the last 200 years, the author endeavoured to obtain an
estimate of the true rate of recession. Between the visit of Father
Hennepin in 1688 and that of Carver in 1766 he finds a recession at
the rate of 3'49 feet annually, between Carver's visit and 1856 a mean
annual recession of 6-73 feet, and between Hennepin and 1856 one
of 5-15 feet. The time-estimates for the cutting of the gorge would
be, according to the above means, 12, 103, 6, 276 and 8202 years.
The author considers the data upon which the second of these
numbers is founded the most reliable.

Admiral Sir George Nares, F.R.S." By Capt. H. -W. Fcilden, R.A.,
F.G.S., and C. E. Do Ranee, Esq., F.G.S.
    The authors describe the Laurentian gneiss that occupies so large
 a tract in Canada as extending into the Polar area, and alike
 underlying the older Palaeozoic rocks of the Parry Archipelago, tho
 Cretaceous and Tertiary plant-bearing beds of Disco Island, and the
 Oolites and Lias of East Greenland and Spitzbergen.        Newer than
 the Laurentian, but older than the fossiliferous rocks of Upper
 Silurian age, are the Cape-Rawson beds, forming the coast-lino
 between Scoresby Bay and Cape Cresswell, in lat. 82° 40' ; these
 strata are unfossiliferous slates and grit, dipping at very high
 angles.
     From the fact that Sir John Richardson found these ancient rocks
 in the Hudson's-Bay territory to be directly overlain by limestones,
 containing corals of the Upper Silurian Niagara and Onondaga
 group, Sir Roderick Murchison inferred that the Polar area was dry
 land during the whole of the interval of time occupied by the
 deposition of strata elsewhere between tho Laurentian and the
  Upper Silurian ; and the examination by Mr. Saltcr, Dr. Haughton,
 and others of the specimens brought from the Parry Islands have
 hitherto been considered to support this view.        The specimens of
 rocks and fossils, more than 2000 in number, brought by the late
 expedition from Grinncll and Hall Lands have made known
 to us, with absolute certainty, the occurrence of Lower-Silurian
  species in rocks underlying the Upper Silurian ; and as several
 of these Lower-Silurian forms have been noted from tho Arctic
  Archipelago, there can be little doubt that the Lower Silu
  rians are there present also.   The extensive areas of dolomite of a
  creamy colour discovered by M'Clintock around the magnetic pole,
  on the western side of Boothia, in King William's Island, and in
  Princc-of- Wales Land, abounding in fossils, described by Dr.
  Haughton, probably represent the whole of the Silurian era and
  possibly a portion of the Devonian.
      The bases of the Silurians are seen in North Somerset, and

72                         Geological   Society.
consist of finely stratified red sandstone and slate, resting directly
on the Laurentian gneiss, resembling that found at Cape Bunny and
in the cliffs between Whale and Wolstenholme Sounds. Above these
sandstones occur ferruginous limestones, with quartz grains ; and
still higher in the series the cream-coloured limestones come in.
The Silurians occupy Prince-Albert Land, the central and -western
portion of North Devon, and the whole of Cornwallis Island. The
Carboniferous Limestone -was discovered, rising to a height of 2000
 feet, on the extreme north coast of Grinnell Land, in Feildcn and
 Parry Peninsulas, and contains many species of fossils in common
 with the rocks of the same age in Spitzbergen and the Parry
 Archipelago, being probably continuously connected with the lime
 stone of that area, by way of the United-States range of mountains.
 The coal-bearing beds that underlie the Carboniferous Limestones of
 Melville Island are absent in Grinnell Land ; but they are represented
by true marine Devonians, established in the Polar area for the first
 time, through the determination of the fossils, by Mr. Etheridge.
 In America a vast area is covered by Cretaceous rocks. The lowest
 division, the Dakota group, contains lignite seams and numerous
plant-remains indicating a temperate flora ; overlying the Cretaceous
series are various Tertiary beds, each characterized by a special flora,
 the oldest containing subtropical and tropical forms, such as various
 palms of Eocene type.      In the overlying Miocene beds the character
 of the plants indicates a more temperate climate ; and many of the
 species occur in the Miocene beds of Disco Island, in West Green
land, and a few of them in beds associated with the 30-feet coal-
 seam discovered at Lady-Franklin Sound by the late expedition.
The warmer Eocene flora is entirely absent in the Arctic area ; but
the Dakota beds are represented by the " Atane strata " of West
 Greenland, in which the leaves of dicotyledonous plants first appear.
 Beneath  it,   in Greenland,  is  an older series of Cretaceous plant-
bearing beds, indicating   a     somewhat warmer climate, resembling
that experienced in Egypt and the Canary Islands at the present
time.     In the later Miocene beds of Greenland, Spitzbergen, and
the newly discovered beds of Lady-Franklin Sound, the plants belong
to climatal conditions 30° warmer than at present, the most northern
localities marking the coldest conditions.       The common fir (Pinus
abies)  was  discovered  in  the  Grinnell-Land  Miocene, as well as the
birch, poplar, and other trees, which doubtless extended across the
polar area to Spitzbergen, where they also occur.
    At the present time the coasts of Grinnell Land and Greenland are
steadily rising from the sea, beds of glacio-marine origin, with shells of
the same species as are now living in Kennedy Channel, extending
up the hillsides and valley-slopes to a height of 1000 ft., and
reaching a    thickness of from 200 to 300 ft. These deposits, which
have much in common with the " boulder- clays " of English geo
logists, are formed by the deposition of mud and sand carried down
by summer torrents and discharged into fiords and arms of the sea,
covered with stone- and gravel-laden floes, which, melted bv the
heated and turbid waters, precipitate their freight on the- mud

above     the sea. The coast is fringed with the ice-foot, forming a
flat terrace 50 to 100 yards in breadth, stretching from the base of
the cliffs to the sea-margin.          This wall of ice is not made up of
frozen sea-water, but of the accumulated autumn snowfall, which,
drifting to the beach, is converted into ico where it meets the sea-
water which splashes over it.

           AMMONIO-ARGENTIC          IODIDE.     BY M. CAREY LEA.
"V\7    HEN    silver iodide is exposed to ammonia-gas it absorbs 3'6 per
           cent., and forms, according to Rammelsberg, a compound in
 which an atom of ammonia is united to two of Agl. Liquid ammonia
 instantly whitens Agl; every trace of the strong lemon-yellow
 colour disappears.        The behaviour of the ammonia iodide under
 the influence of light differs singularly from that of the plain
 iodide, and will be here described.
     The affinity of Agl for ammonia is very slight.           If the white
 compound bo thrown upon a filter and washed with water, tho
 ammonia washes quickly out, the yellow colour reappearing.                If
  simply exposed to the air, the yellow colour returns while the
 powder is yet moist ; so that the ammonia is held back with less
 energy than the water.          So long, however, as the ammonia is pre
  sent, the properties of the iodide are entirely altered.
     Agl precipitated with excess of       KI  does not darken by exposure
 to light even continued for months.           But the same iodide exposed
  under liquid ammonia rapidly darkens to an intense violet-black,
  precisely similar to that of A'gCl exposed to light, and not at all
  resembling the greenish-black of Agl exposed in presence of excess
  of silver nitrate.      (This difference no doubt depends upon the
  yellow of the unchanged Agl mixing with the bluish-black of the
  changed, whereas in the case of the ammonia iodide the yellow
  colour has been first destroyed.)
     When the exposure is continued for some time, the intense
  violet-black colour gradually lightens again, and finally quite dis
  appears ; the iodide recovers its original yellow colour, with perhaps
  a little more of a greyish shade.       This is a new reaction, and differs
  entirely from any thing       that  has been hitherto observed.     It has
  lwn long known that darkened Agl washed over with solution of
   K I and exposed to light, bleached.          This last reaction is intelli
  gible enough ; for     KI  in solution exposed to light decomposes, and
  in presence of Agl darkened by light gives up iodine to the Agl,
   and so bleaches it.     The above experiment is quite different.      The
   darkened substance may be washed well with water (during which

 74               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articlef.
operation it passes from violet-black to dark brown), and may then
be exposed to light either under liquid ammonia or under pure
 water : in either case the bleaching takes place, though in the latter
cas? more slowly.
    If the experiment be performed in a test-tube, the bleaching
 under ammonia requires several hours, under water from one to
three days.          But if the iodide be formed upon paper, and this
paper     be    exposed      to light, washing it constantly with liquid
ammonia, the darkening followed by the bleaching requires little
more than a minute.             In this case, however, the bleaching is not
 so complete, perhaps because of the influence of the organic matter
present.        The bleaching appears to depend upon the escape of
ammonia ; for if the darkened ammonia iodide is covered with slrong
liquid ammonia and the test-tube well corked, the bleaching does
not take place.
    It became a matter of interest to know whether the darkening
 under ammonia was accompanied by any decomposition — whether
the ammonia took up iodine from the silver salt under the action
 of light.      For this purpose Agl was precipitated with excess of
 KI, and subjected to a long and thorough washing; it was then
exposed for several days to light under strong liquid ammonia.
As Agl is not wholly insoluble in ammonia, the mother- water was
first evaporated to dryness at a heat but little over ordinary tem
peratures.        The traces of residue were washed with water; and
this water gave distinct indications of iodine. The iodine present
is in so small a quantity that it may easily be overlooked : but it is
certainly there.         The washing given to the Agl was so thorough
that it seemed impossible to admit that traces of            KI remained at
tached to the Agl ; but in order to leave no room for doubt, the
experiment was repeated, using an excess of silver nitrate in
making the precipitation, followed by thorough washing.                Iodine
was still found in combination with ammonia ; and under these
conditions there could be no doubt that Agl had been decom
posed.
   When Agl is blackened under ammonia in a test-tube, and the
uncorked test-tube is set aside in the dark for a day or two, the
Agl assumes a singular pinkish shade.               It thus appears that Agl
under the influence of ammonia and of light gives indications of
most of the colours of the spectrum.                 Starting with white, it
passes    under    the  influence   of light to violet, and thence nearly to
black  :   this   violet-black    substance   washed    with water passes to
brown.       The brown substance covered with ammonia and left to
itself in an open test-tube becomes pinkish in the dark, yellow in
sunlight.        These curious relations to colour which we see in the
silver   haloids,   from time to time exhibiting themselves in new ways,
seem to give hope of the eventual discovery of some complete
method of heliochromy. — Sillimau's American Journal, May 1878.

           ON   THE PRODUCTION OF PLATEAU'S FILM-SYSTEMS.
                           BY A. TERQUEM.
  M. Plateau, by the    use of a mixture of soap-water and glycerine,
has produced liquid films of a certain extent, and has thus been
able to verify most of the laws respecting the form of the surfaces
which constitute the boundaries of liquids whose molecules are
subjected only to their reciprocal actions.
   1 pointed out, some years since, that for the glyceric liquid a
mixture of soap-water and sugar might be substituted, the latter
substance having, especially, like glycerine, the effect of augmenting
the viscosity of the liquid, and preventing it from flowing away too
rapidly. The production of the film-systems of M. Plateau de
mands the employment of a great quantity of liquid if polyhedra be
used the edges of which are of large dimensions.
  I  have thought that large films of liquid might be easily obtained
by bounding them in part by flexible threads instead of using for
the purpose rigid wires only.
   Thus, if two horizontal rods be joined by two vertical and equi
distant flexible threads, on dipping the system in the saponaceous
liquid and slowly lifting it out again, we get a vertical plane film
bounded above and below by Ihe two rods, and laterally by the
flexible threads, which take the form of arcs of a circle.   The radius
of the circle evidently depends on the stretching weight. It is
easily demonstrated that, if we designate by 1 the distance between
the two threads, by B. the radius of the arc constituted by them,
by <f the angle made with the vertical by the tangent of the arc at
the point of attachment of the thread to the lower rod, by/the
superficial tension of each of the two surfaces of the liquid film,
and by p the stretching weight, we have the relation
   Every thing happens, therefore, as if the distance between the
threads were equal to that between the centres of the two arcs, the
tension of the threads being omitted.
  I   of course submitted this formula to a series of experimental
verifications, by measuring with the cathetometer the diminution of
the vertical distance between the two horizontal rods produced by
the existence of a liquid-film between them.
  If   H is the initial length of the threads, and II' the new vertical
distance of the horaontal rods, to find the radius of the circle and
the angle       <J>
              we have only to solve the two equations
                             H' = 2Rsin^ and   2
whence we derive
   As the angle    generally very small, this transcendental equa

    Proceeding tbus,      I  have obtained, as the mean of a number of
determinations, the number 2-79 milligrams for the value of/.               On
the contrary, measuring the superficial tension by employing the
drop-counter,      I obtained the value 3'47 milligr., considerably higher
than the preceding.          This difference, which surprised me at first,
too great     to be  attributed    to errors of experiment, would need to
be    controlled    by  other    similar   determinations made upon other
liquids,   of  which   there   are  but  few  capable of forming films of large
extent.     It   may  have    been  due,   according to M. Duclaux (to whom
I  submitted the difficulty), to the circumstance that in a very thin
film like that of soap-solution, the superficial tension has a lower
value than in the free surface of the same liquid in indefinite mass
—which would indicate that the thickness of the liquid layer in
which the molecules have the abnormal arrangement which produces
superficial tension exceeds half the thickness of the soap-film.
    Thanks to the same arrangement,              I have been able to execute
 other experiments suitable for showing the superficial tension of
liquids. Moreover, on replacing, in Plateau's polyhedra (such as the
tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron, &c.), a certain number of
rigid rods by flexible threads, we can produce with great facility,
 and with a minimum quantity of liquid, laminar systems of consi
 derable dimensions and a certain number of surfaces possessing the
 characteristic property that their mean curvature is nil. — Complex

  ON THE MAGNETIC           ROTATION OF THE PLANE OF POLARIZATION
     OF LIGHT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE EARTH. BY HENRI
     BECQUEREL.
    In the course of my investigations on magnetic rotatory polari
 zation,  I have been led to the direct estimation of the action of ter
 restrial magnetism upon various substances. This action can be
 very neatly made evident by an experiment which seemed to me
 sufficiently interesting to be communicated to the Academy.
    Between a Jellet polarizer and an analyzer furnished with a tele
 scope and mounted on a divided circle is placed a tube of half a
 metre length, terminated by parallel glass plates and containing
 bisulphide of carbon. At the two ends of the tube, plane mirrors
 arranged as Faraday arranged them gave several successive reflec
 tions of the luminous ray, and thus augmented the observed rota
 tion.    In the present experiment the second reflection could bo
 viewed ; the ray had therefore traversed the tube five times, corre
 sponding to a thickness of 2'5 metres of bisulphide of carbon. Tho
 source of light was a pipe with oxyhydrogen gas.              A great amount
 of light was lost by absorption and by the successive reflections;
 and the rays transmitted to the eye were chiefly the yellow rays.
 The entire system was firmly fixed to a horizontal copper rule, and

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                        77
could turn about a vertical axis so as to orient the luminous beam
in various directions.
    With this arrangement it is ascertained that, if the system be
made to coincide in direction with the plane of the magnetic meri
dian, the same position of the polarization-plane is not obtained
whether we look towards the south or towards the north ; a great
number of closely concordant measurements gave an angular differ
ence of about 6'-5 between the two positions.                  On the contrary,
if we place ourselves in a position perpendicular to the magnetic
meridian, we get the same direction of the plane of polarization
whether we look towards the east or towards the west ; and this
position is the bisectrix of that which we have in viewing towards
magnetic north and south.
     It may hence be concluded that the angular difference observed
is a rotation of the plane of polarization of the light, due to the
action of the earth ; the number 6'-5 measures the double of the
rotation for yellow light and in the special conditions of the experi
 ment.       The direction of this rotation is the same as that of the
 rotation of the earth ; it is the direction of an electric current
 which, on the hypothesis of Ampere, would give rise to the pheno
 mena of terrestrial magnetism.
     It must bo remarked that the number we have given only refers
 to observations made in the laboratory of the Museum d'llistoire
 naturelle, in proximity to more or less considerables masses of iron.
 To ascertain with more precision the action of the globe, and to
 utilize this method for estimating the intensity of the earth's mag
 netism, it would be necessary to use the same precautions as for
 ordinary observations of terrestrial magnetism, and to amplify the
 phenomenon by taking a longer tube. This is what                 I  am at present
 engaged      in.
     The system arranged as above indicated exhibits remarkable sen
  sitiveness to the action of magnetism : an ordinary bar magnet,
  held in the hand, and brought parallel near to the tube, first in one
  direction, then in the other, is sufficient to make manifest a rotation
  of the plane of polarization that may attain to upwards of 1°.
      It is interesting to compare this direct measurement with an esti
  mation, made by Mr. Gordon*, of the magnetic rotation produced
  by 1 centim. of bisulphide of carbon under a magnetic action equal to
  unity. The result found by calculating from this number the action
  of the terrestrial horizontal component is, that 2'5 metres of bisul
  phide of carbon should give, with yellow light, a single rotation of
  3'-8 — instead of 3'-25, which results from our direct observation.
  The difference may be due to exterior perturbations.                  If we adopt
  the   latter  number,    we  see    that,  under   the  conditions    in which wo
  have placed     ourselves,    the  double   rotation   of 1  metre   of  bisulphide
  of carbon      would  be  2'-6,  and  that  of 1 metre  of  water  0'-8. —  Comptes

      ON THE   CRYSTALLIZATION OF SILICA IN THE DRY WAY.
                         BY P. HAUTEFEUILLE.
   In 1868 M. vom Rath described, in a trachyte, some small lamelli-
form crystals, of which he made a iiew species, tridymite.         The
observations of that accomplished mineralogist prove that tridymite
is silica crystallized under a form different from that of quartz, and
possessing a lower density than that species.         Like sulphur, arse-
uious acid, flowers of antimony, &c., silica crystallizes under two
incompatible forms.                                        I
                        It can be prepared, as shall prove, in the
dry way, under both these forms.
    The only known process for crystallizing silica in the dry way we
owe to M. G. Hose ; it is based on the employment of the phos
phorus-salt, and permits only tridymite to be prepared.         The alka
line tungstates can, with advantage, be substituted for the phos
phates ; for they permit crystallized silica to be obtained, at pleasure,
either under the form of tridymite or under that of quartz.
    Reproduction of Tridymite. — Amorphous silica, kept at the molt
ing temperature of silver in tungstate of sodium, crystallizes in a
few hours.     After the cooling, treatment with water dissolves the
alkaline tungstate and lays bare a crystalline sand, the weight of
which   is,within few thousandths, that of the silica employed.
                        a
    The principal crystallographic and optical characters of tridymite
are easily verified in the crystals obtained by this process.       They
are thin hexagonal scales, mostly piled one upon another to the
number of three or four*. Upon the most regular scales one or two
half-scales are frequently lodged.
    By the long-continued action of tungstate of sodium at a nearly
constant temperature of 1000° C., the tridymite can be obtained in
thick scales.    These crystals, mixed with large lamella) grouped
according   to one of the two laws alluded to, are hexagonal tables
with faces free from stricet.

there is formed at the expense of the lamelliform crystals a silicate
disseminated in droplets in the fused salt. This destruction of the
tridymite is only temporary, if the silicate bo maintained in the
liquid bath formed by the acid tungstate, at a temperature between
900° and 1000° ; for this silicate then undergoes a decomposition
which regenerates the tridymite.         This sort of precipitation in the
dry way demands much more time than the crystallization of amor
phous silica. This is why it is more advantageous to heat silica
with tungstate of sodium than to decompose an alkaline silicate by
tungstie acid.
     The destruction of tridymite, and subsequent precipitation of
silica in the form of lamella), permit the part played by the tungstate
of sodium in the act of crystallization to be analyzed. The alkali
 of the tungstate attacks the silica, producing an alkaline silicate ;
and the tungstie acid retakes at a lower temperature the alkali
 which the silica had taken from it. These two reciprocally inverse
 actions take place successively when the temperature oscillates be
 tween certain limits.      They suffice to explain the crystallization,
 without it being necessary to invoke the solubility of silica in the
 fused salt; for these reactions are perfectly comparable with those
 which determine the crystallization of the sesquioxide of iron when
 it is heated in gaseous hydrochloric acid.
      Although   I cannot at present compare the results furnished by
 the method     I  have just made known with those which can be ob
 tained by a judicious application of M. GK Rose's method,          I  will
 notice this fact, that the preparation of tridymite by means of tung
 state of sodium does not require a temperature so elevated as that
 which is necessary when acid phosphate of sodium is employed.
 The phosphoric salt and the tungstate of sodium are both minerali-
  zers of silica ; but the latter salt exerts a more energetic action than
 the former, even at a less-elevated temperature — which permits it
  to be employed for reproducing the numerous more or less fusible
  silicates which are associated with silica in the rocks. — Comptes

              OUTLINES    OF THE ACTINIC THEORY OF HEAT.
                            BY PROF. C. PUSCHL.
     In  the present form of the mechanical theory of heat, and spe
 cially in the kinetic theory of gases, the sum of the vires viva of
 the ponderable atoms of a body in motion among themselves is re
 garded as the quantity of heat of the body ; while the sum of the
 vires viva of the ffither contained in the body is neglected, and it is
 assumed that this medium exerts no sensible influence on the
 motions of the atpma.        This presentation the author holds to be
 inadequate.       It is remarked that a hot body may be cooled not
 merely by contact with colder bodies, but also by radiation, and
 that the velocity of such a cooling is not always inconsiderable, but
  under favourable circumstances is so great that many physicists

80            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
occasionally note it as astonishing.       It is evident that the atoms
of a heated body give up vis viva to the (other : in other words. the
aether takes from the moving atoms of the body a part of their
velocity; it therefore, indeed, exerts upon them an influence which
acts as a resistance checking their velocity, and is by no means in
considerable, but of relatively great intensity.       Conversely, a body
can receive heat not merely by contact with warmer bodies, but
also by radiation from without.       Its atoms then take vis viva from
the aether ; that is, the aether imparts to the atoms an increase of
velocity.    Consequently, in a body cooled by radiation outwards,
the motions of its atoms are rendered slower by the aether ; in one
growing warmer through radiation from without the motions of its
atoms are accelerated ; in a body which under equal radiation out
wards and inwards maintains a constant temperature the forces of
the aether retarding and accelerating the motions of its atoms must
on the whole maintain equilibrium ; and in consequence of the
rapid change of atom-motion into radiant heat, and of radiant-heat
into atom-motion, these forces must, for every temperature that
occurs, possess great intensity.     The kinetic theory, which takes no
account of such forces, is, according to the author, incapable of
anyhow rendering intelligible a rapid annihilation or generation of
atomic velocities by mere generation or annihilation of aether-undu
lations, whereas to him the actinic theory, touched upon in the
present memoir, appears to correspond perfectly with the above
conclusion.    According to it an essential portion of the heat of a
body consists of radiating heat, which is accumulated by diffusion
between the atoms, and, from the extreme minuteness of the mean
radiation-distance, is concentrated to an enormous intensity.          The
aether, thus put into most vehement vibration, exerts at the same
time, upon the atoms floating in it, .through the relative differences
of radiation   (i.e. through the difference of its elasticity-forces     on
the average existing on opposite sides of the opaque atoms irradi
ating one another, and changing with their positions), proportion
ally intense motive forces,        by
                                   which they are alternately retarded
and accelerated according to their momentary positions        ;and conse
quently their vires vivce are to corresponding amount expended on
                                    a
the production of aether-undulations, by the consumption of which
they are again replaced.
   According to Pouillet's determination of the intensity of the
solar radiation, it    calculated that the mean square of the velocity
                      is
of the aether for direct sunlight      to that of the aether in water at
                                        is
0° C. approximately as         273,000,000,000,000

                               :                      ;   and accordingly
it appears  to the  author  possible that   the  atoms of a  body recipro
cally exert very intense accelerative forces (according to the hypo
thesis, in the sense of attractions)             by
                                               the heat-rays which they
emit to one another        while the corresponding force which any
                           ;
available source of heat exerts upon       body irradiated

          fraction 5J^j, which, in round numbers, is taken to
THEexpress       the ellipticity of the earth, has apparently a ten
dency,  as  far as  it is deduced from the measurement of terres
trial arcs, to increase as the data of the problem are added to.
The 2 ^5, obtained by Airy and Bessel from the very imperfect
data of forty years back, was replaced, on the completion of
the Russian and English arcs in 1858, by ^r ; and the geo
detic work recently completed in India indicates a further
increase of the fraction, and so an assimilation to that obtained
from pendulum observations. The data of the Indian arc of
21°, as used in 1858, were vitiated by a serious uncertainty as
to the unit of length used by Colonel Lambton in the mea
surement of the southern half of that arc.          It appears from
the Annual Reports of Colonel Walker, C.B., F.R.S., Surveyor-
General of India, who has been for many years Superintendent
of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (reports which
are replete with scientific interest), that this southern portion
of " the Great Arc," as Colonel Everest delighted to call              it,
has been completely remeasured and the latitudes of            great
                                                                   a
number of stations in       it determined. A complete meridian
chain of triangles has also been carried from Mangalore on the
west coast, in latitude 12° 52' and longitude 75° E., to a point
in latitude 32°.       As this triangulation      rigidly connected
                                                     is
with the arc from Cape Comorin to Kaliana, in 78° E. longi
tude, it   may be considered that the Indian Arc         now 24° in

    Colonel Walker's last Report contains the details of eleven
determinations of difference of longitude by electro-telegraphy,
with the corresponding geodetic differences. The differences
of longitude are between Mangalore and Bombay on the west
coast, v izagapatam and Madras on the east coast, and Hydra-
bad, Bangalore, and Bellary in the interior. Bellary holds a
somewhat central position in the polygon formed by the other
points ; Mangalore and Madras are very nearly in the same
latitude ; and Bangalore is midway between them. These dif
ferences of longitude have been determined with every refine
ment of modern science, and, taking into account the uncer
tainty of local attraction, may be considered little, if at all,
inferior to latitude-determinations.              " When the operations
were commenced," says Colonel Walker, " determined that I
they should be carried on with great caution and in such a
manner as to be self-verificatory, in order that some more satis
factory estimate might be formed of the magnitudes of the
errors to which they are liable than would be afforded by the
theoretical probable errors of the observations                       The
simplest arrangement appeared to be to select three trigono
metrical stations A, B, C, at nearly equal distances apart on a
telegraphic line forming a circuit, and, after having measured
the longitudinal arcs corresponding to A B and B C, to mea
sure AC independently as a check on the other two arcs."
    The eleven determinations of difference of longitude between
the seven points named above give thus five equations of con
dition among themselves, which enable us to assign a system
of minimum corrections to the several determinations. The
following Table contains the observed differences, together
with the computed corrections, half-weight being given to the
first two determinations, which were the earliest made, and
which are affected with some slight defects, then undiscovered,

   Besides the data contained in his last annual report, Colonel
Walker has kindly given me provisional results for his great
arcs (or arc, for we may consider them as one) — not final
results, but yet not likely to be materially altered.  The Indian
Triangulation contains vast number of astronomical stations

very much more numerous than in the others.           The Russian

    It   is interesting to consider the influence of each of the
three great arcs m determining the semiaxes of the earth.
The northern ten degrees from 60° to 70° of the Russian arc
determine -|a — Jc ; the ten degrees in England from 50° to
60° determine a ; the ten degrees in France from 40° to 50°
determine £ a + £ c ; the ten degrees in India from 10° to 20°
determine — i^a + fjc.            Or, more precisely, taking the arcs
in combination, suppose each arc to have six astronomical sta
tions, equidistant, 5 apart in the Russian and 4° apart in the
two other arcs ; and let these arcs be combined by the method
of least squares to determine the mean figure of the earth.
Let 0i . . . 0g be the latitudes of the stations in the Russian arc,
numbered from north to south ; 0! . . . 06 those of the Anglo-
French ; ^TI . . . ^r6 those of the Indian ; then, supposing these
expressed in seconds, a involves, in feet,

     From which we         see at a  glance the effect that would result
 from an alteration of any one of the latitudes.
     It seems unnecessary to give here the expressions for the
 corrections to the stations of the English, the Russian, Cape-
 of-Good-Hope, and Peruvian arcs, which are to be found in
 a paper on the Figure of the Earth, in the Memoirs of the
 Royal Astronomical Society for 1860, pp. 34, 35. It is only
 necessary to remark that the sign of u m those expressions is
 to be changed, and that            I  have now added three points to
 the Anglo-French arc as there used.               Making now the sum

  forty-nine latitude stations and die seven longitude stations

        .-. u= -0-2899     ;   v= + 0-2428.
From these wo have, in feet of the standard yard,
                          a =20926202,

And this is the spheroid most nearly representing the mean
figure of the earth.
   But the Indian observations are not well represented by this
figure.     The southern station of the arc requires a large ne
gative   correction  of — 3"-14, and the northern station a still
larger negative correction of — 3"-55.        Among the longitude
stations, there is left at Bombay a westerly deflection of
4"-05, and at Madras an easterly deflection of 4"-50.             The
longitudes,    in  fact, require  a larger  value  of  a and a larger
value of the cllipticity : while the form of the meridian-arc
requires a smaller equatorial radius and a smaller ellipticity.
In other words, so far as the observations we have at present
to consider indicate, the surface of India does not seem to be
long to a spheroid of revolution : if it does, we must admit
large deflections towards the sea at Cape Comorin, at Bombay,
and at Madras.       :
   But we may obtain more strictly the form of the Indian arc
from the sixty-six latitude stations it contains. Not to confine
the arc to an elliptic form, let it be such that its radius of cur
vature in latitude 0 is expressed by the equation
                  p= A' + 2B'cos 20 + 2C' cos    4<f>,
a curve which includes the ellipse as a particular case. In
order to determine A, B, C, we must apply symbolical correc
tions to the observed latitudes, and make the sum of the
squares of these corrections a minimum.          As the result of a
very long calculation, the actual equation is found to be
   p= 20932184-1 -167963-6 cos 2^ + 28153-2 cos 40. . (E')
The correction to the latitude of the southern point is + 1"-61,
and to the northern — 0"-81 ; and, generally, the residual cor
rections or apparent local attractions are free from any appear
ance of law, so that the above equation may be taken as very
closely representing the form of the sea-level along the meri
dian of India. The geodetic operations give us the/orm of the

curve in the shape of its intrinsic equation ; and the absolute
direction of the curve with reference to the polar axis is given
by observing that, at its southern extremity, the actual direc
tion of the surface of the sea makes an angle of 1"-61 with the
curved Now, the observed latitude of the southern point being
8° 12' 10"-44, the direction of the normal to our curve f E')
at the same point makes the angle 8° 12' 12"-05 with the plane
of the equator, which determines the curve as to its absolute
direction.   So also, on referring the Indian meridian to the
ellipse (E), determined above as representing the mean figure
of the earth, this ellipse at the southern point of the Indian arc
has its normal inclined to the equator at an angle equal to
observed latitude — 3"-14, or 8° 12' 7"-30. We can now trace
the difference of the forms of the curves (E, E') by making
them coincide at the southern point of the arc.       The selection
for this purpose  of  the southern point   is quite arbitrary ; any
other station would have done equally well.           Multiply the
expression for p, the radius of curvature, by — sin d^> and                  <f>
then by cos d<f>, and integrate
                0                      thus we get the following

  Here we see the local form of the meridian sea-level in
India with reference to the mean figure of the earth. Sup
posing that there is no disturbance of the sea-level at Cape
 Comorin, then from that point northwards a depression sets in,
 attaining a maximum of nearly 20 feet at about 14° latitude ;
 thence it diminishes, disappearing at about 21°. An elevation
then commences, attaining at 26 about nine feet ; then this
 elevation diminishes, and becomes a small depression at 32°.
This deformation may or may not be due to Himalayan attrac
tion ; at any rate we have here an indication that that vast
tableland does not produce the disturbance that might a priori
have been anticipated.       This is in accordance with the fact
that there is an attraction seaward at Hangalore and Madras,
and slightly also at Bombay : and think we have here a cor-I
roboration of Archdeacon Pratt's theory, that where the crust
 of the earth is thickest there it is least dense ; and where thin
nest, as in ocean-beds, there it is most dense.
    The Anglo-French arc shows a deformation nearly as great
as the Indian — though, after all, the linear magnitude in either
case is certainly as small as could be expected.        One cannot
help remarking here, that the remeasurement of the French
meridian-arc, with all modern refinements of observation and
calculation, with a considerable increase in the number of lati
tude stations, would be a vast service to science.

circumstances is to take simply the longitude-arc between
Bombay and Vizagapatam, as these points are nearly in the

north-eastern corner of Asia and passes through the southern

diameter of the equator passes through Ceylon on the one side

          surprising performances of the telephones of Bell and
THEEdison       rightly claim in a high degree the interest of
natural philosophers.     The solution (facilitated by it) of the
problem of the conveyance of tones and the sounds of speech
to distant places promises to give mankind a new means of
intercourse and culture which will essentially affect their social
relations and also render substantial service to science       and
                                                                 ;
hence  it  seems fitting that the Academy should draw these
exceedingly promising discoveries into the sphere of its contem
plations.
   The possibility of reproducing mechanically not merely
tones, hut also noises and spoken sounds, at great distances               is
given theoretically by Helmholtz's path-opening investiga
tions, which elucidated the essential nature of shades of tone
and the sounds of speech.
   If, as he has demonstrated, noises and sounds are only distin
guished from pure tones by the fact that the latter consist of
simple, the former of plurality of series of undulations, super
                          a
posed to one another, of the sonorific medium, and          if
                                                         the noises
of speech (Sprachgerdusche) may be conceived as irregular vi
brations with which the vocal sounds begin or end, then               it   is
also possible to reproduce mechanically a certain succession of
such vibrations at distant localities.    Indeed practical life has
in this, as frequently the case, outrun science.
             is                                        The hitherto
too little regarded so-called
                               " speaking telegraph," consisting
of two membranes stretched by strong and at the same time
                                       a
extremely light thread or fine wire which         fastened to their

be supported at any number of points by elastic threads of a
few inches length, and also, with similar elastic fastenings at
the angles, from any number of angles, without the apparatus
losing the capability of conveying with perfect distinctness
and correctness completely toneless whispered speech — a per
formance which previously no electric telephone could accom
plish. Although this
                          " speaking telegraph," or, more cor
rectly, "thread telephone," possesses no practical value (since
its working is still limited to short distances and is interrupted
by wind and rain), yet it is most deserving of notice, because
it proves that stretched membranes are fitted to take up,
almost completely, all the air-vibrations by which they are
struck, and to reproduce in another place all speech-sounds
and noises when mechanically put into similar vibrations.
    Reis, as is well known, was the first to endeavour to operate
the conveyance of tones by electric currents instead of a
stretched thread.     He made use of the vibrations of a mem
brane exposed to sound-waves to produce closing contacts of
a galvanic series.     The current-waves hereby generated tra
 versed, at the other end of the conduction, the coil of an
 electromagnet, which, provided with a suitable resonance-
 arrangement, again produced approximately the same tones
 by which the membrane, struck by the sound-waves, had been
 set vibrating.    This could only be done very imperfectly,
 since the contact-arrangements only became effective with the
 greater vibrations of the membrane, and. could only imperfectly
 render even these.
    Bell appears first to have had the happy thought to let the
 vibrating membrane itself call forth the currents serving for
 the transmission of its vibrations — making it of soft iron, and
 placing its centre opposite and very near to the end of a steel
 magnet wound round with insulated wire. By the vibrations
 of the membrane the attraction between the plate and the
 magnet, and therewith the magnetic potential of the wire-
 enveloped end of the bar-magnet, were alternately augmented
 and diminished ; by this, in the wire of the coil and in the
 conduction, currents were produced which, with the minute
 ness of the vibrations of the plate, generated electrical sine
 vibrations corresponding to the vibrations of the mass of air,
 which were thus in a condition to call forth again membrane-
 and air-vibrations in a similar apparatus at the other extremity
 of the conduction.     The result was unaffected by the circum
 stance that, as Du Bois-Reymond* has pointed out, in the
 receiving membrane the phases and ratios of amplitude of the
 partial tones are different from those in the emitting membrane.

   An essentially different path      was struck out by Edison (as
it appears, simultaneously with Bell).            He uses a galvanic
series, which sends a constant current through the conduction.
   At the sending end a layer of powdered graphite, which is
gently pressed between two metal plates insulated one from
the other, is inserted in the circuit.        The upper plate is fas
tened to the vibrating membrane, and presses the graphite
powder more or less together in correspondence with the air-
vibrations.    By this the resistance of the graphite to conduc
tion is correspondingly varied, and thereby sinusoid varia
tions, equivalent to the air-vibrations, are produced in the
intensity of the current passing through the conducting line.
As receiving-apparatus, Edison uses no membrane, but another
and quite peculiar contrivance.         It is based on the experience
that the friction between a piece of metal and a paper band
saturated with a conducting fluid and pressed against the
metal is diminished when a current passes through the paper
to the metal.      I have verified this remarkable phenomenon for
the case in which the direction of the current is such that
hydrogen is separated at the metal plate, or when the metal is
not oxidizable.      Hence the lessening of the coefficient of fric
tion by the current evidently proceeds from electrolytically
generated gases deposited on the plate of metal.            Surprising,
however,   remains    the almost  instantaneous    rapidity with which
the effect takes places even with very feeble currents.
   Now Edison attaches the metal plate, pressed against the
moist paper, to a sounding-board, and draws the moist paper,
which is carried over a roller, under the metal piece by con
tinual rotation of the roller.      If now the metal piece and the
roller (also of metal) be inserted in the galvanic circuit, the
variations produced in the current by the greater or less pres
sure of the graphite powder effect equivalent variations of the
friction-coefficient between the metal plate attached to the
sounding-board and the paper, whereby the former is put into
corresponding vibrations, which are communicated to tho
sounding-board, and through this to the air.
   Edison's telephone is very remarkable on account of the
novelty of the expedients employed in it ; but it is obviously
not yet complete for practical use; while Bell's telephone
has, in its remarkably simple form, been widely spread in a
short time, especially in Germany ; and already much mate
rial of experience has been accumulated for judging of its
usefulness.     Its principal defect consists in the feebleness of
the reproduced sounds, which, in order to be distinctly under
stood, require the sound-aperture to be pressed to the ear,
and at the other end an immediate speaking into it.               Per

feet quiet is necessary around     it,
                                    in order that the ear may
not be dulled and disturbed by extraneous noises.         A still
graver obstacle to its practical employment consists in this —
that it needs complete electrical calm.    As the currents are
extraordinarily feeble which are generated by the vibrating
iron membrane and put the membrane of the other instru
ment into similar vibrations, therefore also very weak extra
neous currents are sufficient to disturb the latter and bring to
the ear confusing noises of other origin.
   In order to procure fixed points for judging the intensity
of the currents which are effective in the telephone, placed
                                                         I
one of Bell's telephones, the magnet-pole of which was wound
round with 800 turns of copper wire 0'l millim. thick and
possessing a resistance of 110 mercury units, in    acircuit con
taining a Daniell's cell, with a commutator, by which the di
rection of the current was reversed 200 times in    a second.
   Without an inserted resistance, these current-waves pro
duced in the telephone an extremely inharmonious noise,
audible at a long distance, and almost intolerable close to the
ear.   By the insertion of a resistance, this noise was dimi
nished, but was still very loud after the insertion of 200,000
units.    If   Daniells were inserted, the noise was still di-
               6
sinctly audible through ten million units of resistance.     If12
Daniells and twenty million units of resistance were inserted,
the sound was decidedly more distinct than in the last prece
ding case. In like manner an increase in its intensity took
place when thirty and fifty millions of units were inserted
with 18 and 30 Daniells respectively.         This corroborates
Beetz's observation that electromagnetism, with equal cur
rent-intensity,     more quickly called forth in circuits of great
                   is
resistance    by correspondingly more intense electromotive
forces, than in circuits with little resistance and proportion
ately less electromotive forces, because the countercurrents
which arise in the windings of the electromagnet count for
more in the latter case than in the former.
    If in the circuit of the commutator the primary spiral of     a
small voltaic induction-coil was inserted, such as  is  ordinarily
employed by physicians, while the telephone and resistance-
scale were in the circuit of the secondary wire, with one
Daniell element a loud-sounding noise was still obtained when
fifty million mercury units were inserted and this remained
                                            ;
distinctly audible even when the secondary spiral was pushed
back right to the end of the primary.
   This sensitiveness of Bell's telephone to feeble currents ren
ders it  very useful as a galvanoscope, especially for the de
tection of feeble and rapidly changing currents, for which there

has hitherto been scarcely any other means of testing than
the contractions of the leg of a frog. Also, in measuring re
sistances by the bridge method, the telephone may often be
employed with advantage instead of the galvanometer in the
branch wire of the bridge ; but then it will be necessary to
 employ as resistances only straight wires stretched at a greater
distance from each other, as otherwise perturbations would
arise through induction.
    This perfectly explains the extreme sensitiveness of the
telephone to electrical disturbances in the conductor, which,
indeed, almost entirely excludes its application to lines above
ground if the same posts support wires which are used for
telegraphic correspondence. Even when two neighbouring
conducting wires on the same posts are employed to form the
conduction-circuit, in which case the electrodynamic as well
as the electrostatic induction proceeding from the other more
distant wires is in great part compensated, still every current
that passes through these wires is heard in the telephone as a
loud cracking noise rendering the speech of the telephone
quite unintelligible if it is frequently repeated.
    Far worse still are these disturbances if the earth is used
for closing the circuit.    Even when special earth-plates are
taken for the telephone-wire, or if gas- or water-pipes are
made use of for the same purpose, every current is distinctly
heard which is brought to earth through earth-plates in the
vicinity. Since, in the spreading of a current in the ground,
the electric potential diminishes with the cube of the distance
from the point at which the current enters the earth, this also
demonstrates    the uncommon sensibility of the telephone to
feeble currents.
   For these reasons, with overland conducting-wires tele
phones can only be employed if special posts are appropriated
to the support of the wires.      Further, the earth's conduction
can only be used in places where there are no telegraph-
stations, or where the earth-plates used for telegraphing are
at a good distance from those which serve for the telephone-
conductions.
   Notwithstanding this sensitiveness of Bell's telephone, it
conveys but very imperfectly the sound-waves by which its
membrane is struck to the corresponding membrane and the
ear applied to it.   When a loud-ticking watch was placed close
to the sound-aperture of a very sensitive telephone constructed
after Bell's plan, the ticking could not be heard in the other
telephone, even when the watch actually touched the telephone-
case.   On the other hand, the above-mentioned thread tele
phone transmitted the ticking through a thread about 20

metres long very distinctly ; it was still audible when the ear
was withdrawn 8 centims. from the month of the hearing-
tube. The ticking could be heard direct with about equal
distinctness at the distance of 130 centims. ; consequently
the thread telephone conveyed about ^£5 of the intensity of
the sound.      Since the electric telephone transmitted the softest
speech    intelligibly,  it must be on account of the rapid and ir
regular     vibrations   which form the toneless, even if louder,
noise of the ticking, that it cannot transmit the latter.
   From a like cause a proper, perfectly toneless whisper
cannot be understood through the electric telephone, while
through the thread telephone it is distinctly intelligible to a
distance of 20 metres.        Just so electric telephones, which re
produce the softest speech distinctly, do not convey at all, or
scarcely perceptibly, the loud but toneless clap of two pieces
of iron or glass struck together.
   It  is remarkable that the electric telephone, in spite of this
almost incapability of conveying the noises which consist of
rapid and irregular vibrations, yet so truly renders the quality
of musical tones and the sounds of speech that the voices of
the speakers can be almost as well recognized through the
telephone as direct from the speakers themselves.          The voice,
however, sounds somewhat fuller, which is to be ascribed to
the circumstance that the tones are reproduced better and
more powerfully than the noises of speech.             Singing, too,
sounds through the telephone, as a rule, softer and richer.
   In order to gain a fixed point for the solution of the ques
tion what fraction of the force of the sound which strikes the
membrane of the one telephone is given again by the other,          I
instituted some experiments with musical boxes.           The smaller
one,  which    gave   short  sharp tones,  could   be heard  by good
ears at 125 metres distance upon an open plain, while only
isolated tones could be heard through the telephone when it
was placed more than 0'2 of a metre from the musical box.
In this instance, therefore, only about ^^nni of *^e sound
was actually conveyed.         A somewhat larger musical box, of
not   so   high   a pitch, and giving tones of longer duration,
could not be heard in the open air much further than the
smaller one ; but the telephone at 1-2 metre distance caused
the tune played to be recognized.         This gives a conveyance of
about            of the sound-intensity received by the telephone.
         JA^JS
Now, although the sounds of speech, as well as deeper and
more sustained tones, are probably conveyed better than the
melody of the musical boxes, it cannot be assumed that a
 Bell telephone conveys, on the average, more than -niimi of
the mass of sound by which it is struck, to the other telephone.

                 Prof. W. Siemens on Telephony.
    It follows from the above that Bell's telephone, notwith
standing its surprising performances, effects the conveyance
of sound only in a very imperfect manner. That we can
understand the speech of the telephone excited by currents so
extraordinarily feeble, we owe to the extreme sensibility and
great range of our organ of hearing, which enable it to bear
the sound of a cannon at 5 metres distance, and yet to hear it
at a distance of 50 kilometres, consequently to have the sen
sation of sound from air-vibrations within a range of from 1
to 100,000,000-fold intensity.
   Accordingly the telephone needs, and is in a high degree
capable of, improvement.      Although it is not possible entirely
to do  away with loss of sound (which would be approximately
accomplished if it could be effected that the vibrations of the
second membrane should possess the same amplitude as those
of the first), since in the repeated transformations of motions
and forces there must always be a loss of vis viva by conver
sion into heat, yet the present disproportion is much too great.
But by diminishing this loss, and thereby strengthening the
arriving sound, we should secure that the hearing would need
less exertion, and could distinctly perceive and distinguish the
transmitted sounds at a greater distance from the instrument.
Then also the perturbations produced by extraneous feeble
electric currents would be felt less disturbing, because they
would be covered by the more powerful arriving speech-
sounds.
    Hereby is also given the direction which must be taken for
 the improvement of Bell's telephone.        In order to produce
 more intense currents, the membrane destined to receive the
sound-waves must be sufficiently large and of such a consti
 tution that the sound-waves striking its surface can impart to
it a maximum of their vis viva ; while the membrane must bo
sufficiently movable for its vibrations not to be too small ; and
the work expended for the production of the electric currents
must be so much that the vis viva accumulated in the vibra
tions of the membrane will be consumed by it — or, in other
words, so much as to make the membrane-vibrations aperiodic.
An enlargement of Bell's iron sheet would be advantageous
only withm narrow limits, since larger and correspondingly
thicker plates are apt to assume vibrations of their own, whicn
diminish the distinctness of the transmitted sounds.      It is also
requisite that the magnetic attraction of the iron plate in Bell's
telephone be not raised too high, as otherwise the plate is too
much curved and stretched in one direction, which likewise
 detracts from the clearness.
    I have tried, with considerable success, to strengthen the
                                H2

attraction between the iron membrane and the wire-coiled
nuignet-pole without bringing the former out of its position of
equilibrium, by bringing it between the poles of a powerful
horse-shoe magnet.
    The pole which was above the iron plate had the shape of
a ring, the opening of which formed the sound-hole, while the
lower pole of the horse-shoe supported the iron pin with a wire
coil opposite to the centre of the sound-aperture.          The mem
brane itself consisted of iron only in the middle, as far as it
was opposite to the ring-shaped pole, while the other portion
 was made of sheet-brass, to which the iron was soldered.
Through the action of the magnetic iron ring the middle of
 the iron plate became itself strongly magnetic ; consequently
there was a very much strengthened attraction between it and
the magnetic iron pin placed opposite to              while the iron
                                                         it,
plate, attracted with equal force on both sides, remained, with
the whole membrane, in the position of equilibrium, and could
therefore vibrate freely towards both sides.
    Another modification consisted in making both poles of the
 magnet ring-shaped, and providing them with short notched
 iron tubes wrapped round with spirals. There were now
 exactly opposite to the iron plate two ring-shaped magnet-
poles of the same kind, while itself possessed the opposite
polarity.    This is  the combination    Ioften employ with good
 results in so-called polarized relays, in which the movable,
powerfully magnetized iron tongue            situated between two
                                              is
oppositely magnetic poles of magnet, at equal distance from
                                     a
each, of which the ends are provided with coils.
    This arrangement has also been approved for telephonic
call-signal apparatus.      If   point in the rim of

   If  in this way the capabilities of the telephone can be con
 siderably heightened, yet, in retaining Bell's iron membrane,
 we are restricted within rather narrow limits, both as regards
 the size of the membrane      for receiving the sound and the
 strength  of  the effective magnetism, an excess of which reu

ders the speech-sounds indistinct and accompanies them with
a strange, unpleasant clang.
    Hence, for the construction of larger telephones delivering
                                     I
much more powerful currents, do not use any vibrating plate
of iron, but 1 fix to the membrane that receives the sound
waves (which is made of non-magnetic material) a light coil
of wire which waves freely in a ring-shaped strongly magnetic
field.     By the vibrations of the coil, intense currents alterna
ting in direction are induced in         it, which at the other extre
mity    of  the conduction  set  in  similar  vibrations either the coil
of a similar instrument or the iron membrane of Bell tele    a
phone.
    As the breadth of flat membrane cannot exceed rather
                            a
narrow limits without confusing the speech-sounds trans
mitted, by the advice of Prof. Helmholtz       I      have given to the
membrane the form of the tympanum of the ear.                 This form
is  obtained, according to Helmholtz, when a moist skin of
parchment or   a    bladder     stretched over the rim of
                                is                           a ring, and
then its centre gradually depressed to the desired depth by           a
screw or otherwise. The membrane will then retain this form
after drying.      If  now   a model be made after this form in
metal, with its aid membrane of sheet-brass, or, better, alu
                        a
minium can be pressed so as to have the same form as the
former.       Membranes of this shape are especially suitable for
the reception of sound-waves and for the transference of their
vis viva to masses that are to be set vibrating         (apurpose which
they have to fulfil in the ear also), since their flexion results
chiefly near the margin of the membrane — while in flat mem
branes   it   takes place more in the vicinity of the centre, and
 hence with these only those sound-waves which strike the
 middle of the plate come into full action.            Such  atelephone

 thickness, in a    magnetic field of great intensity generated by
a   powerful electromagnet, transmits with perfect distinctness
 to  a great number of smaller telephones every sound produced
 in any part of a room of moderate size and the purity and

 musical notes are remarkable — which may arise partly from
 the appropriate form of the membrane, and partly from the
 coil, on moving in the cylindrical magnetic field, generating
 more regular sinusoid currents than           a  vibrating iron plate.
 An apparatus in which such          a wire coil   is moved rapidly up
 and down by means of a winch with             a   long connecting-rod
 could be usea with advantage for the generation of sine-cur-
 rents of great intensity.

102            Prof. W. Siemens on Telephony.
  For giving back       the sounds of speech the tympanic form
of memorane is not so well suited. It also appears generally
more to the purpose to employ larger and more powerful in
struments for giving, and smaller instruments of more delicate
and lighter construction for receiving, at the same time bring
ing the instrument into the most suitable position for the ear.
    Too powerful receiving-apparatus have the drawback, that
the countercurrents produced by the vibrations of their mem
brane weaken the moving currents and displace the trains of
sinusoid waves of the induced currents, by which the speech
is made indistinct and assumes strange shades of sound.
    It is scarcely to be assumed generally that telephones on
Bell's principle (in which the sound-waves themselves have to
 perform the work of exciting the currents required for their
 conveyance) will be successfully produced so as to utter speech
 distinctly intelligible at a greater distance from the telephone ;
 and, as we have already insisted, it is quite impossible of at
 tainment that they should reproduce not weakened the mass
 of sound by which their membrane is struck, or even re
 inforced.    This possibility, however, is not excluded when a
 galvanic battery is used for putting in motion the membrane
 of the receiving- apparatus, which then accomplishes the work
 to be expended. Heis endeavoured to effect this by means of
 contacts, Edison with the aid of powdered graphite inserted
 in the conduction-circuit of the battery.
   Contacts will hardly operate with sufficient constancy and
certainty for the sounds of speech to be given back with purity.
But it is possible that the solution of the problem lies in tne
course taken by Edison ; it therein only depends on the dis
covery of a material or an arrangement by means of which
changes in the resistance of the circuit may be produced con
siderable in amount and proportional to the amplitude of the
vibrations of the membrane. The form and quality of gra
phite powder are too variable to accomplish this with certainty.
Experiments which      I have commenced with other arrange
ments have not at present given any satisfactory result.
Nevertheless Edison's procedure remains well worthy of con
sideration, as it possibly forms the key to a future important
development of telephony.
      If,
       however, telephonic instruments are susceptible of fur
ther extensive improvement, the conducting-lines will always
confine the circle of their application within rather narrow
limits.   Even   if, as we have already shown to be indispen
sable, special posts be appropriated to telephone-lines, carrying
 no telegraph-wires, and double lines be everywhere employed
 for the telephones, yet even the telephonic messages on several

                 Prof. W. Siemens on Telephony.                 103
lines attached to the same posts would soon, with increasing
length of the lines, be disturbed one by another, not only
through imperfect insulation permitting side currents to pass
over to neighbouring wires, but also through the production
of secondary currents in them by electrodynamic and electro
static induction, generating confusing sounds.       In telegraph-
lines electrodynamic induction can, as a rule, be entirely
neglected, because it does not increase with the length of the
line, if the resistance of the wire coils be left out of considera
tion, and because the duration of the electrodynamically in
duced currents is too short to affect the telegraphic instru
 ments ; but in telephonic apparatus the brief currents generated
by voltaic induction produce very audible sounds if the con-
ducting-lines run side by side for only a short distance.
    Further, secondary electrostatic induction, increasing as the
squares of the length of the conducting-line, will soon, as the
overland lines become longer, put a limit to the employment
of the telephone, even when the telephone-wires only are fixed
to the same posts.
    The circumstances are much more favourable in this respect
for the telephone when underground or submarine lines are
employed. Before       I had ascertained that the intensity of the
currents which yet are capable of exciting the telephone to
the production of clearly intelligible speech-sounds is so ex
tremely slight,    I doubted the practicability of employing sub
terranean wires for great distances, on account of the great
weakening which the current-waves called forth by rapidly
alternating    electromotive forces in the conductmg-wires
would undergo with the length of the conduction.          The expe
riments, however, which Postmaster-General Dr. Stephan (to
whom the German Empire owes the reintroduction of the
underground wires that had for a quarter of a century almost
fallen into oblivion) caused to be made with Bell telephones,
gave the surprising result that with them people can speak
with perfect distinctness and quite intelligibly at distances of
about sixty kilometres.     Hence it is very probable that, with
telephones of more powerful action, adequate intelligibility
will be attained at twice or even three tunes that distance.
This, at all events, may be the extreme distance at which tele
phonic correspondence is generally practicable.
    Unfortunately, even in underground conducting wires dis
turbances by return currents from the earth, as well as by
electrodynamic and electrostatic induction, are not excluded.
The former could be pretty completely got rid of, as in lines above
ground, by the emplovment of entirely metallic conduction-
circuits, with the exclusion of the earth as return conductor.

104              Prof. W. Siemens on Telephony.
The same holds good in the case of disturbances produced by
induction, if the two insulated conductors forming a telephone-
circuit are united into a separate cable encased with iron wires.
If, on the contrary, as is usually done for the sake of saving
expense, a greater number of insulated conductors are com
bined in one cable, voltaic as well as static induction makes
its appearance in augmented measure on account of the
slightness of the distance between them, and act very dis
turbingly on the telephonic correspondence. This secondary
electrostatic induction occurs perturbingly even in long cables
 for telegraphic correspondence, with which very sensitive ap
paratus must be employed. Hence                     I
                                                have proposed, for
avoiding   it, to  provide  the  individual   conductors  which are
 combined   in   acable containing several     wires with a conduc
 ting metallic sheath in conducting connexion with the outer
iron spinning or with the earth. Even encasing the insulated
 individual conductors with thin layer of tin toil gets rid of
                                   a
 secondary electrostatic induction completely.         Any one can
 easily convince himself of this by experiment              if
                                                       he places one
 upon the other two mica or thin gutta-percha plates, each
lined on both sides with tin foil.           If
                                            the inner linings be in
sulated and the charge between the outer ones be tested by
the deflection of    agalvanometer by connecting the free pole
of battery led away to earth with one of the outside sheets
   a
of tin foil, while the second       connected through the galva
                                   is
nometer-wire with the earth, or in a similar manner by aid of
the commutator, as great                   obtained as if the sheets
                                charge

in the middle were absent.         But   the latter are connected
with the earth, no trace      isobtained of secondary charge in
                                                   a
the tin foil connected with the galvanometer.
    We get the same negative result when the individual insu
lated conductors of      acable consisting of several such have
been tightly wrapped round with tin foil or strips of thin plate
of any metal. The metallic conductive casing, though very
thin, completely prevents any secondary electrostatic induc
tion or charge of one conductor by the charge of another.
On the other hand, however, the electrodynamic induction
exerted   by the wires upon one another        not thereby removed,
                                                   is
as Foucault asserted     *.
    This can easily be convincingly shown by simple experi  a
ment.    If  two wires, insulated with gutta percha or caout
chouc, be wound together upon roller, powerful charge as well

encasing the individual conductors with tin foil or other conducting sub
stances, with the expressed purpose of compensating electrodynamic in
duction by the countercurrents arising in the tin casing.

as  voltaic-induction currents are to be observed in one of the
wires when a galvanic series is alternately closed and opened
by the other. If the roller be now placed in a vessel, and this
be little by little filled with water, the charge-currents in the
former wire diminish, and cease altogether when the water
quite fills up the intervals between the wires, whereas the elec-
trodynamically induced currents become even more intense.
     For telegraph-conductions these electrodynamically induced
currents are, as we have already remarked, of no consequence,
 since they do not increase with the length of the conduction ;
but the telephone, being so extremely sensitive, is still excited
by them if the inducing currents are not extraordinarily feeble.
 It will therefore be necessary to lay down special cables for
telephones, just as special posts are needed for them when the
 wires are carried above ground.
     As follows from the above, the telephone is still capable of
 essential improvement; in a short time telephones will as
 suredly be constructed which will convey both speech and
 musical tones beyond comparison more loudly, more distinctly,
 and with greater purity to moderate distances than they have
 been hitherto by the Bell telephone.        The telephone will then
 render service to intercourse in cities and between neighbour
 ing towns which will far surpass what the telegraph can per
 form for short distances.         The telephone is an electrical
  speaking-tube which, just like an ordinary speaking-tube, can
 be managed by every one, and can be a perfect substitute for
 personal conversation ; but as at very short distances it will
  never supplant the speaking-tube, just as little will it be able
 to take the place of the telegraph for greater distances.       Yet
  in the limited circle of its practicability it will soon be num
 bered among the most important pillars of modern civilization,
 if external hindrances do not prevent its development and
 application.

  §
           J-   (§88), and the want of evidence of simple arithme
  tical relationship between the atomic numbers of the water and
  salt of almost all these bodies, invited me to reexamiue a few of
  the most definite and stable crystalline salts containing water.
  And this invitation was the more pressing because, in the

106             Frederick Guthrie on Salt Solutions
matter of the determination of water of crystallization, analysts
have for the most part allowed themselves a far greater lati
tude in respect to agreement between the experiment made and
the conclusion drawn than they have been willing to admit in
regard to the other constituents of the salt. Prominent in
respect to agreement between experiment and the derived
constitution are the investigations of Graham, especially on
the water of crystallization of single and double sulphates.
Such accord is so rare, that in a very great many instances
the experiments actually point to a different water-worth than
that adopted by the. experimenter.
     That heat is sometimes liberated and sometimes absorbed
when a salt is brought into contact with water, not only ac
cording to the nature of the anhydrous constituents, but also
to the degree of hydration, has long since shown that there is
some essential difference in the tension of the union which is
established between the water on the one hand, and the more
or less hydrated anhydride on the other. But the statements
as to the conditions under which a salt becomes anhydrous, or
 exists in combination with a definite relative number of mole
cules of water, are neither definite nor satisfactory. The state
ment that a salt gives up n molecules of water when heated to
the temperature E is inexact, (1) unless the hygrometric state
 of the air is given, (2) unless it is known whether free circu
 lation takes place, and (3) unless the pressure on the salt is
known.       The statement that a salt gives up m molecules of
water in vacuo (over a desiccator) is also ambiguous, in so far
as it ignores the temperature.
     The salt which    I first examined in this respect was chloride
of barium, BaCl2 + 2 H2 O (BaCl + 2 HO), it being a salt easily
 got quite pure and of a stable nature. The
                                                        " pure " salt of
 commmerce was recrystallized, boiled with carbonate of barium,
 filtered and precipitated, and washed with alcohol. It was
 then twice recrystallized.        It was then finely powdered, and a
 part  A  was   dried  for  forty-eight hours in a good vacuum at a
 temperature of about 17° C. ; a part B was dried between
 repeatedly renewed bibulous paper in a screw-press for the
same time.       Two analyses of each were made, the elements
being    estimated   in the usual way.

   From these analyses, and from the direction of their diver
gence from the theoretical composition of the salt, there can
be no doubt about the composition of the salt ; nor is there any
doubt that the water is present in simple molecular ratio.
Accordingly the hydrated chloride of barium is admirably
adapted for examination as to the conditions under which it
gives up water. The only statement              I  can find in this respect
is that the hydrated salt gives up the whole of its water at
100° C.
    § 185. A two-ounce flask with the lip cut off was provided
with a glass cap for use alone in the balance-case : the figure
explains the rest. A given volume of air (measured by the
 quantity of water leaving the gasometer) is drawn in a given
 time over a thin layer of the hydrated salt, while the latter is
 heated to a given temperature.            The air passes first through
 a long tube containing fragments of hydrate of potassium, and
 then through a tube containing glass and sulphuric acid.

  As the flask  had to be left for half an hour in the balance-
case every time before weighing, the above experiments occu
pied a few weeks.    At the end of this time the flask was found
to have lost 0'00l? gram.
   Examining the final result as a direct determination of the
whole of the water,     I
                        found that the 4'1605 grams had lost
0'6087 gram, or 14'63 per cent., instead of the theoretical
amount 14'75.
    The actual weight of water which a given weight of the salt
lost at a given temperature in a given time has Tittle interest,
because it is conditioned by the attitude of the salt to the air-
current in the flask, and it is also governed by the rate.           But
points of very great interest are nevertheless presented when the
above numbers are compared. The first loss, at 17° C., may pro
bably be attributable to the more complete drying of the salt,
since no further loss was experienced at 25°.       Starting at 40°, a
considerable loss was experienced, which continued with very
considerable regularity until the residue approached in com
 position to the one-atom hydrate BaCIa + H2 O ; the loss then
 suddenly diminished and abruptly stopped.          The total loss ex
 perienced by the 4' 1605 grams of salt when this point was
 reached is 0'3009 — that    is,7'21 per cent.     As the percentage
 of water in BaCl2 + H2O           7'37, there can be no question
                                   is
 that there   is  difference in the strength of union of the two

     The minimum temperature required to disconnect the * mo

  at 40° C., lost weight distinctly at 60°, and still more rapidly
  at 70°.   On reducmg the temperature to 50° no loss could be
  detected;  at 60° the same as before, and at 70° the same as
  before.   At 55° there was no loss, nor at 58°, nor at 59° but                ;
  at 60° the original loss was reestablished.      And until the salt

                                                    loss at 26° is really
 continuous with the greater losses at higher temperatures.
The loss at 25° having been shown in Table XLI. to be inap
preciable, we may consider the loss to begin between 25° and
 26°.    It is observed that the rate, in Table XLII. is four times
as great as in Table XLI. ; and a consequence of this is that,
 for given volumes at the same temperature (40°), the losses are
 absolutely and relatively to the quantity less in Table XLII.
than in Table XLI., but not four times as small. [Hence,
as we might anticipate, at a given temperature and for a given
volume more water is withdrawn by a slow current than by a
 quick one ; while in a given time more water is withdrawn by
a quick current than by a slow one.              With regard to the first
 of these facts, it need only be remembered that the slow current
 becomes more saturated than the quick one.                 Although the

cessation    of loss is for both atoms sufficiently well marked and
abrupt, the final balance of water is retained in both cases with
considerable tenacity.
    In the second series of experiments the flask preserved its
weight exactly. The total loss on the 5-6462 grams was 0*4119
gram, showing a percentage loss of 7-277.
    The whole analysis now stands as follows, allowing for the
loss of the glass in the first series, for the salt dried over sul

    On mixing the body BaCl2 + H2 O with water a rise from
 21° to 27° (or 6°) was obtained. The anhydrous salt with
 water gave from 19° to 38° (or 19°).
     § 187. Briefly to recapitulate concerning BaCl2 + 2H2O.
 At the ordinary barometric pressure, and in a current of air
 dried and freed from carbonic acid, one water molecule is re
 moved at all temperatures above 25° C., the other at all tempe
 ratures above 60 C. In the figure (p. 112) A shows the rates
 of loss of the /8 molecule in tenths of milligrams, the ordinates
 being proportional to such losses. The abscissae are the tempe
 ratures. B shows the losses in like manner of the « molecule.
              Chromatic Value     of other Media than Water.
     § 188. There are few media besides water which dissolve
 metallic salts. Amongst the few glycerine stands preeminent ;
 and this liquid is indeed comparable with water itself in its
 solvent power.         On account of this very solvent power, there
 appears to be at present no evidence of the replacement of water
 by glycerine in solid hydrated salts, similar to the replacement
 in siliceous jellies.      Some glycerates (using the term homolo-
 gously with hydrates) are well-defined bodies enough ; and the
  properties of some new ones will be described subsequently.
  Here   I shall confine myself to the description of the effect upon
  the colours of a few salt solutions, according as the solvent is
  water or glycerine.         Being partially what is called " colour
  blind,"   I  have, of course, availed myself of the services of my
  friends in describing the appearances presented.
      § 189. Many are entertaining the idea of the relationship

of bringing before the Physical Society on the 16th of March,
1878, 1 described the spreading of the acid and alkaline ions
through the uumelted jelly.               These results   I  do not publish,
because a friend          has  had the great kindness to point out to me
 that many of the results which were then exhibited had been
obtained several years previously by Dr. AV. M. Ord. The
experiments and speculations of Dr. Ord are contained in a
 very remarkable and suggestive series of papers contributed
 chiefly to the St. Thomass Hospital Reports . Amongst the
jellies which       I   then prepared but did not exhibit, was a stiff
 gelatine     jelly    saturated   with sulphate of copper.           This jelly
 was     of a bright emerald-green by          transmitted     light.    On ex
 posure to the air of a portion which had not been subjected
 to electrolysis, the water gradually evaporated and the salt
 began to crystallize out.            The form of the crystalline masses
 was curiously modified by the jelly.                Rounded masses were
 formed, reminding one of my friends of the coccoliths of the
 deep-sea dredgings
                              — another, of the mineral or uric concretions
 which occur in mucous media — and yet another, of "chlorite."
  Whether there be, as is most likely, a common cause, a colloid
 medium, in all the three cases,            I must not here discuss.        The
  ultimate crystalline element is too minute fordetermination; but
 the elements of secondary form invariably re
  semble (1).          These elements are frequently
  linked two by two in one plane (2), or at right
  angles to one another (3). The convex sides
  are generally very deeply furrowed, so as to
  give the impression of their being four second-
  ray elements. These concretions can bo picked
  out of the jelly in which they form, like
  almonds out of a cake.            So clean is their se
  paration,     and   so  feeble their  blackening when
  heated with oil of vitriol, that they must be                 m

       SUBJECT    Paper. — The object of the present paper
                        of                                                   is
        the description of series of experiments made
                                   a                      the           by
author upon the transmission of vocal and other sounds by
 wires, and the results obtained from those experiments.
    2. Transmission      Sound in general. — The transmission of
                             of
 sound by various media        familiarly illustrated from day to
                                  is
 day and the readiness
       ;                    with which these media are affected
 has been made the subject of many experiments.
    One familiar illustration of the transmission of sound from
 air to solids and thence back to the air       that which occurs in
                                                      is
 the vertical and horizontal partitions between rooms, such as
 partition walls and floor and ceiling spaces — the sounds origi
 nating in one room being thus transmitted to the adjoining
 room without having recourse directly to air communication.
    From a consideration of the latter, as also from other phe
 nomena, the author has for some time been convinced that
 vocal sounds might be transmitted by solid bodies, such as
  wires, and that to considerable distances.
    After several unsuccessful atttempts, the author daring the
  month of January last, having occasion to use some fine
  copper wire, carried    portion of
                              a          out from the house to dis

116          Mr. W.   J.  Millar OH tie Transmission
disks with low rims to the ends of the wire : the transmission
of vocal sounds was then found to be easily effected, conversa
tion being readily carried on through this length of wire.
   Since that time the author has made many experiments with
various combinations and under various circumstances. The
principle upon which they all more or less appear to depend,
so far as the rendering audible of the sounds, is that of the
tuning-fork and sounding-box, in which the sound from the
vibratory movements of a metal body is considerably intensi
fied when the body is placed upon a sonorous substance affect
ing the air in its vicinity.
   3. Notes of some of the more important Experiments.
   (1) No. 23 copper wire was stretched between windows out
side of house, and attachments at right angles made to rooms
through the windows.       Speaking in one room was then heard
in the other; the distance was about 20 yards. Pianoforte
music was easily transmitted by placing an ear-piece inside
the instrument and carrying the other end of the wire outside
the house.
   (2) No. 40 copper wire fitted up in a building, passing
from room to room as per diagram below. Six attachments ana
angles.

             of Vocal and other Sounds     l>y   Wires.       117
   Distance about 50 yards. Conversation. singing, whistling,
breathing, and the sound of  a    lightC tuning-fork (2£ inches
in fork) readily transmitted.
   Various similar arrangements were also made in house from
room to room, and finally carried to   a distance outside, when
all the above effects, as also the transmission of whispering,
were clearly demonstrated,     the persons at either end being
quite out of hearing in the ordinary manner.
   The communication was not limited to the persons at either
end of the wire
              ;   additional connexions were occasionally made,
when three or more individuals could communicate with each
other.
  (3) Carried about   7yards of No. 23 copper wire from one
room through an adjoining one to   a  room beyond, the wire in
its course passing below two doors shut above       and for the
                                                       it,
most part in contact with the carpet, but fastened at the ends
so as to produce some tension.       Made two connexions of
No. 40 copper wire at angles with the main wire; conversa
tion was then readily carried on, and all the phenomena
already described produced.     Subsequent experiments with
No. 16 copper wire arranged as above were found to yield
better results.
   A somewhat similar and equally successful experiment was
made by carrying the same size of wire down stairs, passing
below two doors and partly resting on carpet and wood.          A
positive advantage    isgained by resting the heavy wire in
this manner, the words being clearer and more distinct, and
free from the rumbling sound occurring with     suspended wire
                                                   a
free to move about.
  (4) Fastened No. 23 copper wire to telegraph-wire,          made
another and similar attachment 75 yards further on, but within
two posts.     Breathing, whistling, and tuning-fork sounds
readily transmitted.
   (5) Carried the latter attachment to 150 yards, thus pass
ing one post.    Breathing, whistling, singing, and the sound of
the light C    tuning-fork, formerly mentioned, readily trans
mitted. No apparent loss though passing the support (the latter
was of the usual china-ware cup with binding-wire).          The
speaking was not so distinct, although the different       word-
sounds were discernible.      This can be accounted for by the
fact that, as the poles were about 14 feet high, the attachment-
ends were free to swing about, which, combined with the ex
posed situation of the main line, gave rise to       considerable

as to rest partly on grass, and fastened up at the ends to pins ;
attachments were made, and vocal sounds transmitted : whis
 tling and the tuning-fork sounds very clearly heard, although
 a  high wind was blowing at the time.
    4. The Mouth- and Ear-pieces. — The mouth- and eiir-pieces
 used in these experiments have been of various materials and
 forms. The materials tried have been pasteboard, wood, gutta-
 percha, india-rubber, parchment, iron, tin, and zinc. These
 have generally been arranged as disks or drums, having a
 more or less extended rim around them to confine the
 sounds.    This rim has been of cylindrical, conical, and other
 forms.
    In general, greater volume of sound accompanied increased
depth of rim ; but the sounds were hardly so distinct as when
the rim was kept shallower.
    The wire was usually attached to centre of disk ; but in
some cases good results were got where the wire was led
through a cylindrical hollow piece of wood and terminated
close to the disk ; indeed a hollow piece of wood without a
disk did very well.
    As a rule, the effects seemed better when the wire was led
outside of the house.
    High-pitched voices are more easily heard than deep strong
roices.
    In the experiments with the telegraph-wire one of the disks
used was of thin sheet-iron 3J inches in diameter.       Set in a
wooden rim about -£ inch deep, the wire was fastened into a
small piece of wood, which in turn was cemented down to
centre of disk. The tuning-fork sounds were very well heard
with this arrangement ; and one peculiarity was that, on the
wooden fastening accidentally breaking away from the iron,
the sounds could again be heard by holding the disk in one
hand and pressing the wooden termination of the wire upon
the disk with the other.
    5. Wires. — The wires, as a rule, require to be more or less
tightened up ; but this varies with the heaviness of the wire.
    The sound is increased with a tight wire.
    The volume of sound appears, to be increased with a heavy
wire.    Thus in the telegraph-wire about ^ inch thick, pro
bably No. 8, the sounds were stronger and fuller than in the

             On Brass Wind Instruments as Resonators.                119
thinner wires, and, probably owing to the high tension of the
former, faint sounds were more readily transmitted : thus the
accidental or intentional touching of the tuning-fork with the
rim of the mouth-piece, causing a slight clicking sound, was
distinctly heard through the ear-piece at a distance of 150
yards —and this, even although the two attachments of copper
wire were practically at right angles to the main wire, whereby
part of the sound would pass away onwards up and down the
line.
    6. The great delicacy of the action maybe inferred from the
fact that fine sand strewn upon the disk of the ear-piece is
unaffected by conversation through lengths of about 7 yards.
The sensitiveness also of the mouth-piece was shown by sounds
not spoken into it being readily transmitted, such as coughing,
laughing, or remarks made by persons standing beside the in
strument.      Indeed, in some cases an advantage is obtained by
keeping back from the mouth- or ear-pieces ; and the author
has sometimes thought an improvement was obtained by hold
ing the ear-piece slightly inclined to the ear.
    In all cases the individual voice could easily be distinguished
though modified more or less by the structure and material of
 the mouth- and ear-pieces.
    The mouth- and ear-pieces were usually of the same form
 and material, and were therefore used for either speaking or
hearing. Borne forms, however, do better as ear-pieces, others
 as mouth-pieces.
    In conclusion, the author believes that many interesting
 physical questions may be studied by means of these arrange
 ments, and that practical application may be made where com
 munication of this nature is required.
        XVI.     On Brass Wind Instruments as Resonators.
                        By D.   J. BLAIKLEY*.
                               [Plate I.]
        bringing   before the    Physical    Society a few notes and
 IN experiments       on this subject, I would      desire to say that
 they are the result of an attempt to carry somewhat more into
                          I
 detail than, as far as am aware, has hitherto been done, some
 acoustical investigations of the late Sir C. Wheatstone.              A
 most interesting paper     on Wheatstone's     work  in  this field was
 brought before the Musical Association^by Professor W. G.
   * Communicated by    the Physical Society,  having been read May 25,
 1878.

120           Mr. D.    J.   Blaikley on Brass Wind
Adams in 1876    ;   and to that paper   I   am in great measure in
debted.
  A brass instrument may be defined as a resonator capable of
reinforcing a certain fundamental periodic vibration originated
by the lips, and all such vibrations as have for their relative
numbers 2, 3, 4, &c. when the fundamental note is represented
by unity, — these vibrational numbers being the basis of what is
known as the natural harmonic series of musical intervals —
and this series being the same, whatever may be the absolute
pitch of the fundamental note or the character of tone of the
instrument.
     It is possible to make the lips give notes which, although
scarcely audible, are of definite pitch, without the use of an
instrument, just as a tuning-fork gives its proper note with or
without a resonator.
     There are two simple forms of resonators which give the
series of notes required in wind instruments : these are the
open tube of equal section throughout, and the cone complete
to its apex, where it is of course closed.    In the tube the wave
 length of any note is inversely proportional to its vibrational
number ; and the nodes or points of maximum compression
 and rarefaction, and the centres of the ventral segments, or
 points of maximum amplitude of vibration are equidistant: but
 in the cone this is not the case. Wheatstone found experi
 mentally that the notes of a closed cone agree in pitch with
 those of an open tube of the same length ; and therefore the
 prime or fundamental tone of such a cone is an octave higher
 than the prime of a closed tube of the same length. He found
 also that in conic frustra of similar lengths, but of different pro
 portions as regards the diameters of their ends, the pitch varied,
 risingas the difference between the two ends increased when the
  small end was closed, and becoming lower under the same condi
  tions when the large end was closed.     The accompanying dia
  gram (Plate I.)    shows the positions  of the nodes and centres
  of ventral segments in an open tube and a cone of the same
  length for the notes c, d,g', c", marked 1, 2, 3, 4         having
                                                               (<?
  128 vib., and a   wave-length of 105 in. at 60° F.). The nume
  rals grouped together and marked N show the positions of the
                                                    V'   S
nodal points or surfaces,      and those marked              the centres
                                                      2
of the ventral segments or points of maximum vibration. The
effect that the diminishing size of the cone has upon the posi
tion of the nodes may be easily traced.     Whilst the positions
of the centres of the ventral segments remain the same as in
the open tube (the numerals for these on the cone in the dia
gram falling exactly under those for the open tube), the nodes

are gradually further and further apart, dividing their respec
tive ventral segments more and more unequally, until at the
apex of the cone is a node common to all the notes.        It fol
lows from this that the centre of a ventral segment in a cone
is not the centre of the length between its nodes, and, con
versely, that as the diameters of the two ends of the ventral
segment approach equality, so does the position of the node
become more central, until the condition of vibration existing
in an open cylindrical tube is reached ; and such a tube may
evidently be considered as a portion of a cone whose apex is at
an infinite distance.   It is to be noticed that in the cone the
 number of £ wave-lengths, or semi- ventral segments, is not
 directly proportional to the vibrational number as in the open
 tube, but, with the exception of the fundamental note, is always
 in excess.   Thus let
                  N = number of            ^   wave-lengths,

    Brass instruments are generally considered to be cones, or
cones combined with cylindrical tubing, neither of which de

scriptions properly applies ; and this will endeavour to make
clear by experiment.       We may, in the first place, consider
whether the resonance of cones and tubing is influenced ap
preciably by the action of the lips ; and it will be found that,
whether the lips or a tuning-fork be used to excite the vibra
tion, the pitch is the same.     Two illustrations may be given —
the first a common hunting-horn, pitch c 512 when it is
blown, and giving an excellent resonance to the c 512 fork
when the mouthpiece is closed ;                     if,
                                         however, we slightly alter
its length either way, the resonance to the fork       no longer at         is
its maximum.      For  the second illustration,   take  cylindricalI         a
tube which becomes closed on being placed against the lips                        :

that     itvery difficult to alter any of them by the lips more
              is

its giving only the odd intervals.     The cone gives the required

 both the bugle and the cone,           will be noticed that there are
                                          it
 great differences. The nodes of note                 show this clearly.

     Thus, then, by altering the proportions of the different semi-

  ceived to be built up, the positions of the nodes may be so

  124            Mr. D.  J. Blaikley on .Brass Wind
 arranged that there shall be a node for every note of the har
 monic series at the mouthpiece as required ; and according as
 that is more or less perfectly effected will the instrument be
 more or less perfectly in tune.     This bugle is divided into its
 seven semi- ventral segments for its 4th note, c 512, according
 to the diagram ; and it will be found that by blowing at any
 one of the nodal points, with any length of the bugle contain
 ing an odd number of semi- ventral segments, the note c" can
 be produced.     The total number of pieces and combinations
 that can give this note is eighteen.
    Having given these few illustrations of the conditions upon
 which correct intonation, or the relative pitch of the different
 notes that can bo sounded on a brass instrument, depends,        I
 will now endeavour to show the connexion there is between
 this point and the question of quality of tone, understanding
 by quality of tone that characteristic of sound which enables
 us to recognize a difference between tones of the same pitch.
 Helmholtz has fully demonstrated that it is only in exceptional
 cases that we hear a simple musical tone — the vast majority of
 musical tones being in reality compound tones, in which the
 fundamental or prime tone has blended with it many upper
 partial tones of the natural harmonic series, — and that the
 variety of quality of tone depends mainly upon the number
 and intensity of these upper partial tones.     Blowing the note
 o256 on three resonators of different forms we get three di
 stinctly different qualities of tone : the resonators now used
are a. common paraffin-lamp chimney, the conic frustum
already shown (having for its first two proper tones d and c"#),
 and the bugle.     Analyzing these three tones by tuning-forks
 or resonators, we find that the lamp-chimney of irregular form
 gives no upper partials ; the tone is pure or simple. The cone
has the second and third partials sounding, but not strongly,
as it is not strictly in tune for them, or, in other words, there
is a difference of phase between the prime tone and the par
tials. And the bugle has all the partials up to the seventh,
gradually diminishing in power, but all tolerablv strong up to
the fifth inclusive.    Slightly altering the form of the cone by
adding tubing to the narrow end, and maintaining the original
pitch of the prime tone (c 256), by cutting a portion off the wide
end the pitch of the second tone may be altered until it is
c 512, an exact octave from the prime ; and we find that the
quality of tone of the prime or fundamental note is altered,
owing to the more perfect resonance which the cone now gives
to its second partial. In its original form, with proper tones
d-c$", the cone could give but an imperfect resonance to c",
the second partial to its prime d.

                   Instruments as Resonators.                 125
    In  the trombone and the euphonion we have two instru
ments of very different and characteristic qualities of tones —
the trombone being brilliant and piercing, and the euphonion
mellow.      We may take the B|? of about 120 vibrations (army
pitch)   on each of these and endeavour to give a visible proof
of the existence of high upper partial tones. For this purpose
I  use small tubular resonators covered at one end with a tightly
strained diaphragm or tympanum of goldbeater's skin, against
the centre of which is hung a' very small bead, or drop of
sealing-wax, by means of a single thread of cocoon-silk.     The
two resonators now used are tuned respectively to the fourth
and ninth partials of Bt>, or b^ of 480 vibrations and d" of
1024. When the proper tone of such a resonator is sounded
in its neighbourhood, either as a simple tone or as a partial in
a compound tone, the agitation of the membrane puts the bead
in violent motion, which can easily be seen in the image thrown
on the screen by the electric lamp. It will be noticed that
when Bt> is sounded, either on the euphonion or on the trom
bone, both resonators are agitated — but that the excursions of
the bead due to the partial tone of 1024 vibrations are much
greater with the latter than with the former instrument,
although both are played with but moderate force, thus
proving that, though partials as high as the ninth exist in the
quality of tone produced by both these instruments, yet in the
trombone the upper partials have much greater strength than
 in the enphonion.    With a resonator more suitable for private
experiment than these,     I have distinctly heard the sixteenth
 partial tone in the B(? of the trombone. A tapering tube open
at both ends, or a common wine-bottle with the bottom knocked
 out, is very convenient for analyzing tones. Sinking such a
tube in water and holding the ear close against the small end,
 the various partials existing in a given compound tone may be
 readily discerned, as the length of the tube changes according
to the depth it is immersed in tho water.
    Although one wind instrument may be made to approach
another in quality of tone by means of different methods of
 blowing, and it is therefore not so easy to analyze the tones of
these as it is those of keyed instruments with fixed tones, yet
 I have endeavoured to establish some general data ; and these  I
 will lay before you. The instruments the tones of which        I
 have analyzed are the Bb tenor trombone, tho B[j euphonion,
the F French horn, the B[? cornet, and the bugle. The par
 tial tones named in the Table are those heard when the instru
 ments are gently blown ; with loud blowing higher tones can
be discerned.     The ordinary marks of musical expression, pp,

  While submitting that the different qualities of tone are ac
counted for by the difference in the number and force of the
upper partials in any given compound tone,               must at the                    I
same time acknowledge that          can do no more than throw out
                                               I
a few suggestions with respect to the causes that influence the
production of such upper partials in this remarkable manner.
The partials being in the natural harmonic series,            evident                             it   is
that    the various proper tones of a vibrating column of air
       if
such as       enclosed in a wind instrument are not in exact
               is
agreement    with  this series, the resonance to the partials can
not be at its best.    Take for illustration two instruments no
minally the same (say two bugles), but with somewhat differ
ent qualities of tone.     Suppose that     certain compound tone
                                                               a
on both   should  have  its first and  second  partials of equal in
tensity, but that one instrument has that one of its proper
tones that     nearest in pitch to the required second partial a
                is
semitone sharper than that partial         the supposed compound
                                                              ;
tone  sounded  on  that instrument   will be deficient in the quality
the second partial should give.
   As regards instruments of different characters, the chief
points influencing the tone are the general form of the instru
ment (understanding by this the proportions of the column of
air, and not the shape into which the instrument may be bent
up for the convenience of the player), the extent of the flan
ging of the bell, and the form of the mouthpiece. As an

                     Instrumentt as Resonaiws.                    127
illustration of the first of these conditions the trombone may
be compared with the euphonion ; the tubing of the trombone
is cylindrical for about two thirds of its length from the mouth
piece, but the euphonion opens with gradually increasing cur
vature from the mouthpiece to the rim of the bell. The high
upper partials being more powerful on the former than on the
latter instrument, it would appear that the cylindrical tubing
has the power of maintaining the intensity of the short waves
to a greater extent than the tapering tubing has.          The bell-
flange may be increased in size to a considerable degree with
out altering the pitch of an instrument ; but such increase has
a marked effect on the quality of tone, greatly subduing the
force of the upper partials.      I find by experiment that the pitch
is not altered by the extension of the flange curvature beyond
a point at which its tangent would make an angle of about 40°
 with the axis of the instrument, although the quality of tone
 is decidedly altered by such extension.      This may be illustrated
 by changing the bell-end of a bugle for a bell with much wider
 flange, more like that of a French horn : comparing the two,
 it will be noticed that the change in quality of tone is very
 marked.
    The form of the cup of the mouthpiece varies for different
 instruments, from that of a long deep conical funnel to that of
 a comparatively shallow well-rounded cup — the first form
 representing the French-horn mouthpiece, and the second the
 mouthpiece for instruments of brilliant tone, as the trumpet
 and trombone; those for cornets, bugles, and saxhorns are of
 an intermediate character.         Although it is manifest that a
 shallow cupped mouthpiece favours the production of high
 upper partials,   I have not as yet succeeded in arranging any
 experiments which would illustrate the cause of this. One
 fact, however, noticed by many observers, appears to me to be
 suggestive, and worth bearing in mind in connexion with this
 subject.   It is this : — If a vibrating tuning-fork be placed on
 a sounding-board, the quality of tone it gives varies with the
pressure applied : touching the board very lightly with the
 fork the prime tone is well heard ; but on pressing the fork
 down to the board the tone appears to jump up an octave ; at
 least the second partial (octave of the prime) is heard with
great distinctness.      This experiment appears to prove that if
 an elastic resonant body (in this case the resonant board) is in
 a state of initial pressure at the point of origin of vibrations,
a vibration that would otherwise be simply pendular becomes
 a vibration compounded of two or more simple pendular vi
 brations.    Applying this consideration to wind instruments,
and bearing in mind the initial pressure caused by the escape

128          Prof. P. E. Chase on Radiation and Rotation.
of air from the lips, it would appear probable that mouth
pieces of different forms so modify this initial pressure as to
cause a variety in the number and intensity of the upper partial
tones.

    tation.    By PLINY EARLE CHASE, LL.D., S.P.A.S., Pro

                 the most interesting of the unsolved astronomical
 AMONG    problems   are the questions as to the origin of solar ra
 diation and of cosmical rotation.           These two problems, as     I
 have already shown, are intimately connected, at the centre of
 our system, by the ultimate equality which exists between the
 velocity of light, the limiting centrifugal velocity of solar ro
 tation, and the velocity of complete solar dissociation.
     It has been commonly assumed that physical forces tend to
 ultimate equilibrium and consequent complete stagnation. The
 imperfections of any plan which looks to such a final result
 have led some writers to suppose that there may be some com
 pensating provisions, hitherto undiscovered, for a renewal of
 activity.     In the search for such provisions, the equality of
 action and reaction, and the possibility that the compensation
 is continually furnished by Him who is ever

  things by the word of his power," seem to have been wholly
 overlooked.
      If we assume the existence of a luminiferous aether, whether
  as a reality, or as a convenient representative of coordinated
  central forces, its undulations, when obstructed by inert centres,
  would necessarily lead to such phenomena as those of gravi
  tation, light, heat, electricity, magnetism, &c. Confining our
  selves for the present to the action of gravitation, it is well
  known that the limiting velocity of possible gravitating action

    Since such is the supposed character of the solar nucleus, it
seems not    unlikely that, the centrifugal radiations of any hea
venly body -being at all times equivalent to the centripetal
radiations which it intercepts, solar and stellar light and heat
are only the reactionary consequences of such perpetual in
ternal oscillations as the aether has first transmitted to the
luminous orbs and then resumed.             The fact that the reaction
which is shown in the centrifugal force of solar rotation, and
the action which is shown in parabolic orbital velocities, find
a common limit in the velocity of light, may perhaps be re
garded as a crucial test of this hypothesis, which is further
strengthened by the following considerations.
    In the huge comet-like nebulosity which is indicated by the
 solar-stellar paraboloid, the interesting relation which has been
 pointed out by Stockwell* between the perihelia of Jupiter
 and Uranus, and the many indications of normal "subsidence

which    I have shown in previous papers, suggest the probability
 of an early ellipsoidal nucleus with subordinate nucleoli — the
 major axis of the nucleus being bounded by 2V5 (60'939) and
 2$5 (41-358), and the Sun being in the focus.                The vis viva

       It seems probable that, in consequence of subsidence, Ju
   piter, which, as we have already seen, was the centre of nucleal
   volume, may have also been the centre of nucleal mass at the
   time of its complete orbital separation, and that it was there
   fore the primitive Sun of the extra-asteroidal planets before it
  became our Sun's
                           " companion star." For with the present
   mass of the system, and with a mean radius vector = $i + V-i
   (34,4845), the orbital period of Neptune would be 73,966 days.
   Two successive subsidences (34,4845-i-n''i) would bring the
   solar nucleal surface to about § of ? 3, or 54-53 solar radii.
   The angular acceleration of rotation, due to subsequent nucleal
  contraction, would a. -2.        Therefore, when the Sun had con
  tracted to its present limits, its rotation-period would be
  73966h-54-532 = 24-88 days*.
      If  this were the only coincidence of its kind, we might per
  haps have some good grounds for looking upon it as merely
  curious and accidental ; but the bond of connexion which we
  have already found between rotation and revolution, in the
  limiting formative undulations which are propagated with the
  velocity of light, may prepare us for accepting evidences of a
  similar bond in the phenomena of nebular subsidence.
      There are three other known systems of cosmical rotation
  which may help us to judge as to the rightfulness of such an
  acceptance, viz. : — that of the extra-asteroidal planets, with an
 estimated average period of about 10 hours ; that of the intra-
 asteroidal planets, with an estimated period of about 24 hours;
 and that of the moon, with a synodic period of 29*5306 days.
  If  these periods are dependent upon the same subsidence which
 led to the early belt-formations, we may reasonably look for
 evidence of that dependence of a character similar to that
 which we have found in the case of the sun.
     We have seen that the first subsidences from 2 y and 3 n
 account for the orbital ruptures of Jupiter and Earth ; second
 ary subsidences from points within the orbital belts account
     * These relations may have an important bearing on Croll's hypothesis
 of the origin of solar radiation.   In the stellar-solar paraboloid, of which
 traces still exist between Sun and a Centauri, there must have been fre
 quent collisions.    Some of Croll's critics have shown strange misappre
 hensions as to the possible velocity of collision. The limit of possible
 relative velocity, from the simple gravitation of two equal meeting masses,
is 2>i/2gr.    This would be equivalent, taking the values of g and rat Sun's
apparent surface, to -01774 r, or more than 750 miles per second. If pro
jection were added to gravitation, or if the two masses had small solid
nuclei of great density, while the greater part of their volume was gaseous,
or if there were a large number of equal masses, the limit of possible velo
city might be largely increased.

these accordances we have additional evidence of the equality

    The normal character of rotation is still further traceable,
even after the formation      of the subordinate planets in the two
principal planetary belts.        If we seek the point of incipient
condensation which would lead to such rotation-periods as
have been generally assigned by astronomers to the different

 being immeasurably greater than the surface-charge, we
 could not hope, by any method of experimenting, to properly
 compare the true specific inductive capacity with the index
 of refraction for light of infinitely long waves ; so that, in

in melted bees'-wax, with alternate sheets of tin-foil.      After
the condenser was built up in the usual way, melted bees'-wax
was poured in, the plates squeezed together, and the whole
shut up in a fairly good water-tight wooden box. The con
denser was buried several feet under ground, to ensure uni
formity of temperature, connexion being made with the insu
lated coating by a piece of Atlantic-cable core, and with the
other coating by a piece of bare copper wire.
   After this condenser had been buried for a short time
underground, it showed the apparently abnormal condition
of diminution of resistance by electrification.      This pheno
menon then formed the subject for special investigation
with this condenser, an account of the results obtained being
given at the end of this short paper.
   As bees'-wax is one of the few substances in which the
index of refraction for light increases in passing from the
liquid to the solid state, it seemed important, in connexion
with the electromagnetic theory of light, to carefully mea
sure the specific inductive capacity of a wax condenser as
it was gradually cooled through the solidifying point.          A
small, shallow, clean copper box, 19 centims. long by 17
centims. wide, was therefore lined with a sheet of letter-paper,
0'036 centim. thick, previously well soaked in melted bees'-
wax. A clean copper disk, 12'8 centims. in diameter, was
placed on the top, weighted down, and the dish filled
up with melted wax.          This condenser, A B (fig. 1), was
heated in an oil-bath, CD.          E and F are holes for the
insertion of thermometers, of which the bulbs were just
above the wax condenser ;           G is an opening through
which the insulated electrode H of the condenser may pro
trude without touching the oil-bath.      A wooden stand, W W,
supports   the  condenser  in the middle of the bath ; and a glass
vessel V holds strong sulphuric acid to keep the inside space
artificially dry. The bath is closed by a double door, which
is made to fit well by a strip of leather inserted between it
and the bath.
   The condenser having been inserted, the bath was heated to
about 90° C., and kept at that temperature for some time ; the
lamps were then removed, when the temperature fell very

slowly. The capacity was then measured (several observations
being made at each temperature) by charging the condenser
with 75 DanielPs cells joined in series, and discharging it
through an exceedingly delicate Thomson's reflecting galva

sent the results obtained on three different days, distances
measured parallel to 0 X representing temperature, the points

and distances measured parallel to O Y representing capacity,

For the curve G H the zero-line is O X. It will be seen at
once that these curves, obtained on different days, do not give
the same capacity for the same temperature (the numbers,
therefore, that have been calculated for the specific inductive
capacity are not given) ; but considering, first, the very small
capacities that had to be measured, and, secondly, the difficulty
of accurately determining the temperature of a non-heat-
conductor like wax, even when enclosed in the oil-bath, the
discrepancies in the curves are not to be wondered at. One
fact, however, is very striking in all the three curves ; and that
is the rise in capacity as the temperature very slowly falls
from about 80° to 00° C., and the subsequent diminution in
the capacity on a still further diminution of the temperature.
Probably, had experiments on capacity been made when cooling
from a much higher temperature, there would have been
observed, first, a gradual diminution in capacity due to cooling
down to about 80° C. (traces of this first diminution are seen
in the portion A B of the curve A B C D); then we have the
rise of capacity as the wax solidifies at about 60°C.; and,
lastly, we see the subsequent rapid decrease on further cooling.
Now this is precisely in agreement with the changes known
to occur in the index of refraction for light ; and hence the
interest of these experimeuts.
    As there was always a small electromotive force in the wax
condenser, and as the vibrations of the galvanometer-needle
were, as usual, damped by the air-vane,           I used for calculating
the capacity the formula developed               by Prof. Perry and
myself for employment in such cases*, which is

where Q is the quantity of electricity discharged through the
galvanometer, H the horizontal intensity of the galvanometer-
field, l the half length of the needle, G the galvanometer-
constant, P the periodic time of vibration, L the logarithmic
decrement, ^ the first sudden swing on discharge, xr the
deflection that would be produced by the small constant
current, and which is equal to
where xa is the second swing and D the decrement.
   It might, of course, be at once objected that the rise in
capacity as the wax cools from about 80° to 60° C. is perhaps
not due to any change in the specific inductive capacity, but
merely indicates that the distance between the copper plate of
the condenser was slightly diminished by the wax shrinking
on solidifying.    This solution, however, is improbable, since,
although a sudden expansion of the wax on solidifying (if
such an expansion existed) might have separated the plates,
it is unlikely that the contraction which really occurred
could have brought them nearer together than the thickness
of the paper by which they were separated when the wax
was liquid.      Nevertheless, partly to obtain additional evi
dence on this point, and partly to measure the specific
resistance (or resistance per cubic centimetre) of bees'-wax
at different temperatures,    I made ten distinct sets of expe
riments, occupying many days, on the conductivity of wax.
In these experiments the wax condenser was heated up to
about 130° 0., and a current sent through it with the 75
Daniell's cells in series.   The temperature was kept constant
at about 130° C. until the galvanometer-deflection had reached
its maximum, when it was considered that the wax had ac
quired the temperature indicated by the thermometer. The
temperature was then allowed to fall very slowly, and fre
quent readings of the galvanometer and thermometer were
taken.    The results obtained are shown on fig. 3, temperature
being   measured   parallel to O X, the points 0 and X corre
sponding    with  30° and 130° C.; distances measured parallel
to O Y represent conductivity on such a scale that for the
curve L M, representing the conductivity between 115° and
65° C., O S corresponds with a resistance of 67,735 megohms
per cubic centimetre ; and for the curves N P, Q R (which
are drawn on a larger scale) the distance O T represents a
resistance of 186,000 megohms, —the zero-line for conductivity
for all three curves being O X. The point P, corresponding
to a resistance of 37,000,000 megohms per cubic centimetre,

136           Prof. W. E. Ayrton    on the Electrical
represents the lowest conductivity    I was able to measure with
certainty directly with the galvanometer.        It may here be
mentioned that such high resistances could be measured with
the galvanometer, since one Daniell's cell, through a resistance
of 600 megohms, gave 130 scale-divisions deflection on a scale
about 1£ metre distant. The various curves obtained for con
ductivity between 115° and 65° C. agree so closely that they
may all be represented by the one curve L M. The curves for
the conductivity between 80° and 40° C. are all quite regular,
but not all of exactly the same slope, the difference depending
on the highest temperature to which the wax was heated before
 cooling on the particular day of experimenting, this being
 sometimes about 130° C. and at other times about 90° G.        All
 the curves, however, agree so closely that they are all contained
 between the two limiting curves N P and Q R shown in fig. 3.
 In no curve was there the slightest appearance of a rise of con
 ductivity at the melting-point, which would probably have
 been obtained had the copper plates approached one another
 an appreciable distance on the wax solidifying.
    We may therefore conclude that in the previous experiments
 the rise in the capacity at melting indicates a true increase in
 the specific inductive capacity coincident with an increase in
 the index of refraction for light.
    As regards apparent increase of resistance by electrification,
 which, as mentioned,    I observed during repeated experiments,
 extending over some months, with the wax condenser buried
 underground, the general conclusions arrived at were that
 not only did the conductivity usually increase by electrification,
 but that it steadily increased day by day — a result indicating
 that the wax was deteriorating, probably from damp penetrating
 through the joints of the wooden box in spite of leather having
 been inserted between the different parts of the wood before
 they were screwed together. This conclusion appeared to be
 correct, since, on digging up the condenser and keeping it
 near a fire for many days, it regained its original high
 resistance.   The damp must therefore not only have entered
 through the joints in the wood, but through some small cracks
  that were observed in the mass of wax when the condenser
 was opened ; and it was probably due to this damp that the
 peculiar effects of polarization were observed similar to those
 noticed by the Comte du Moncel when testing stones, and by
  Mr. T. Warren in certain insulating oils.
    I  now made a number of experiments with lead chloride as
 a dielectric — a substance to which my attention was
                                                         especially
 drawn by some remarks of M. Buff in Ann. Chem. Pharm. ex.
 p. 258 (1859), in which he says that this substance conducts

electricity like a metal (that       without decomposition) — a
                                    is,
conclusion, however, which at first sight would appear to be
negatived by certain experiments of M. Wiedemann published
in Pogg. Ann. cliv. 318-320, from which he found that the
resistance of lead chloride diminished by increase of tempe
rature.
 I    first had made    small carbon box containing
                            a                              carbon
                                                           a
plate, but prevented from touching        by throe small pieces of
                                          it
clean glass.    The carbon plate had carbon electrode attached
                                          a
 toit,  the whole being cut out of   asolid piece of carbon so as
 to have the shape of an inverted T.    Into the box lead chloride
was poured in      fused state
                   a           until  itcovered up the plate, but
 leaving the carbon electrode of the plate protruding for con
nexion with the battery.      The whole was then allowed to cool
very slowly.     The  outer part of the carbon box and the end
 of the carbon electrode were now electrotyped, and copper
 wires soldered on; the junctions of the carbon and copper being
 quite clear of the lead chloride.
    With this condenser the results given on the next page wore
observed.
   In addition to the resistance of the condenser being mea
sured while the battery was connected, time-readings were
also taken with the galvanometer of the discharge from the
condenser after the removal of the battery, as well as time-
readings with an electrometer of the electromotive force in
the condenser producing the discharge.           As, however, the
diminution in the discharge-deflection was in each case quite
regular, the curves are not given.
    It    interesting to observe in the Table (p. 138) that in
         is
every case there       diminution of resistance by electrification,
                       is

although in some cases there was an increase during the first
minute. Looking at the first group of tests, taken between
November 13th and 15th, we see            agradual increase in the
resistance day by day.       Looking also at the second group
made between November 21st and December 1st, we likewise
see a  steady daily increase in the resistance    but in the interval
                                                    ;
 between November 15th and 21st, when no tests were made,
there appears to be      decided diminution in resistance.

 the beginning, and on December 1st, at the end of the inves
 tigation, give almost identical results,      cannot be concluded
                                               it
 with certainty that there was any decided deterioration taking
 place in the lead chloride.    But on breaking up the condenser,
 the lead chloride was found to contain many small holes       ;   so
 that    it  possible that damp may have collected in these.

improbable ; since the condenser, both when being tested and
when not tested, was kept in an atmosphere kept partially dry
with sulphuric acid.
    Some fresh lead chloride was prepared in the same way as
before — that      is,
                    by precipitating from solution of lead acetate
                                             a
with    a solution of common salt, and carefully washing the
precipitate several times with distilled water. But the new
condenser, made with the carbon box and plate, was found to
have    aresistance of only two megohms at 16° C.j und, unlike
what was experienced in the former case, the resistance in all
the experiments was now found to increase by electrifications.
This, however,        probably explained by the fact that, whereas
                     is
in the previous case thirty volts electromotive force was used,
now only one volt was employed           ;   so that decomposition
(whether of the lead chloride itself, or of the damp which after
decomposition may act on the chloride) was probably not pro
duced.     Some preliminary temperature-tests were now made;
and,  in   accordance    with Wiedemann's results,     I  found that
the resistance diminished with elevation of temperature.
   The condenser was now left in an atmosphere dried with
sulphuric acid from December 21st to January 7th, when               it
was found that the resistance had increased to about 15'6
megohms at 7(P C. A large number of measurements of the
conductivity at different temperatures, using the same oil-bath
for raising the temperature as      is  shown in fig.      were now
                                                           1,
made.      The different experiments gave results so nearly
agreeing that they may all be represented by the curve STV
(fig. 4), in which distances parallel to     O  X represent tempe
rature, the points        and X corresponding to the tempera
                          O
tures 0° and 100° C. respectively        ; and distances parallel to
O   Y represent conductivity     on  sucha  scale that the point     T,
corresponding to a temperature of 70° C., represents            a  re
sistance of about 15'6 megohms.         The curve      approximately
                                                      is
logarithmic    ; that       the ratio of the difference of the
                             is,
logarithms    of the  conductivities  to the difference of tempera
tures   isapproximately constant.
   Thinking that possibly the method previously employed for
making the lead chloride, by precipitating       it from a solution of
lead  acetate   with    solution
                         a       of  common    salt, may have intro
duced traces of some salt of lead other than the chloride, the
following method was now employed for making another
supply of the chloride.       From clear solution of lead nitrate
                                   a
a  precipitate   was   formed   with colourless hydrochloric acid,
and the precipitate well washed with distilled water. A third
condenser was now constructed, three small pieces of glass
0'225 centimetre thick being used to separate the carbon

 140           Prof. W. E. Ayrton on     the Electrical
 plate from the box.     The connexions with the box and plate
 were made as before, by first electrotyping the carbon with
 copper and then soldering on copper wires, the junctions of
 the carbon and copper not being in contact with the lead
 chloride. A condenser was also made with a copper box and
 a copper plate, the two being well coated with graphite to
protect them from the action of the lead chloride, and separated
 from one another by three small pieces of glass O135 centi
 metre in thickness.
    Tests of conductivity were now made at different tempera
tures with both condensers, 0'075 volt being employed with
 the carbon and 7-5 volts with the copper condenser, or some
times 2'2 volts with the latter.     With the carbon condenser
 and with the smaller electromotive force the resistance was
 found to increase with electrification, whereas with the copper
 condenser and with the electromotive force 2"2 volts the re
 sistance diminished with electrification, and with 7'5 volts this
diminution became much more rapid, these results being
 observed at both high and low temperatures.         In the earlier
experiments with this copper condenser the diminution was
regular, whereas later on it proceeded irregularly ; but on the
whole it may be said that when an electromotive force not
exceeding    if  volt was employed there was an increase in
resistance by electrification, such as is usually experienced with
gutta-percha and with ordinary dielectrics, while when the
electromotive force exceeded this limit there was either a
regular or an irregular diminution of resistance by electrifi
cation — the results apparently not depending much on whether
carbon or copper coated with graphite was used for the plates
of the condenser.
    As this limiting electromotive force appears to be about the
same as that necessary to decompose water, I think we may
fairly conclude that the diminution in resistance is due to a
decomposition of the damp (which appears to be contained in
the lead chloride even when careful means are taken to dry
it), and to the products of the decomposition acting on the
chloride.    Fig. 5 shows four electrification-curves, A A A,
B B B, C C C, D D D, obtained from four successive experiments
with the carbon box, and corresponding with the temperatures
15° C., 57° C., 14° C., 61° C. respectively.      Time is measured
parallel to   0 X,  the  points 0  and   X   corresponding to the
moment of applying the battery, and to 50 minutes after
wards ; conductivity is measured parallel to 0 Y from the line
0 X of zero conductivity. The curves BBB and C C C, for
57° C. and 61°C., are drawn on a vertical scale five times
smaller than that employed for A A A and C C C — the scale for

             Properties of Bees '-wa.v aitd Lead Chloride.         141
time, however, remaining the same. All the tests from which
these curves are drawn were made with 0'075 volt electro
motive force. The curves a a a, b b b, ccc, fig. 6, are the dis
charge-curves obtained in the three above experiments for
15° 0., 57° 0., and 14° C., observations of the discharge in the
experiment for 61° C. not having been taken. The scale both
for conductivity and for time is the same exactly as that
employed in the curves A A A, CCC, fig. 5. All the curves
show a regular increase of resistance with electrification, the
increase being far more rapid at a high than at a low tempe
rature. As was seen from the curve S T U, fig. 4, so also from
fig. 6 we learn that the conductivity is much greater at a high
 than at a low temperature ; and we also see from the curves
A A A, B B B, C C C, D D D, that the general eflect of testing
day by day appears to lower the conductivity.
    Electrification-curves E E E, F F F, G G G, H H H, fig. 7,
 were obtained from four successive tests with the copper-box
 condenser, and correspond with the temperatures 15°C., 60° C.,
 13° C., 61° C. respectively. Time is measured parallel to O X,
 the points O and X corresponding to the moment of apply
 ing the battery ; and 50 minutes afterwards conductivity is
 measured parallel to O Y from a zero as far below O X as the
 point Y is above.       Curve F F F is on a scale for vertical
•distances one twentieth of that employed for the curves E E E
 G G G, and H H H on a scale one fifth of that used with
 E E E, G G G : that is to say, if the same scale were employed
 for vertical distances for all four curves, the two for the higher
 temperatures would be far above those for the lower tempera
 tures — in fact, would be off the paper altogether.      For hori
 zontal distances (that          is,
                              for time) the same scale    employed
                                                         is
 for all the curves. An electromotive force of 7'5 volts was
 employed with all the experiments from which these four
 curves were drawn.       Although the curves are irregular, still,
 on the whole, there     an increase of conductivity or diminution
                            is
 of resistance with electrification    and that this
                                       ;            is probably due
 to the chemical action of the current referred to above     shown
                                                              is
 from the irregularity of the discharge- curve ggg obtained
 after removing the battery in the test at 15° C. Curve hhh,
 however, which        the discharge-curve for the test at 61° C.,
                       is
 does not show any such irregularity
           .                               ;  but then   itmust be
 noticed that H H       S,the charge-curve for this temperature,
 indicates on the whole rather an increase than a diminution
 of resistance by electrification.

      XIX.   Theory   of Voltaic Action.    By   J.   BROWN, Esq.*
          production of a difference of electric potential by vol
TIHEtaic    action is attributed by some primarily to the differ
ence of chemical attraction between the two elements of a
voltaic couple for one of the components (ions) of some com
pound body (electrolyte) in contact with both, that element
which has the greater affinity being the positive one.          It is
said by others to be due to the simple
                                             " contact " of the two
elements without the intervention of any third substance or
combination, and has been attributed, in the case of two metals
such as copper and zinc, to their mutual chemical attractionf.
Faraday could not, however, discover any current during the
combination of two metals (tin and platinum), through great
heat was evolved J ; and he considered that though the source
of energy in a voltaic pair was the combination of the active
ion with the positive plate, decomposition was necessary to its
development in the form of electricity.        Numerous old expe
riments may     be  cited which show  how   in various ways altera
tions in the electric relations of metals in voltaic pairs may be
produced without altering their contact.
    The following experiments seem to go far towards establish
ing the truth of the first-mentioned (chemical) theory.
      If
       a potential series (A) be formed by immersing couples of
various metals &c. in an oxidizing electrolyte and testing for
the current generated, and another (B) by the use of condenser-
 plates in the usual way adopted by contact theorists, the two
series will be found curiously similar.    The simplest conclusion
                                     " contact " excitement is due
 appears to be that the so-called
 to the presence of a gaseous film § containing water, carbon
 dioxide, or other oxygen compounds between the plates, which
 film may be considered as having all the properties of an oxi
 dizing electrolyte except its conductivity.
      Ifin forming series A we use an electrolyte containing
 some other active ion such as sulphur, we obtain a totally dif
 ferent series, which, as Professor Fleeming Jenkin remarks               ||,
is  " quite anomalous and inconsistent with the
                                                      simple poten
tial theory."      But   ifthe chemical theory be true, then in
 forming series    B, ifwe substitute for the ordinary atmosphere,
 containing watery vapour and other oxygen compounds, an

         Mr.  J.  Brown on    the Theory of Voltaic Action.      143
atmosphere     containing a suitable sulphur compound, the ano
maly should disappear, and we should obtain effects with the
condenser which would place the metals in the same potential
order as when immersed in sulphur electrolytes.          In order to
verify this the following experiment was made.         Starting with
the fact that iron is positive to copper in an oxidizing electrolyte
(as water), while copper is positive to iron in a solution contain
ing potassium sulphide or other similar sulphur compound,          I
made a condenser with disks 4J inches in diameter, one of
copper, the other iron, well ground together. The iron disk was
screwed on the lower end of an iron rod sliding in a brass tube
fixed with shellac in a wooden cover fastened on the neck of a
gas-jar. The jar stood on a wooden stand, through the middle
of which rose a similar insulated rod carrying the copper disk.
Means were provided for adjusting the disks parallel to one
another, and also for filling the jar which enclosed both disks
with any required gas.
    To measure the charge excited by the "contact" of the
plates a quadrant-electrometer was employed, which gave a
deflection of 5 millims. for the potential of a bichromate cell.
When the condenser-plates were placed together (in ordinary
atmosphere) connected with opposite pairs of quadrants and
then separated, the index light moved over 1 centim., the iron
being positive, as was to be expected.          Hydrogen sulphide
 was then allowed to flow into the gas-jar ; and on repeating
the connexion and separation of the plates the iron proved to
be negative, the iight-spot moving over about 3 centims. in
 the direction opposite to its first motion.     This was repeated
 several times ; and on examining the plates after the experi
 ment, the copper was found to be of a deep blue colour, while the
 iron was scarcely altered. It will be observed here that the
  only alteration in the circumstances of the experiment was the
 change in the atmosphere surrounding the plates.           The con
 tacts all remained    the  same  ; and when  the  atmosphere con
 tained a sulphur compound, the plates      assumed   the same elec
 tric relation as they would in an electrolyte containing a
 sulphur compound.         Even the proportionate degree of tension
 between   the  plates  in air and in hydrogen sulphide is similar
 to the ratio of their electromotive force in water and in potas
 sium sulphide solution.
    The next experiment appears to confirm in a marked way
 the view that the difference of potential between two metals
 in contact is due principally, if not altogether, to the difference
 of their affinities for one of the elements of some compound
 gas in the atmosphere surrounding them.          The experiment is
 a modification    of  one  devised  by Sir William   Thomson, and

             "A   metal bar insulated so as to be movable about
an axis peqiendicular to the plane of a metal ring made up
half of copper and half of zinc, the two halves being soldered
together, turns from the zinc towards the copper when vi-
treously electrified, and from the copper towards the zinc when

a copper and iron one, C      I, 3'1 inches
diameter outside, with a 1 inch hole in
centre.     It was supported on a tripod
inside a case with plate-glass sides, and
which could be connected by rubber
tubing with an apparatus for genera
ting hydrogen sulphide. A piece of
lead-paper was placed inside the case
to detect the first entrance of the gas.
From the top of the case rose a ver
tical glass tube with a torsion head,
from which depended a platinum wire
 -0025 in. in diameter and about 19 in.
long, carrying the needle or bar, n, of
thin sheet aluminium, 1^ in. long by
-A in. wide, a mirror M of about 4 ft.
focus, and a glass weight, W, which
dipped in a vessel of water to steady
it.     The tripod carrying the ring
 rested on the points of three screws
passing up through the bottom of the
case, by means of which the piano of
the ring could be adjusted so as to get
equal deflections on each side of the
 zero-line.    The needle hung at a distance of 1 or 2 millims.
above the ring, as nearly as possible over the junction of the
 metals, and having its suspension-wire in the centre of the
 ring. It was electrified by connecting it with the positive
 or negative conductor of a Winter's plate machine.
    In a preliminary experiment with a copper-zinc ring, de
 flections of 5 centims. on each side of zero on the scale were
 readily obtained. With the copper-iron ring, however, the
 deflections were only £ to 1 centim.. the iron being as zinc to
 the copper. As the potential of the needle could not be main
 tained constant by the means employed, the deflection was
 continually varying in amount; but when the machine was
 carefully worked these variations were slight, and did not in
 terfere with the result. What follows is from my notes of the
 third time of going over the experiment.         The needle being

iron, the case was connected with the hydrogen-sulphide bottle,
and sulphuric acid poured in to generate the gas.                  At 2^
minutes afterwards the lead-paper began to darken at edge ;
and in half a minute more the needle crossed the zero-line and
turned towards the copper half of ring — deflection about

to negative it turned towards copper ; and so on, till in about
10 minutes after admitting the gas the deflections became un
decided, the copper having become covered with sulphide,
which has no affinity for sulphur.

 TN      this volume Professor Smyth has given his attention to a most
 -*-
        important feature of Sidereal Astronomy, viz.
                                                          " Stellar Proper
 Motions." At present we know but little either of the distribution
 of the stars in space or of the directions in which they are moving.
 Proctor has shown that groups of stars separated, as seen by the
 unassisted eye, many degrees from each other, possess a community
 of motion, the logical inference being that they are in some way
 connected.       The spectroscope reveals to us the fact that many stars
 are receding from us in the line of sight, and that others are ap
 proaching us in the same line.          Proctor's deduction of " Star
 Drift" is based, if we mistake not, on the Proper Motions as given
 in various catalogues which he found necessary to study in con
  structing his star-maps ; but neither the present recorded Proper
 Motions nor the recorded motions in the line of sight give us any
  information as yet as to the distribution of the stars in space ; and
  if Professor Smyth's suggestion be carried out, of filling up the
  lacunae purposely left in his catalogue for the reception of obser
  vations of B. A. and N.P.D. from other sources to which he has not
  had access, it is extremely probable that many corrections may be
  made to the numerical values of Proper Motions now on record.
  Whether the Astronomer Royal for Scotland has succeeded in truly
  correcting the values on record or not, he has at all events drawn
  the attention of astronomers to the subject, and that in a way which
   cannot fail of contributing to its advancement.
      It is considered, by astronomers competent to give expression to

 a sound judgment, that the best determination of Proper Motions
 which we possess are by Mr. Stone ; they are contained in vol. sxxiii.
 of the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, and are derived
 from a comparison of Bradley's observations with the Greenwich
 seven-year Catalogue for I860, giving an interval of 105 years, on
 which the determinations rest.
      It is greatly to be desired that the Proper Motions of the Star*,
 as now recorded in various catalogues, should be most scrupulously
 examined, Stone's determination being taken as the basis. Among
 the stars we have a remarkable class, viz. those having larije Proper
  Motions. Professor Newcomb, in his ' Popular Astronomy,' refers
 to the star 1830 Groombridge as the most remarkable of them, its
  Proper Motion being more than seven seconds of arc per annum,
  which, combined with its parallax, gives a real motion of two hundred
 miles in a second of time. There are two stars said to have a
 greater Proper Motion than this star, viz. 2151 Navis, whoso
 Proper Motion is 7"'9 per annum, and e Indi, 7"'7. By giving
 close and unremitting attention to these stars, light may be thrown
 on the question as to whether they are members of a group passing
 through our sidereal system with immense velocity.          If Professor
 Smyth's Catalogue contributes in any degree to elucidate our know
 ledge of stellar Proper Motions on a great scale in our sidereal
 system, he has not done his work in vain.         We greatly approve of
 the plan he has adopted of leaving spaces for the insertion of ob
 servations from other sources, also of devoting a page to each star;
and we shall look with great interest for the appearance of the next
four hours of the Catalogue.

             " On the Glacial Phenomena of the Long Island, or Outer
 Hebrides." 2nd paper. Hy James Oeikie, Esq., LL.D.,F.K.S., F.G.S.
     In this paper the author gave some additional notes on the
 glaciation of Lewis, and a detailed account of the glacial
 phenomena of Harris and tho other islands that form the
 southern portion of the Outer Hebrides.        Additional evidence was
 adduced to show that Lewis has been glaciated from S.E. to N.W.;
and the shelly boulder-clays and interglacial shell-beds of that part
of tho Long Island were described in detail.         Harris, North L'ist,
Benbecula, South Uist, Barra, and the other islands that go to form
the chain of the " Long Island " were successively described under the
headings of Physical features. Geological structure, Glaciation, Till or

 Glacial Phenomena of the Long Island or Outer Hebrides.             147
 Boulder- clay, Erratics and perched blocks, Morainic debris and Mo
 raines, Freshwater lakes and Sea-lochs. Numerous bearings of stria,
which abound, were given ; and these were held to prove that the whole
Outer Hebrides have been glaciated by ice that flowed outwards from
the mainland of Scotland. The position of abundant roches moutonnta
points to the same conclusion ; and this is still further supported by
the " travel " of the Till. That deposit is generally absent or very
sparingly present on the rock-faces that look towards the mainland ;
but it is heaped up in their rear, and spreads over the lower tracts
that slope gently towards the Atlantic. On the west side of the
islands not a few boulders occur in the Till which have been derived
from the east ; and the same is true of certain erratics lying loose
at the surface of the ground.     The islands are well glaciated up to
a height of 1600 feet above the sea; and the line of demarcation
between the glaciated and non-glaciated areas is extremely pro
nounced. Above 1600 feet the hills show rugged, splintered, jagged,
and sometimes serrate tops.     The author regarded the Till or boulder-
clay as the morainic material that gathered underneath the ice; and
proof of this is given. Erratics and perched blocks are very numerous ;
and most of these, as well as much of the morainic debris, are believed
to have been dropped where we now find them during the final melting
of the ice-sheet. It was shown, however, that certain erratics and
perched blocks and some well-marked moraines are due to local
glaciers, as are also some of the striations in a few of the mountain-
valleys.    The origin of the rook-basins which are now lakes was dis
cussed, and attributed to the erosive action of ice.       To the same
cause were assigned the rock-basins which occur in certain of the
sea-lochs.
    In concluding, the author pointed out that we may now arrive at
a true    estimate of the thickness attained by Ihe ice-sheet in the
north-west of Scotland.     If a line be drawn from the upper limits
of the glaciations in Kosshire (3000 feet) to a height of 1600 feet in
the Long Island, we have an incline of only 1 in 210 for the upper
surface of the ice-sheet ; and of course we are able to say what
thickness the ice reached in the Minch.     Between the mainland and
the Outer Hebrides it was as much as 3800 feet.        No boulders de
rived from Skye or the mainland occur in the Till of the Outer
Hebrides ; and this was explained by the deflection of the lower portion
of the ice-sheet against the steep wall of rock that faces the Minch.
The underpart of the ice that flowed across the Minch would be
deflected to right and left against the inner margin of the Long
Island; and the deep rock-basins that exist all along that margin
are believed to have been scooped out by the grinding action of the
deflected ice.    Towards the north of Lewis, where the land shelves
off gently into the sea, the under strata of the ice-sheet were enabled
to creep up and over the district of Ness, and thus gave rise to the
lower shelly boulder-clay of that neighbourhood, which contains
boulders derived from the mainland.       The presence of the overlying
interglacial shell-beds proves a subsequent melting of the ice-sheet,

and a depression of the land for at least 200 feet.        The overlying
shelly boulder-clay   shows  that the  ice-sheet returned  and overflowed
Lewis, scooping out the older drift-beds and commingling them with
its bottom moraine. The absence of kames was commented upon,
•and shown to be inexplicable on the assumption that such deposits are
 of marine origin, whilst if they be of torrential origin their absence
is only what might be expected from the physical features of the
islands.   The only traces of Postglacial submergence are met with
 at merely a few feet above present high-water mark.
    2. " Cataclysmic Theories of Geological Climate." By James
Croll, Esq., LL.D., F.R.8.     Communicated by Prof. Ramsay, LL.D.,
F.K.S., F.G.8.
    The author commenced by calling attention to the great diversity
of the hypotheses which have been brought forward for the explana
tion of those changes in the climate of the same regions of the earth's
surface which are revealed by geological investigations — such as alte
rations of the relative distribution of sea and land, of the ecliptic,
and of the position of the earth's axis of rotation — all of which, he
 maintained, have proved insufficient or untenable.          Sir William
Thomson has lately maintained that an increase in the amount of
heat conveyed by ocean-currents, combined with the effects of clouds,
 winds, and aqueous vapour, is sufficient to account for the former
prevalence of temperate climates in the Arctic regions ; and this view,
the author stated, he had himself been contending for for more than
twelve years.     He thinks, however, that alterations in the eccen
tricity of the earth's orbit is the primary motive cause, whilst Sir
William Thomson believes this to be the submergence of circum-
polar lands, which, however, in Miocene times, appear to have been
more extensive than at present.     He pointed out that a preponderance
of equatorial land, as assumed by Sir Charles Lyell to account for
the milder climate of Arctic regions in Miocene times, would rather
tend to loss of heat by rapid radiation into space, whilst water is re
markably powerful as a transporter of heat ; so that, in this case,
equatorial water rather than equatorial land is needed.
    In speaking of the glacial climate, the author maintained that
local causes are insufficient to explain so extensive a phenomenon.
He indicated that we are only too prone to seek for great or cata
clysmic causes ; and although this tendency has disappeared from many
fields of geological research, this is not the case in all. His explana
tion of the causes of a mild climate in high northern latitudes is as
follows : — Great eccentricity of the earth's orbit, winter in perihelion,
the blowing of the south-east trades across the equator perhaps as far
as the tropic of Cancer, and impulsion of all the great equatorial
currents into northern latitudes ; on the other hand, when, with
great eccentricity, the winter is in aphelion, the whole condition of
things is reversed : the north-east trades blow over into the southern
hemisphere, carrying with them the great equatorial currents, and
glacial conditions prevail in the northern hemisphere. Thus those
warm and cold periods which have prevailed during past geological

    On Serpentine   and. associated Igneous Rocks of Ayrshire.       149
 ages   are regarded by the     author   as great secular summers     and
winters.
    3. " On the Distribution of Ice
                                       during the Glacial Period."     By
 T. F. Jamieson, Esq., F.G.8.
    The author believes that a study of the distribution of ice during
the Glacial period proves that the greatest accumulations of snow
took place in precisely those districts which are now characterized
by a very heavy rainfall ; and he pointed out how exactly this is in
 accordance with the views of Prof. Tyndall as to the conditions most
 favourable to the development of glaciers. In support of this con
 clusion he reviewed the phenomena presented by the most highly
glaciated districts of the British Islands, of Scandinavia, and Europe
generally, and of Asia and North America. and contended that in
every case his opinion is borne out, the districts which are now re
markable for an excessive rainfall having been formerly centres of
 dispersion for great systems of glaciers. The notion of a polar ice
 cap he held to be opposed to many well-known        facts ; and he dis
 cussed the distribution of various forms of life during and since the
 Glacial epoch, with the object of determining whether the drainage
 of ice from the great polar basin was effected by means of the de
 pression of Davis's Straits or of Behring's Straits.       The evidence
 appeared to him to be in favour of the former channel.

    The following communications were read : —
    1. " On the Serpentine and associated Igneous Rocks of the
 Ayrshire Coast." By Prof. T. G. Bonney, M.A., F.G.S., Professor
 of Geology at University College, London, and Fellow of St. John's
 College, Cambridge.
    In a paper published Q. J. G. 8. xxii. p. 513, Mr. J. Geikio states
that the rocks of this district are of sedimentary origin, a felspar-
porphyry being the "maximum stage of metamorphosis exhibited by
the felspathio rocks," and the diorito, hypersthenite, and serpentine
beingall the result of metamorphism of bedded rocks. This view is also
asserted in the catalogue of the rocks collected by the Geological
Survey of Scotland.     The author had seen specimens of rocks from
this district which so closely resembled some from the Lizard, that
he visited the Ayrshire coast in the summer of 1877.         The conclu
sions formed in the field have since been tested by microscopic exam
ination.    He finds that several, at least, of the group of " dioritic "
rocks are of igneous origin, and are dolerite and basalt, since they
contain augite, not hornblende.      The serpentine is undoubtedly an
intrusive rock, the evidence being abundant and remarkably clear.
One specimen can hardly be distinguished at sight from the black
serpentine of Cadwith (Lizard) ; the resemblance also is most stri
king when the rock is examined chemically and microscopically.
Examination of different varieties shows the serpentine to be, like
that of Cornwall, an altered olivine-enstatitc rock. The rock called

 nypersthenite is also intrusive.   The author found no hypersthenc.
 There are two varieties : — one a remarkable rock, consisting mainly
 of large crystals of diallage, a gabbro extremely rich in this mineral
 and almost free from felspar ; and a gabbro of later date, much re
 sembling the ordinary gabbro of the Lizard, the felspar being con
 verted into a kind of saussurite, and some of the diallage into horn
 blende. The " felspar-porphyries

                                         appeared to the author in the
 field to present all the characters of true igneous rock, to be asso
 ciated with tuffs, and to be unconformuble with the above-described
 group of rocks.    Microscopic examination placed their igneous cha
 racter beyond doubt. There arc also some basalt dykes of later date
 than the above.     The author is accordingly of opinion that the prin
 cipal conclusions of the paper referred to above are not warranted
 by either stratigraphical or lithological evidence.    He considers it
 probable that the " felspar-porphyry,"       like so much of that in
 Scotland, is of Old-Red-Sandstone age, and that the serpentine is of
 later date, but Palaeozoic.
    2.  "On the Metamorphic and overlying Rocks in the neighbour
 hood   of Loch Maree, Ross-shire."     By Henry Hicks, M.D., E.G.S.
    The rocks in the neighbourhood of Loch Maree have been described
 by various authors. but chiefly and most recently in papers commu
 nicated to the Geological Society by Prof. Nicol, of Aberdeen, and
 by Sir R. Murchison and Prof. Geikie, of Edinburgh.         The views
 held by these authors in regard to the order of superposition of the
 rocks are well known to be greatly at variance, not only as regards
 some of the minor subdivisions, but in relation to the actual age of
 nearly the whole of the rocks to the east, or those forming the Cen
 tral Highlands.      The older geologists and, more recently, Prof.
 Nicol hold the view that the Central Highlands consist almost en
 tirely of the old fundamental (pro-Cambrian i gneiss, or rocks of that
 age ; whilst others, represented by the late Sir R. Murchison and by
 Prof. Geikie, say that the rocks forming the whole of the Central
 Highlands are of much later date, and for the most part of Silurian
 age.    In the present communication the author endeavours to show,
from results obtained by him recently by a careful examination of
 a section extending from Loch Maree to Ben Fyn, near Auchnasheen,
that the interpretations previously given are in some important
points incorrect, and that this has been to a great extent the cause
of such very diverse opinions.
    The section described by him runs for some miles along the north
shores of Loch Maree, is then continued in a S.E. direction along the
heights opposite Kilroehcwe and across (ilyn Laggan, and then in an
easterly direction through the heights on the north of Glyn Docherty
to Ben Fyn and the range of mountains to the north of Auchna-
sheen.
    On the western and for some distance along the north shores of
Loch Maree the Lowisinn rocks (fundamental-gneiss series) are seen
to consist chiefly of reddish or greyish gneiss and hornblende- and
mica-schists.    The strike in these beds is more or less continuous

   On the Metamorphic and overlying Rocks         of Loch Jtfaree.   151
from N.W. to S.E., varying occasionally to N. and S. ; and they dip
generally at a high angle and are much contorted. Resting un con
formably upon this gneiss series, and forming here the upper part of
the mountain Slioch (about 4000 feet high), are the Cambrian con
glomerates and sandstones, made up chiefly of masses of the rocks
below cemented together by a comparatively unaltered matrix. In
this, however, he found masses of other rocks, very similar to those
found in the Cambrians of Wales, and which he thinks must have
come from beds of an intermediate age (like the Pebidian series in
Wales), which have either been completely denuded off here, or
must be present in some other area not far distant.                These
beds are, for the most part, nearly horizontal ; but on the east side
they dip slightly to the S.E., where they are succeeded unconformably
by the quartzitcs of Crag Roy.       (These quartz rocks are also beau
tifully exhibited on Ben Eay, to the south of Loch Maree, and rest
ing unconformably on the Cambrian rocks of the magnificent Torridon
Mountains.)     Alternating with these rocks are some of the so-called
fucoidal bands, the beds all dipping with a considerable inclination
to the 8.E. Upon the quartzites are seen the Limestone bands,
occupying chiefly the sloping ground on the west side of Glyn Laggan.
These are penetrated by a great mass of granitic rock, which produces
here considerable contact-alteration,      the limestone, however, at
some distance from the mass being in a comparatively unaltered
state.   In all sections across Glyn Laggan hitherto described the
mass of intrusive rock is made to penetrate along the bedding, and
is supposed to separate the Limestone entirely from the upper series
of rocks, the so-called Upper Gneiss, &c. The author, however, found
another series of sandstones, calcareous grits, and blue flags beyond the
main intrusive mass, and occupying a considerable portion of the gra
dually descending ground between the river and the heights on each side.
These were also penetrated by another arm of the granite, hut, as in
the case of the limestone, with the sole result of altering them near
the junction. Prof. Nicol places a fault at this point, and says that
the fundamental gneiss is here brought up to give an appearance of
overlying conformably the unaltered series.        The author, however,
holds, with Sir R. Murchison and Mr. Geikie, that the next is a
younger series, and that it truly overlies the unaltered beds ; but he
entirely demurs to the view held by them that these should in any
way be called gneiss rocks, or associated in any way with beds
which have undergone the metamorphic change so characteristic of
the pre-Cambrian rocks as known in this country, and which could
only be induced, he believes, by great depression combined with
heat, moisture, and pressure.     On examination he found these upper
beds everywhere unaltered, except near dykes ; and the change there
induced in them was that now well known as contact-alteration,
 and which is so entirely distinct from true metamorphisra.        These
beds all dip to the S.E., and attain a thickness of several thousand
 feet.  They are flag-like in character, are made up chiefly of
 fragmentary materials, and are occasionally even slightly calcareous.

152                     Geological  Society: — -
They are much like some of the Lower Silurian flags in Wales, and
are in no degree more highly altered than the majority of those
rocks, especially in the more disturbed districts. About three miles to
the east of Glyn Laggan these beds die out, or at least are lost, and
the Lewisian rocks, fundamental gneiss, hornblende-schists, and
mica-schists, such as those described on the east of Loch Maree,
again come to the surface ; and the whole of the remainder of the
section consists of these last rocks, the great mountains Ben Fyn,
Mulart, and others being entirely made up of these rocks without a
vestige of the unaltered beds reappearing there.         Of the gneiss,
hornblende-schists, and mica-schists which compose these moun
tains, it need only be said that, on comparison with others from
Loch Maree, Gaerloch, &c., it is impossible to recognize any dif
ference in them, the metamorphism being in each case identical in
character, and garnets and other crystals occur in them in equal
 abundance. The strike of the beds at Ben Fyn he found also to be
almost identical with that of those on the west coast, the dip being
either to the N.E. or E., and seldom if ever south of that point. He
also found these rocks, and with a similar strike, in the low ground
in Glyn Dooherty, near the road to Auchnasheen ; and there the
Silurian beds are seen resting unconformably upon them. From
this the author believes that the Cambrian and Silurian beds are
 contained in a basin or depression formed of the older rocks, being,
however, now altered in their dip and position by slight faults and
 some folding which has taken place since they were deposited.
    3. " On the Triassic Rocks of Normandy     and their Environments.''
By W. A. E. Ussher, Esq., F.G.S.
    The author stated that his investigations were confined to the
provinces of Calvados and La Manche, more especially the latter.
Having briefly alluded to the physical areas of the Bocage and
Cotentin, he proceeded to show that whilst the Secondary rocks were
 confined to the Cotentin, the presence of several Palaeozoic inliers
proved that they were of no great thickness.            He then briefly
described several sections illustrative of observations made by him
 in walking over the Triassic districts of Valognes, Montebourg, and
 Carentan, and of Bayeux in Calvados. The result arrived at (as
 far as possible, despite the presence of drift* concealing the Trias
 almost everywhere) was that the Norman Trias is composed of
 gravels, sands and sandstones, and marls.      The gravels replace and
 give place to sand and sandstone ; but the position of the marls could
 only be distinctly ascertained near Carentan, where they underlie
 sandstones.    The gravels and sands either directly underlie the
 Infra-lias, or are separated from it by a thin bed of marl. The
 Norman Trias can scarcely exceed 200 feet in thickness.
    The author then briefly enumerated the Palaeozoic rocks of the
 Bocage, and summed up the results of his investigations in the
 following conclusions :—
    First, that the Triassic rocks of Normandy are the south-easterly
  prolongation of the Triassic area of Somerset and Devon.

                                   On Foyaite.                               153
    Secondly, that Upper Keuper deposits are alone represented in
Normandy.
    Thirdly, that fragments of the Palaeozoic rocks of what is now
Normandy were never incorporated in the Triassic rocks of Devon.
    Fourthly, that the constitution of the coasts of Normandy, Devon,
and Cornwall is such as to justify a belief that varieties of
Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, and Granitic rocks formed the bed of
the Triassic waters in the area now occupied by the English
Channel, and that to these sources fragments foreign to the Devon
shire soil found in the Triassic beds on the South-Devon coast are
to be attributed.
    4. " On Foyaite, an Elaeolitic Syenite occurring in Portugal."
By C. P. Sheibner, Esq., Ph.D., F.G.S.             Communicated by Prof. T.
M'Kenny Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.
    The name foyaite is derived from Mount Foya, in the south of
Portugal.      This rock occurs intrusive in Devonian grauwacke in
the ancient province of Algarve, where it forms two dome-shaped
hills, the Foya and the Picota, rising respectively to 2968 feet and
2410 feet.       The texture of the rock varies from fine- to coarse
grained, and is sometimes porphyritic.             An almost compact variety
occurs cutting the coarser rock in dykes and veins. The coarser rock
occurs mainly on the southern slopes, where, however, the adjoining
 grauwacke is less altered than elsewhere. The mas&if is also cut by
 intrusive veins of phonolite and basalt of Tertiary age.             Much rock
 has probably been removed from the district by denudation.
     Macroscopically      foyaite consists       of orthoclase, elaeolite, and
 greenish    hornblende.       Orthoclaso     with   imbedded elaeolite occurs
 porphyritically.      A   lens    shows   titanito,   biotite, magnetite, and
 pyrite   to be  accessories.      Microscopically    examined,   the above con
 stituents are seen to be present, and exhibit considerable variety in
  their mode of occurrence, together with nosean and sodalite as
  characteristic accessories, and occasional plagioclase (recognized as
 oligoclase), muscovite, haematite, and apatite. The elaeolite is irre
  gular in outline; nosean and sodalite are often associated Vith and
 imbedded in it.       The latter minerals are associated and intergrown.
  Their mode of octHrrence and the tests for their presence are
  described in detail.       Hornblende and augite occur in foyaite in
  about equal quantities, associated and intergrown.               These also are
 fully  described,  as  well  as  the  characteristics  of  the other accessories.
  Analyses    of  the   elaeolitc  and   the  foyaite   are  given.   The  author
  concludes by pointing out the close resemblance                of the rock to
  ditroite, miascite, and certain syenites of Brevig and Cape Verd,
  stating that on this account there is no need of a special group of
 foyaites.

PHOTOGRAPHY AT THE LEAST-REFRANGIBLE END OF THE SOLAR
         BPECTRCM.  BY C'AIT. ABXKY, H.E., F.R.S.
               two years ago I had the honour of rending a preliminary
NEARLY
   note on      photographing the least-refrangible end of the spec
                                                     I
trum ; and it seems that the time has come when ought to redeem
the promise implied by a " preliminary note
                                                  ''
                                                     and enter further
into the subject. Last year, owing to a change in residence, wasI
unable to pursue the subject with any degree of activity ; but
during this last winter and the present spring 1 have made fair
progress in my researches, the results of which      I   lay before the
meeting.     These results are principally photographs themselves ;
and the first to which  I   shall call attention is one taken through
three prisms of dense flint glass, each of which had a vertical
angle of 62°.     They were placed at the angle of minimum devia
tion of B, and kept so. The focal lengths of the collimator and
camera were 18 inches and 2 feet respectively ; and a condensing
lens of 0 feet focus was employed to collect the light, the middle
of the collimating lens alone being filled with solar rays. In front
of the slit was placed a plate of orange glass, in order to cut off
the suffused blue rays, which experience had previouslv taught me
were inimical to the production of good negatives, owing to the
 light dispersed in the prisms themselves. It will be noticed to
what an enormous distance below A the impressions of the bands
in the ultra red are to found. If the wave-lengths be used as
abscissae and the measured distances of the known lines be used
as ordinates, it will be found, if the waves be completed by hand,
that a wave-length of not less than 10,400 tenth metres is im
 pressed.    Roughly speaking, A is 7600 tenth metres, and D
 5900 tenth metres — \>y which it will be seen that  I   was within the
 mark when  I   announced that    Ihad obtained photographs as much
 below A as D was above it. Now this negative, though interesting
 as a feat iu photography, has no practical scientific value, as the
 ultra red is so tremendously compressed that the absolute wave
 lengths could not be obtained from it.
    About the time 1 read my last paper. Captain Tupman kindly
 lent me a speculum -metal grating, by Kutherford, having about
 8600 lines to the inch ; but it was only lately, after removing its
 glass covering, that I was fully able to appreciate its value.      In
 all gratings the red, or rather the ultra red, of the first order is
 overlapped by the ultra violet and violet of the second order, and
 the higher th'e order the more overlap there is.       To remedy this,
 which was a defect for the purpose for which            Irequired  it,
                                                                     I
 placed before the slit of the collimator red glass, which completely
 cut off the yellow and only allowed   a   little of the green to pass.
 The prisms were replaced    by  the grating, anda    photograph of th«

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              155
second order of the spectrum was taken by it.              Theoretically
speaking, the time necessary for taking a photograph of the first
order is -j that for taking one of the second, and -fa for that of the
third. Practically this is not quite true, for reasons which it is
unnecessary to enter into here. This induced me to think that
if  I  could get a grating with double the number of lines to the
inch, its first order would give me the same dispersion as the
second order of the grating    I was using, and at the same time the
exposure ought to be more than halved. Mr. Lockyer kindly lent
me such a grating ; and the third photograph was taken by it.
You will see that it gives the lines from C to A almost perfectly.
A positive copy of this photograph       I  sent to Professor Piazzi
Smyth, as he drew the map of this region of the spectrum, which
he published in the last volume of the ' Edinburgh Astronomical
Observations ;' and     I cannot do better than quote his words re
                                                 "
garding the accuracy of the photograph : — As the size of the
glasses approximated closely to my standard-camera size, 2'25 inches
  X 4-25 inches, 1 was able at once to view them with any magnify
ing power in a compound microscope long since arranged for such
things ; and the effect was astounding.      I  almost thought     I was
back again in Lisbon, viewing the Sun's spectrum itself as 1 used
to see it."
    This acknowledgment of the value of the photograph was
particularly gratifying, as it came from an astronomer who
 had paid special attention       to this particular      part of the
spectrum.
    The next plate shows the region of the ultra red as taken with
the same grating.      The most conspicuous group has a wave-length
 of about 8400 tenth metres ; and the extreme line visible has a
 wnve-length of about 9200 tenth metres.            At this point the
 closer-ruled grating seemed to fail me, and   I  could not get beyond
 this point.    It then struck me that the glass on which the lines
 were ruled might absorb the rays beyond (for          I   must explain
 that this grating was ruled on glass and silvered at the
 back), or that the red glass might absorb them.                 I   then
 reverted to the first grating and adopted a different method of
proceeding.
                                               I
    This was Fraunhofers method, to which was practically new —
 though   I believe  I have been credited (though inaccurately) with
 using it for other experiments ; and after various attempts the
 following is an outline of the arrangement adopted.            The slit
was placed horizontally ; a prism of 60° occupied a position at the
end of the collimator next the lens ; the reflection-grating         then
 received the rays and reflected them into the camera-lens, the
 camera being tilted at an angle to make them fall on the sensitive
 plate.                                                 I
          To show what sort of effect can be got, exhibit a pho
 tograph in which from the first to the fourth order of spectra
 were impressed on the same plate in a small camera.         When this

156            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
method was applied to the larger apparatus                   I   got further into
the ultra red than     I  had done before ; and such a plate you see
before you : the wave-length of the last line of my group of lines
visible on the plate is about 10,300 tenth metres. From indica
tions on other plates        I  am inclined to think that we may get as
far as 12,000 tenth" metres, which it will be admitted is a tolerable
distance to travel along the invisible spectrum.                    In these ultra
regions    the  lines  are   faint,    but   perfectly    measurable      under a
moderate magnifying-power ; and               I  have therefore proposed to
myself to make a map of the ultra red. For the purpose                        I pro
pose to use the overlapping of the higher order of the spectrum
over that used.      By cutting off the red in one case and using half
the length of the slit for one exposure, and then by cutting off
the blue and using the remaining half of the slit for the other,
we shall have one spectrum over the other.                     The wave-lengths
of the most-refrangible          rays    are    known   ;   and     since the dis
persion   of the   higher  order    is  double   that of   the   one  below it, the
wave-lengths of the latter         can   be accurately      ascertained.      When
once a scale is obtained, the greatest                     difficulty    will   have
vanished.
   Now as to the process. My object has been to weight the
molecules of silver bromide that they may absorb the red rays.
With ordinary silver bromide the film allows these very rays
to pass through, whilst a blue absorption takes place. In other
words, my endeavour has been to find a heavier molecule of a
sensitive salt, which shall answer to the swing of the waves of
the red and ultra-red rays. This           I  first accomplished (as       I  stated
at the time) by adding resins to the silver salt and forming what
I  may call a bromo-resinate of silver.             But    I   am happy to say
that   I  have secured the same end by,               I   believe, doubling the
molecule of the silver bromide.              Now this doubling the molecule
is a matter of manipulation more than of chemical knowldge :
and   I  might describe the process in detail, as           I  have already done
in papers    I have published, and yet the double molecule would
not be obtained unless careful manipulation were attended to —
manipulation easy to follow when seen, but difficult to follow
from any description.         I   should therefore prefer to teach prac
tically any one who is acquainted with silver-bromide-emulsion-
making, rather than allow him to be misled by what must be
imperfect directions.
    I   exhibit two films, both prepared with sensitive emulsion
which is composed of exactly similar ingredients, viz. pure silver
bromide.      You will at once note the difference in colour of the
light  transmitted.      The one which is sensitive to the red and ultra
red is of blue tint ; the other is orange. You will see that the
blue tint would appear to be due to a physical arrangement of the
molecules ; for if a part of the film be rubbed you will see that it
changes to a ruddy tint, passing through an emerald-green stage.

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                     157
We   have      it so on the screen. Whether it be right or wrong in
regard    to   other matter, I      am convinced that in silver bromide
we have the possible existence of two sizes of molecules. In the
blue film we have the presence of both ; when only the larger
size is present we shall have a compound which is very much
more sensitive to the lower end of the spectrum than it is to the
upper.     Allow me to say that these views are not original, except
in so far as they are applied to this subject. Whether they are
correct or not, they have formed a good working hypothesis which
 has led me to the results obtained.
    Before closing      Imust refer to the comparative lengths of ex
posure required       for these photographs.          My impression is that at
A the exposure required is about 25 times that required for G, in
a fairly bright sun at midday ; for the ultra red, as far as            Ihave
       I
gone, should say about 35 times. These are only approximations,
but still will enable you to form some idea of the sensitiveness.             I
show you a photograph taken about 4 P.M. on March 18.                     The
exposure was about 50 seconds.              You will see that the red end is
as strong as the blue, with the yellow much lacking in density.             In
other words, the yellow rays are nearly inactive.
    The photograph which        I   showed you of the four orders of the
 spectrum      was   taken   on   April 3, at 2.30. It had an exposure of
one   minute     and   a half.    The    photograph in which the furthest
band    of   lines  was   seen    had   an  exposure of 12 minutes, on the
 8th, at 2.30.       The slit was in this case closed as nearly as pos
sible.
                        I
    In conclusion, have to remark that in a short time hope to      I
 reduce the exposures considerably.             In the course of some investi
 gations,  the   results  of   which   have   just been communicated to the
 Royal Society,     I  found   that   the  red   rays could oxidize a photo
 graphic image      as  well as     it,
                                 form       and   that in an oxidized state  it
 was unable to be developed. If the tendency of the sensitive
 compound to become oxidized exceeded its tendency to become
 reduced, no image could be developed. By exposing in vacua, or in
a  nitrogen atmosphere, hope to eliminate altogether this oxidizing
                            I

           ON THE   FRICTION OF VAPOURS.         BY DR.   J. PULUJ.
   Friction-experiments    with vibrating disks confirm for vapours
also the law   that the friction    isindependent of the pressure up to
the limit of saturation,   and   the   law of its proportionality to the
absolute temperature,     which    latter law has been experimentally
proved by A. v. Obermeyer and the author for more easily com
pressible gases.
   For ether-vapour the calculation gave, within the temperature

The experiments were made on seven vapours, for which the mean
lengths of path were calculated and compared with the exponents
of refraction determined by Dulong.
   The remarkable relation pointed out by Director Stefan, starting
from the view that molecules are surrounded by an envelope of
aether, has been confirmed in the case of vapours also.   He showed
in gases that higher exponents of refraction correspond to shorter
lengths of path.   Unfortunately, the refraction-exponents for only
two vapours (the highest hitherto observed) were determined expe
rimentally by Duloug.

    By multiplying the proportional numbers — by 4-7, the values of
v in the penultimate      column are obtained, which agree with the
numbers in the last column, calculated by Kopp, as well as can in
general be expected in experiments of this sort.
    The molecular volume of free hydrogen, 4'7, is less by more than
half than ll'0, the value calculated from its liquid compounds.
 The author endeavours to account for this in the following manner.
If molecules are spheres surrounded with envelopes of aether of
variable density, two such molecules, on central impact taking
place, will probably act on each other as soon as they arrive at a
distance from one another equal to the sum of the radii of the aftual
sphere of action.      The action lasts until the vis viva is reduced to
zero and reversed.      Molecules with greater velocities, in the gaseous
state, will approach nearer to one another, and reciprocally pene
trate with their sother envelopes more deeply than molecules with
lower velocities, in the liquid state.   Hence in the former case the
radius of the apparent sphere of action, consequently the molecular
volume, must be smaller than in tho latter.
    To the same assumption of a variable sphere of action we are
conducted, as first remarked by Director Stefan, by the fact that
the friction-constant is proportional not to the square root of the
 absolute temperature, but to another power of the same, which, ac
cording to the experiments of A. v. Obermeyer and the author, is
greater than £ and at the highest is =1.
    A second basis of explanation may, according to the view of
Lothar Meyer, lie in the circumstance that, in determining the mo
lecular volume from the density of the liquid compounds, with them
the empty space is measured which is open to the atoms for their
motions, while, from the magnitude of the obstruction which one
 particle constitutes for another, only the volume of the gas particles
themselves is determined.
    Experiments with air under very low pressures led to this result
— that while the pressure diminished from 754 to 0'03 millim. the
 friction-constant became less by only about one half of its initial
 value, from which it may be seen how proportionally great must be
the quantity of gas which remains in a very good vacuum, since it
can convey quantities of motion so considerable.        This is in excel
lent accordance with the kinetic theory of gases, according to which,
in a cubic centimetre of air of one millionth of an atmosphere pres
 sure, nineteen billion molecules are still present. — Kaiserliche Aka-

   ON THE DEPOLARIZATION         OF THE ELECTRODES BY THE SOLU
                        TIONS.   BY M. LIPPMANN.
    It  has long  been known that certain salts possess a depolarizing
property.      The first pile with a constant current, constructed in

160             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
1829 by M. Becquerel, owes its constancy to the employment of
sulphate of copper ; the sulphates of zinc and cadmium have been
made use of by MM. du Bois-Reymond and J. Regnault for the
construction of impolarizable electrodes and constant elements.
Notwithstanding the importance of its applications, this property
appears to have been but little studied.       The experiments    I  am
about to describe have made evident an essential condition of the
phenomenon.
    It is the following : in order that the electrode may be depo
larized, it must be formed of the same metal as is contained in the
solution.    Thus copper is the only metal which becomes depolarized
in sulphate nf copper, while gold, silver, and platinum are polarized
in that solution. Inversely, copper polarizes in sulphate of zinc,
cobak, &c.      A salt depolarizes only its own metal. To make the
experiment, operating for example on sulphate of copper and plati
num, two strips of platinum are to be immersed in tne liquid, and
put into communication with the poles of a capillary electrometer.
The mercury column is then at zero. A feeble current is then
caused to pass into the liquid so as to employ one of the strips as ne
gative or exit electrode. The electrometer shows a deflection, which
remains even after the interruption of the current, thus proving
that polarization is produced in the sulphate of copper, as it might
have been produced in pure or acidulated water.          For the same
reason, a couple formed of strips of copper and platinum dipping
in sulphate of copper furnishes only a current of brief duration,
the platinum receiving, owing to its polarization, an electromotive
force equal and opposite to that of the copper.      One may even go
further and communicate to the platinum, by means of an exterior
pile, an electromotive force superior to that of the copper, so that
then the platinum will behave like a more negative, more oxidizable
metal than copper.
    Similar experiments have been made with strips and solutions of
silver, mercury, lead, cobalt, and zinc.
    An application readily presents itself. Since the property of
 depolarizing a metal belongs exclusively to its salts, it permits us
 to detect the presence of that metal in a solution.    Taking copper
 as an example, if we dip into the liquid to be tested a copper wire
 which we use for the negative electrode of a feeble current, it will
 be polarized if there is no dissolved copper, it will not be polarized
if the solution contains^^- of sulphate of copper. It is possible,
 therefore, thus to detect the presence of copper in a mixture of
 metallic salts. With a silver wire we can in the same way test
 for silver. The delicacy of this electric process appears to be
 still greater for silver than for copper ; but it has not yet been
 measured. — Comptes Rendusde TAcadernie desSeieuces, June24, 1878,

          XXIII.    Recent Researches in     Solar Chemistry.
                   By  J.   N. LOCKYER, F.R.S.*
          work which    is   now being done in the various new
THEfields opened      up   in  connexion with solar studies may be
conveniently divided into three perfectly distinct branches.
We have, first, that extremely important branch which has for
its result the complete determination of the position of every
thing which happens on the Sun.           This, of course, includes a
complete cataloguing of the spots on the sun which have been
observed time out of mind, and also of those solar promi
nences the means of observing which have not been so long
within our reach.     It is of the highest importance that these
data should be accumulated, more especially because it has.
been determined that both in the case of spots and promi
nences there are distinct cycles, which may in the future be
very much fuller of meaning to us than they seem to be at
present.
   This brings me to refer to the second branch of the work ;
and it is this : — These various cycles of the spots and promi
nences have long occupied the attention both of meteorologists
and magneticians ; and one of the most interesting fields of
modern inquiry, a field in which very considerable activity has
been displayed in the last few years, is one which seeks to connect
these various indications' of changes in the sun with changes in
our own atmosphere. The sun, of course, is the only variable that

  162                Mr. J.   N. Lockyer on Recent
 we have.     Taking the old view of the elements, we have fire re
 presented by our sun, variable if our sun is variable. Earth, air,
 and water, in this planet of ours we must recognize as constants.
  From this point of view, therefore, it is not at all to be won
 dered at that both magneticians and meteorologists should
 have already traced home to solar changes a great many of
 the changes with which we are more familiar.          This second
 branch of work depends obviously upon the work done in the
 first, which has to do with the number (the increasing or de
 creasing number) of the spots and prominences, and the vari
 ations of the positions which these phenomena occupy on the
 surface of the sun. As a result of this work, then, we shall
 have a complete cataloguing of every thing on the sun, and a
 complete comparison of every thing on the sun with every me
 teorological phenomenon which is changeable in our planet.
     When we come to the third branch of the work, the newest
 branch, things are not in such a good condition. The workers
 are too few ; and one of the objects of any one who is inter
 ested in this kind of knowledge at the present moment must
 be to see if he cannot induce other workers to come into the
 field. The attempt to investigate the chemistry of the sun, even
 independently of the physical problems which are, and indeed
 must be, connected with chemical questions, is an attempt
 almost to do the impossible unless a very considerable amount
 of time and a very considerable number of men be engaged
 upon the work.      If we can get as many workers taking up
 various questions dealing with the chemistry of the sun as
 we find already in other branches,    I think we may be certain
that the future advance of our knowledge of the sun will be
associated with a future advance of very many problems which
at the present moment seem absolutely disconnected from it.
    I have today to limit myself to this chemical branch of the
inquiry ; and first let me begin by referring to the characteris
                                            I
tics of the more recent work with which have to deal. Here,
as in other branches of physical and chemical inquiry, advance
depends largely upon the improved methods which all branches
of the science are now placing at the disposal of all others.
Our knowledge of the chemical nature of the sun is now being
as much advanced by photography, for instance, as that de
scriptive work of which     I  spoke in the first instance (which
deals with the chronicling and location of the various phe
nomena) has, in its turn, been advanced by the aid of photo
graphy.     I  do not know whether the magnificent results
recently obtained by Dr. Janssen have been brought before
this Society ; but the increase in photographic power recently
secured by Dr. Janssen is one which was absolutely undreamt

                 Researches in    Solar Chemistry.                 1(53
of onlya few years ago.   It is now possible to record every
change which goes on on the sun down to a region so small
that one hardly likes to challenge belief by mentioning it.
Changes over regions embracing under one second of angular
magnitude in the centre of the sun's disk can now be faith
fully recorded and watched from hour to hour.
   One of the advantages which has come from the introduc
tion of the new apparatus has been the possibility of making
maps, on a very large scale, of the solar lines and of the me
tallic lines which have to be compared with them.      Thanks to
the great generosity of Mr. Rutherfurd, who is making the most
magnificent refraction-gratings which have ever been seen,
and who is spreading them broadcast among all workers in
science, one has now easy means of obtaining with inexpen
sive apparatus a spectrum of the sun, and of mapping it on
such a scale that the full magnification of the fine Tine of
light which is allowed to come through the slit will form a
spectrum the half of a furlong long : an entire spectrum on
this scale, when complete (as       Ihope it some day will be,
though certainly not in our time) from the ultra-violet, already
mapped by Mascart and Cornu, to the ultra-red, which has
quite recently for the first time been brought under our ken
by Captain Abney, will be 315 feet long. This is a consider
able scale to apply to the investigation of these problems ; but
recent work has shown that, gigantic as the scale    is, itis
                                                            really
not beyond what   is  required for honest patient work.    I have
already had an opportunity of bringing before the Physical
Society several of the methods in use for comparing the spectra
of the various elementary bodies with that of the sun. It not,is
therefore, necessary now to refer to them.    There are, however,
others of recent application which are of very considerable
importance.
   When, instead of inquiring into the coincidence of the me
tallic lines, we wish to determine the coincidence of the lines
due to various gases, the method hitherto employed has been
to enclose the gases in Geissler tubes, to reduce their pressure,
and in that way to fine down the lines. The importance of
this apparently small matter can be very well demonstrated by
an experiment easily arranged in an electric lamp, which sodium
enables us to perform without any great difficulty.     The point
of this experiment  is that, ifwe vary the density of any vapour,
we vary sometimes to     avery considerable extent the thickness
and intensity of the lines.  I  am about to throw the spectrum
on a small screen which  I   hare behind the lamp and       hope
                                                           I I
                                                     ;
I shall succeed in rendering the phenomena visible.         want
vou to observe the variation in the thickness of the reversed

  164               Mr. J.  N. Lockyeron Recent
 line of sodium. Every turn of the screw which raises or
 lowers the upper pole, enables me to vary to a very consider
 able extent indeed the thickness of that absorption-line.
    Now the way in which that has been managed is very simple.
 The only arrangement required is one which shall enable me
 at will to vary the density of the sodium-vapour.          When   I
 make the sodium-vapour as dense as possible, then the line is
 very thick. When I make it much less dense, the line becomes
 thinner.    If the spectrum on the screen had been a gas-spec
 trum (supposing it were possible to exhibit a gas-spectrum to
 an audience), the exact equivalent of that experiment would
 have been, that the gaseous spectrum at atmosphere pressure
 would have given us most of the lines as thick as the sodium-
 line was at its thickest ; while if by any possibility we could
 have rendered the phenomena visible while the pressure was
 being reduced, as the pressure of the gas was reduced the
 line would thin.    Now there are very great objections to the
using of Geissler tubes.       One very valid objection is that the
gas becomes much less luminous as its pressure is reduced.
    Here is a method which is excellent in this way, that it en
ables all the work connected with gaseous spectra to be done
at atmospheric pressure, and we get the line down as thin as we
choose, not by reducing the pressure, but by reducing the quantity
of gas in a mixture.     If we take, for instance, a spark in ordi
nary atmospheric    air and observe its spectrum, we find the lines
of the constituents of atmospheric air considerably thick ; but
    I
if wish to reduce the lines, say of oxygen, down to a consi
derable fineness so that I can photograph its lines (these should
be fine,in order to enable me to determine their absolute posi
tion ; to accomplish this) the spark is made to pass in a glass
vessel with two adits and one exit tube.       If I wish to observe
the oxygen-lines fine,    I flood the vessel with nitrogen so that,
say, there is only 1 per cent. of oxygen present, and observe the
current between the enclosed electrodes.       If I wish to observe
 nitrogen-lines fine, I flood it with oxygen, so that there is
 only 1 per cent. of nitrogen present.      In this way, by merely
 making an admixture in which the gas to be observed is quan
titatively reduced, so that the lines which we wish to investi
gate are just visible in their thinnest state, we have a perfect
means of doing this without any apparatus depending on the
use of low pressures ; and those who have worked most with
Geissler tubes will appreciate the very great simplicity of work
which is thus introduced.
    Another important application of spectroscopic theory re
cently applied to the investigation of the chemistry of the sun
is this : — Assume that the spectrum of any substance is not a

                 KesearcJies    in Solar Chemistry.             165
pure spectrum of that substance, but of that substance as it
generally exists in an impure state.
    The spectrum will be found rich in lines ; and when very
considerable care is employed, one may go away with the idea
that in iron, for instance, all the lines which are observed in
the spectrum of iron coincident with Fraunhofer lines repre
sent coincidences in the case of each lino with iron in the sun
and iron in our laboratory.      But the more the work is carried
on, the more one finds that the complex spectra which are ob
served are really much more simple when all the impurities
are taken into account.
    In the region of the solar spectrum, for instance, recorded
on the map exhibited we have a great many iron-lines ; but
before the method of determining impurities was utilized, the
spectrum was very much richer than it is at present ; possibly
one fourth of the lines have been withdrawn.     In every specimen
of iron which has been used in this work the lines of calcium,
aluminium, and some of the lines of manganese and cobalt have
been represented ; and no chemist will wonder at this result.
But there is a very curious thing which chemists, I think, will
wonder at.     In this part of the spectrum there were two lines
which, by their thickness both in the solar and iron spectra,
seemed undoubtedly to belong to iron ; but further inquiry led
to this extraordinary result — that one of these lines in all proba
bility has its origin in the vibration of molecules of tungsten,
the other being probably a line of molybdenum.            Glucinum
is another mctaJ which may be referred to in this connexion ;
and it would appear that it is almost impossible to get a spe
cimen of iron which does not contain, not only calcium and
aluminium, but others which we consider rare metals on the
earth, such as tungsten, molybdenum, and glncinum.
    A few years ago, taking the work of Kirchhoff, Bunsen,
Angstrom, and Thalen into consideration, and connecting           it,
so far as one could connect        with those ideas of which recent
                                    it,
eclipses have been so fruitful, our chemical view of the sun's
atmosphere was one something like this — We had, let us say,
                                              :
first of all an enormous shell of some gas, probably lighter
than hydrogen, about which we know absolutely nothing,
because at present none of       has been found here
                                it                    ;   inside this
we have another shell, of hydrogen inside this we have another
                                          ;
shell, of calcium, another of magnesium, another of sodium,
and then a complex shell the section of which has been called
the reversing layer, in which we get all the metals of the
iron group plus such other metals as cadmium, manganese,
 titanium, barium, and so on. The solar atmosphere, then, from
 top to bottom, consisted,     was imagined, of
                               it                 a series of shells,

                         Mr.   J. N.   Lockyer on Recent
the shells being due not to the outside substance existing only
outside, but to the outside substance extending to the bottom
of the sun's atmosphere, and finding in it at a certain height
another shell, which again formed another shell inside    and so    it,
on;   so that the composition of the solar atmosphere as one
went down into           it,

to add a considerable number of new elements to this reversing

found to do,    may be,

to consist of about thirty.
   The metals considered to be solar as the result of the
labours of Kirchhoff, Angstrom, and Thalen together with
the considerations brought forward regarding the length                   of the
lines, were as follows: —
           Na              Fe               Ca     Mg          Ni

their existence in the solar atmosphere      rendered probable,

   It important to bear in mind that the lines recorded in

these Tables are in most cases the very longest visible
in the photographic region of the respective spectra in some    ;
cases they are limited to the region 39-40, which     have more

especially studied so that the fact of their being reversed
                           ;
in the solar spectrum must be considered the strongest evi
dence obtainable in favour of the existence in the sun of the
metals to which they belong, pending the complete investiga
tion of their spectra.
   Where, however, there      only one line, as with Li, Rb, Ac.,
                                       is
the presence of these metals in the sun's reversing layer can,
for the present, only be said to be probable. Neither must                     it
be forgotten that, in addition to the long lines which     spec       a
trum may contain in the red, yellow, or orange, long lines
may exist in the hitherto unexplored ultra-violet region       so          ;
that the necessity for waiting for further evidence before de
ciding finally upon the presence or absence of such metals in
the sun will be rendered obvious.
   It will be thonght remarkable that, the long lines of such
                                                 if
metals as lithium and rnbidinm are found in the photographic
region of the spectrum, the long lines Li W.L. 6705, Kb
 W.L. 6205 and 6296 should have escaped detection.

  To this it may be replied that, although these red lines may
be apparently the brightest to the eye, it by no means follows
they are the longest, since they are situated in a part of the
spectrum which affects the visual organ more strongly than the
photographic region does. It is possible also that the reason
      I
ing have lately used in a paper communicated to the Royal
Society, on the spectrum of calcium, may be applied in these
cases.
    Since a sensitized film is affected by some rays more strongly
 than by others, in determining the lengths of lines from a pho
 tograph it is not fair to compare together portions of the
 spectrum separated by too great an interval.
    Furthermore, the fact of these red lines having been over
 looked in the solar spectrum is not conclusive proof of their
absence, inasmuch as this portion of the spectrum is both
 brighter and less refrangible, and a greater degree of disper
sion would be necessary when prisms are employed to render
visible faint dark lines which are easily detected in the photo
graphic region.
    At present, then, out of the fifty-one metals with which
we are acquainted here, more than thirty are known to exist
in the sun with more or less certitude. Now it was a very
remarkable thing that although such metalloids as carbon and
sulphur, iodine, bromine, and the like, had been very dili
gently searched for, no trace whatever had been found of
them, giving any evidence that they existed together with the
metals in these zones (these shells) to which   I   have referred.
    Some years ago evidence was brought forward of the pos
sible existence of the metalloids as a group outside the metals ;
and the evidence for this suggestion was of the following
nature: — Independently of any questions connected with solar
physics,  I think all students of science now agree that the
vapours of the various elementary bodies exist in different
molecular states ; if these different molecular states are studied
by means of the spectroscope, perfectly different spectroscopic
phenomena present themselves.           Ifwe use a large coil, we
can drive every chemical substance with which we are
acquainted, including carbon and silicon, into a molecular
grouping competent to give us what is called a line spectrum,
the spectrum with which we are most familiar when we use
metals or salts of metals in the electric arc.
    If, however, other conditions are fulfilled ; if these bodies"
are not so roughly handled —      if, in other words, we employ a
lower degree of heat, or     if we use electricity so that we get
quantity instead of tension, then these line spectra die away
altogether, and we have      a spectrum, so called, of channelled

                          Perhaps it will be convenient that should
throw one of these spectra on the screen, and point out exactly
the difference to which       I refer.  I will first call attention to a
line spectrum.       Those lines are due to the vibrations of mole
cules of calcium and aluminium.            The flutings which     I now
throw on the screen are perfectly different in appearance ;
in this case they have been produced by the vibrations of
carbon at exactly the same temperature at which we get the
line spectrum from aluminium and calcium.
      Now, while we got these thirty-three metals to give ns line
spectra coincident with Fraunhofer lines, the only evidence
(very doubtful evidence) of the existence of the metalloids in
the sun at all, depended on the fact that, in the case of iodine
and chlorine, some of the channelled spaces observed in their
 spectra at a very low temperature were imagined to be traced
 among the Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum of the sun. It
 is four years ago since evidence was gathered of a more con
 clusive kind in the case of carbon. The kind of evidence will
 be sufficiently indicated by throwing a comparison of the solar
 and carbon spectra on the screen.          Below we have the bright
 flutings due to carbon-vapour ; and above the solar spectrum
 this photograph includes a part in the ultra violet. When this
  negative is placed under a magnifying-glass, we find that
  most of the very delicate lines constituting the fluting in the
  bright portion have their exact equivalents among the Fraun
  hofer lines. This is the best-established piece of evidence, so
           I
  far as know, which seems to indicate that we have truly some
  of the metalloids present in the atmosphere of the sun by
  the coincidence of their spectra with the Fraunhofer lines.
  Further, carbon at all events exists under such conditions that
  its molecular structure is very much more complex than that
  of the metals in the reversing layer; and therefore it is pro
  bably withdrawn from the excessive heat of the lower region oc
  cupied by the reversing layer, which is competent, as we know
  from from other considerations, to drive even carbon and silicon
   into the line-stage, supposing carbon and silicon to be there.
       This branch of the work to which I have just referred, a
   branch which enables us to say that such a temperature must
  exist in such and such a region of the solar atmosphere, de
   pends, in the main, upon questions raised by the differences
   between the spectra of certain bodies in the sun and in our
   laboratories.    If, for instance, one wishes to observe the coin
   cidence between, let us say, iron and the sun, iron is placed
    in the electric lamp ; its spectrum is photographed : side by
    side with it we have the spectrum of the sun also photo
   graphed ; and, as a rule (I say as a rule ; but this is not abso

172               Mr.   J.   N. Lockyer on Recent
lute in the case of such metals as iron), the intensity of
the iron-lines which we get in our laboratories is equivalented
by the intensity of the so-called iron-lines which we assume to
exist in the spectrum of the sun.       That is the great argument,
in fact, for the existence of iron in the sun. But when we
leave the iron group of metals, we find others in which this
coincidence, this great similarity of intensity from one end of
the spectrum to the other, is very considerably changed. We
get in the case of calcium very thick lines of calcium corre
 sponding with very thin lines in the sun, and we get thin lines
of calcium corresponding with very thick lines in the sun. In
 fact, the two thickest lines which have already been mapped
m the spectrum of the sun are lines due to calcium.               If
                                                                  we
photographed     the spectrum   of calcium  with  a very weak arc  in
that electric lamp, they would scarcely be visible at all. If,
however, we pass from the tension of the arc to the tension
which is obtainable with the use of a very large coil, then we can
make the spectrum which we get artificially correspond exactly
with the spectrum with which the sun presents us naturally ;
and the more we increase the tension (the larger the coil and
the larger the jar we employ), the more can we make our ter
restrial calcium vibrate in harmony, so to speak, with the cal
cium which occupies a very definite region in the atmosphere
of the sun. Now this gives us this very precious teaching: —
We know that the vapour of calcium occupies such and such a po
sition in the sun; we know that to get the two things in harmony,
as I said before, we must employ a very large induction-coil ;
and we know, again, that if we do employ a large induction-
 coil, all these beautiful flutings in the carbon-spectrum which
have been thrown on the screen disappear utterly.         That kind
of carbon is no longer present in the reaction ; but instead of
it we have a new kind of carbon which is only competent to
give us bright lines. We know, fourthly, that those bright lines
do not exist reversed in the spectrum of the sun.          Therefore
the carbon must exist higher than the calcium, in a region of
lower temperature.
  In what   I have   said up to the present moment (and       I   have
just touched very slightly on the physical side of the work,
because I believe that in the future it will be most rich in
teachings of the kind I have indicated),          I
                                           must remind you
that I have dealt solely with the Fraunhofer lines. Now it is
knowledge ten years old, that     if we   observe the solar spectrum
with that considerable dispersion which is now,       I
                                                   think, impe
rative if we are to do much good with       it,
                                          there are bright lines
in the ordinary solar spectrum side by side with the dark ones.

                   Researches in  Solar Chemistry.             1 73.
    In a paper communicated to the Royal Society in 1868          I
find these words : — "Attention has recently been drawn to cer
tain bright regions in the ordinary spectrum."        The position
of these bright lines in the ordinary spectrum was then stated,
and attention was called, among others, to one between b and
F.    I call especial attention to that line now because the re
quisite amount of dispersion is now so common that any one,
whenever the sun shines, may turn to b and see that bright
line for himself.     It will be found just as much outside the
fourth line   of b as the third line is on the other side of it.
This bright line, lying in the most visible part of the spectrum,
is exactly similar to many others, some of them in the yellow
and some of them in the red.         A careful list of these lines
was made some years ago ; and, t am sorry to say, the list
was unfortunately lost by one of my assistants in a Metropo
litan Railway-carriage ; at all events, enough was said in this
and other countries about these bright lines in the years 1869
and 1870 to have given rise, at all events, to the hope that
:my one interested in solar physics would be perfectly familiar
with them. Among other matters which called attention to
their existence was a correspondence which took place in the
 Comptes Rendus of the Academy of Sciences in Paris between
Father Secchi and another observer in connexion with solar
spots.    I have remarked that a large dispersion is requisite to
see these bright lines, because with a small dispersion bright
regions of another kind in the solar spectrum are very obvious.
When this small dispersion, however, is changed for a large
one, one sees that these bright regions in the solar spectrum
are due to the absence of fine lines ; and, indeed, if one ol>-
serves the solar spectrum with considerable dispersion through
a cloud which prevents the fine lines from being seen, then
there is a very considerable relative diminution in the intensity
of some parts of the spectrum, and a very considerable rela
tive increase in others, where these very fine lines are present
and absent relatively, so as to give rise to the appearance of a
very considerable change indeed in the background of the
spectrum.
    When, however, a very considerable dispersion is employed
and photography is brought into play, if precautions be
taken to give sufficient exposure, these bright regions, as op
posed to the bright lines, entirely disappear.     I have here, by
the kindness of two friends, Mr. Rutherfurd and Captain
Abney, the means of showing you exactly what I mean.             A
Rutherfurd grating containing 17,000         lmes  to the inch has
been used as a means of obtainmg the spectrum ; and the film
employed was kindly put on the plate for me by Captain

174                    Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer on Recent
Abney himself.           We find, now; that Mr. Rutherfurd has
given     us   an   engine    of such enormous power that the fine
ness   of  the  collodion   film  is entirely distanced ; that is to say,
we can get from these perfect gratings spectra so extremely
fine and so full of detail, that they can be enlarged until the
structure of the ordinary collodion comes in and prevents a
fine picture.       But if instead of the ordinary collodion process,
those which are being worked out with such success by Cap
tain Abney be employed, then it appears that the film is as
perfect a thing in ita way as the grating is in its way, and
one can go on obtaining any magnification one wants.
    This is a photograph of the H lines obtained by the grating
and film to which 1 have referred. Between the            il and K  lines,
where the eye sees faintly three lines, there are now nearly
a hundred ; and that will speak more than any words of
mine as to the extreme importance of the introduction of pho
tography in such a research as this. Now here there are no
bright lines ; but, very conveniently, this next photograph con
tains one of the bright lines discovered and carefully recorded
by Gornu, who has recorded bright lines in the ordinary
solar spectrum as well as Hennessy.              In exactly the middle
of the held now is the bright line recorded as a bright line by
 Cornu in his map of the blue end of the solar spectrum ; but
excepting that ono bright line, which is much more intense than
any other part of the spectrum, bright lines are non-existent.
     During the course of last year Dr. Draper, of New York,
published the first results of a research which he has undertaken,
going over very much the same ground with regard to the
 metalloids as had been gone over in this country with regard
 to the metals.        Dr. Draper, who has long been known as a
 most earnest student of science, approached this subject with
a wealth of instrumental means almost beyond precedent; and
 his well-known skill and assiduity, in the course of the two or
three years during which his work was carried on, enabled him
 to accumulate facts of the very greatest importance.                I am
 most anxious to make these preliminary remarks, and to state
 my very highest respect for Dr. Draper, because in referring
 to his work      I  shall have to point out that some of his results
are, in my opinion, not yet completely established. Dr. Draper,
 in the first instance, claims the discovery of the bright lines
already referred to, and bases a new theory upon them. It is by
 no means as a stickler for priority that         I regard this as a very
 great pity, but because         I think that, if the very considerable
 literature touching these bright lines (papers by Young, Cornu,
 Hennessy, Secchi, and others) had been before Dr. Draper
 when his paper was written, the necessity for the establish
 ment of a new theory of the solar spectrum, which doubtless

                  Researches in   Solar Chemistry.                     175
cost him very considerable thought, would probably have been
less obvious.
    Dr. Draper was so kind as to send me some little time ago
a photograph of the solar spectrum confronted with the lines
of oxygen ; and the result which this photograph is claimed
to show   is, that considerable number of the oxygen-lines are
                  a
coincident with bright lines in the solar spectrum.                Iwill
throw this photograph of Dr. Draper's on the screen, in order
that we may have common ground of thought.                  The lower
part of the photograph gives the lines of oxygen the middle
                                                          ;
part gives Dr. Draper's photograph of the sun, and the upper
part a photograph of the sun taken in England, which           I   have
put  side by   side  with Dr.  Draper's in order  that  the  definition
of the two photographs may be contrasted.
    On examining the upper photograph with a very consider
able magnifying-power, the detail comes out marvellously, and
the spectrum between the more marked lines             is found to be
occupied with extremely fine lines in those regions where Dr.
 Draper's photograph gives ribbed structure, which,                fear,
                                                                   I
may not be due to the solar spectrum at all.        In the silver-on-
glass gratings, one of which Mr. Ruthcrfurd was so kind as
to give me, I     find that, in consequence of the grating being
ruled on the back surface of the glass and the double trans
mission of the light through the plate, there         is
                                                      a  considerable
formation of Talbot bands, and the solar spectrum              in some
                                                              is
regions entirely hidden and absolutely transformed.               Lines
are made to disappear lines are apparently produced so that
                           ;                                   ;
if one compares       a  part of the spectrum taken with one of
these silver-on-glass gratings with an ordinary refraction-
spectrum, the greatest precaution           isrequisite.     Indeed    I
think am not going beyond the mark when say that the
     I                                                I
positions of all lines below the third or fourth order of inten
sity must be received with very great caution indeed when
these gratings are employed.        So well      this known to Mr.
                                                 is
Rutherfurd himself, who prepared these gratings for another
purpose, that he      is now, with equal generosity, distributing
gratings containing the same number of lines to the inch
(17,300, or something like that) engraved on speculum-metal
in order that these defects may be obviated.
   With regard to this work of Dr. Draper's, then, wish to    I
point out that the photograph in which these comparisons with
the oxygen-lines have been made        is not one which       iscompe
tent to settle such an extremely important question. Secondly,
upon examining these oxygen-lines,       I  do not find the coinci
dences to which he refers with bright solar lines and oxygen-
lines in that part of the spectrum with which         Iam most fami
liar, for the reason that there are no bright lines whatever            in

176            Mr.     J.   N. Lockyer      on   Solar Chemistry.
this portion of the spectrum. I have here enlargements of
negatives going nearly the whole length from G to H, one of
the regions which are included in this photograph of Dr. Dra
per's.    I have carefully gone over these regions line for line;
and in no case do            I
                         see any bright line in the sun whatever,
coincident with any line of oxygen whatever.                     I
                                                         cannot pro
fess to have gone over the ground in the ultra violet ; but it
will appear to me very surprising indeed            when we go fur
                                                           if,
ther, when we include the H ana K lines which have already
been thrown on the screen, that Dr. Draper will find any
possible coincidences with bright lines of the sun even there,
because, when perfect instrumental conditions are brought into
play, no bright line whatever exists in the part of the solar
spectrum which        included in this map.
                        is
    The bright line discovered by Cornu exists outside K                        ;
but between the region included in this map and the            lines G          I
find no obvious bright line.
   There  is  an experiment which any member of the Physical
Society   who  possesses     spectroscope with three or four prisms
                                 a
can make for himself.        Take the spark in air in an apparatus
of the kind to which       have referred, use
                             I                     comparison prism,
                                                           a
flood the air with nitrogen, and in the field of view which
includes  b
             (and therefore one of the most marked bright lines
in the solar spectrum itself) you will find three or four un
doubted lines of oxygen.         have made that experiment, which
is quite  a simple  one    and;       I I
                                   find no coincidences in this part
of the spectrum between any of these oxygen-lines and the
undoubted bright lines.          have not tried
                                      I             yet for the lower

parts of the spectrum in the red and yellow, because              hopeI
that Dr. Draper will try for himself.
I     do not say that Dr. Draper's alleged discovery           no disis
covery at all      say (and
                   I

have been occupied in closely allied work for some considerable
time) that    Ido not hold      to be established.
                                      it
 I    have no doubt that Dr. Draper will carefully go over his
work himself; and       am quite certain that he will be the very
first to hail what
                       I I
                       have said today with satisfaction, because
his desire,    am sure,
               1            the desire of every true man of science,
                                 is
that the truth should prevail.          In any case Dr. Draper has
begun work in        branch of the chemical inquiry into solar
                       a
matters which, up to the present time, has been sadly neg
lected;   and we should all be grateful to him on that ground.
I  have no doubt that he on his side, as            on mine, hopes,
                                                           I

     XXIV.         On the Resistance            of Telegraphic Electromagnets,
                            By OLIVER HEAVISIDK*.
1.   PT1HERE      appears to be some uncertainty regarding the
     -L    proper resistance which electromagnets for signalling-
                        — whether a receiving instrument should
purposes should have
have a resistance equal to that of the remainder of the circuit,
or a half, or a fifth, or some other fixed fraction thereof. Prac
tical experience, especially with high-speed instruments, has
shown that the resistances in general use are too high— and
that advantage is gained by reducing the resistance of an elec
tromagnetic receiving instrument, employing fewer windings
of a thicker wire in place of more windings of a thinner,
thereby reducing the self-induction as well.          Ohm, as long
ago   as  1826,   showed   that  the  resistance of a galvanometer
should equal that of the rest of the circuit in which it is placed,
to obtain the maximum magnetic force. When the correction
needed on account of the thickness of the insulating covering
of the wire is also reckoned, then the thickness of the wire of
the galvanometer should be such that the external resistance
is to the resistance of the galvanometer-coil as the diameter of
the covered wire is to the diameter of the wire itself (Maxwell,
vol. ii. p. 321).
     Now        in telegraphic signalling, sufficient time were
              if,
 allowed during every signal (positive, negative, or no cur
 rent) for the full effect to be produced in the circuit by the
 electromotive force, or for the current to entirely die away,
 the above result would hold good also.          But such    not the    is
 case ;  for by reason of electrostatic and electromagnetic induc
 tion, the current has not time to reach its full strength during
 ever)' signal.    On    land-line, unless
                            a                     very long, electro

 magnetic induction        the principal retarding cause and
                                 is                                     ;         it   is

  178              Mr. O. Heaviside on the Resistance
 neglecting a vanishing term.          The amplitude of the current-
 waves is thus reduced from
                                   E
                                   5
 (what it would be were there no retardation) to
 where    F  signifies the maximum current.          Or the current     is
 the same as if the resistance were increased in the ratio of
                         1:
 If   Lm is large compared with R, then F is small compared
with j, , or the diminution of current-strength is large.
     Let T be the time of a complete reversal.          Then
                                      2w
With     the Morse code, when T=^JJ second, or m=8(hr, an
automatic transmitter produces 100 words per minute, or a
little more.     Let      be between    yj^ and   ^   second,   then
                      ^
is between
               ^ and    STT, or (say) between 2'5 and 25      ; therefore
the current     will be reduced from 2'5 to 25 times.
    On telephonic circuits, owing to the great rapidity of the
reversals, the reduction in current-strength is great, and is
nearly inversely proportional to the pitch of the tone, thus
rendering it impossible to reproduce at the receiving end the
same quality of sound as is emitted at the sendingend, irre
spective of mechanical or acoustical difficulties.          The second
partial   tone  of  any  continuous   sound   will  be  weakened twice
as much as the first, the third thrice as much as the first,
and so on, thus producing a general deadness or want of
brilliancy.
    It also appears   from (2) that the resistance       of the circuit
becomes quite subordinate when           -5- is large ; and it may then
be greatly     increased without     much weakening        the current.
This is remarkably evident on telephonic circuits.              On auto
matic circuits it has sometimes been found beneficial to intro
duce resistance-coils at the receiving end.              The irregular
effects of leakage from neighbouring wires, which mutilate

                   of Telegraphic Electromagnets.                 179
 the proper signals, are reduced in a greater proportion than
 the proper signals themselves.
    3. Now let R and L belong to the electromagnet alone, and
 BI and Li be the resistance and electromagnetic capacity of
the remainder of the circuit.      Then (2) becomes
                                                  r               (3)
    In  solenoidal electromagnets, if n is the number of wind
ings   of the wire in unit oflength, and the number of layers in
unit of thickness, R varies as n*. L also varies as n*, while
the magnetizing force due to the unit current varies as n2.
Applying this to equation (3), if F is the magnetizing force,
F   is a maximum, n being variable, when
                                                                  (4)
RI and Li being considered constant,      as belonging to the line.
We may write (4) thus,
    Now ^i is constant for the same line-wire, whatever its
           fn
length, since both    Li and R! are proportional to the length of
the line.    Also p is constant for the same coil, if only the dia
meter of the wire is variable, since both      L  and  R vary as n*.
 But the time interval ~ for the electromagnet is in general
                                             I
much greater than the time interval              for the  line-wire
                                            ^                        :
whence it follows, by inspection of (5), that R must be much
 less than Ri to produce the maximum magnetizing force ; and
the higher the speed, which is proportional to m, the less
should R be.
    The calculation of   ^1 is easy,  since  the line-wire   is long,
                                                                    L
straight, and parallel to the earth    ; but the calculation of    -=
                                                                    11
is not so easy, owing to the variety of shapes assumed by elec
tromagnets used for telegraphic purposes, with their cores,
polepieces, and armatures, which all influence the electromag
netic capacity, though they do not influence the resistance.
It is therefore impossible to enunciate a general law, that the
                               N  2

180               Mr. O. Heaviside on the Resistance
resistance of an electromagnet should be such or such a frac
tion of the external resistance ; for the result will be different,
not only for every speed, but for every different construction
of the electromagnet.

a soft-iron armature placed close to it is proportional to the

186        Mr.  J. E. H. Gordon        on the Effect  of Variation of
to the lengths of sparks between flat plates.                 The extreme
length of spark used in his experiments was 1-52 millim.
     In the experiments made by M. Masson *, the spark passed
either between two balls in the air, or between two similar
balls inside a globe in which a more or less complete vacuum
could be produced. The distances between the balls could be
varied, as well as the pressures.            Within the limits of his ex
periments,      he   found    that the    length of spark was inversely
proportional to the pressure.              The greatest length of spark
which he used was          ll'l  millims.
     In 1843 M. Knochenhauerf worked with a constant length
                        f
of spark of about inch f, and measured the electric density re
quired to produce a spark in air at various pressures. Within
tie limits of his experiments he found that the ratio of the elec
tric density required to produce a spark, to the pressure of the
air, increases sensibly as the pressure diminishes.              Now it is a
simple deduction from Harris's law that the length of spark
is proportional to the electric density; and therefore Knochen-
hauer s results show that the law given by Harris and Masson
does not hold for all distances and pressures.
     Wiedemann and Ruhemann§ found a purely empirical for
mula for variations in the lengths of sparks where the longest
                                                                              •
spark was 9-95 millims.
     In the experiments described in this paper, an attempt has
been made to determine the ratio of the spark-length to the
pressure for distances ranging from 6 inches to 30 mches by
moans of one and the same apparatus.                The experiments also
differ from any former experiments with which the author is
acquainted, in the fact that an induction-coil was used as the
source of electricity instead of an electric machine.

      The Coil. — This was a particularly fine instrument, giving
a spark of 17 inches (42'5 centims.) in air at the ordinary
pressure.       It was worked by 10 quart cells of Grove's battery
arranged      in series.     It was provided with a vibrator and with
a clock contact-breaker, either of which could be used.

 Pressure on    the   Length of Disruptive Discharge in      Air.    187
was arranged so that more pipes than are usually provided for
could be attached to it.      Its base being removed, the bolt
which had held it to the base passed through a hole in the
table ; and the nut being screwed up the pump was firmly fixed.
   The Discharging Tubes. —These consisted of two cylindrical
glass tubes about 4 feet (1-33 metre) long and nearly 3 inches
diameter. At one end of each was a tap, the brass pipe from
which ended in a ball which formed one of the discharging
terminals.    Holes in the side of the brass pipe admitted the air
from the tap to the tube. At the other end was a stuffing-box,
in which a brass rod slid ; at the end of the brass rod was a
point which could either be placed in contact with the ball or
withdrawn some 3 feet from it. The end of the rod was kept
always in the axis of the tube by means of three little glass
arms, which were stuck into an ebonite collar fixed on the
discharging rod a little behind the point.    The two tubes were
supported in a horizontal position, parallel to each other and
about 18 inches apart, on four ebonite legs about 18 inches high.
The tubes were joined to the air-pump by means of the pipes and
taps shown in the figure (Plate III.), which were so arranged
that the tubes could be at once connected to each other, to the
external air, to a gas-holder, or to the pump.      Between the
tubes and the pump the metal pipe was cut, and a piece of
glass tubing about 18 inches long, well varnished with shellac,
was inserted, so that the electricity might not pass to earth
through the pump*.
   When the tubes were shut off from the pump, air could
always be let into the glass pipe to prevent the discharge pass
ing to earth inside     it,
                         as    would do at low pressures.
                              it                              The
distance between the point and ball in each tube was measured
as follows.    They were placed in contact, and an ink mark
was made on the discharging rod just outside the collar of
the stuffing-box.    When the rod was slid out, the distance of
this mark from the collar was equal to the distance between
the point and ball.      The pressure was given by      U-gauge,
                                                             a
about  4   feet high, attached to the air-pump at one end, open
to the air at the other.
   The pressure   P  was given by the formula
  P=   {height of barometer} — {difference of level of mercury
                                in the two arms of the      .       U}
  Before being admitted into the tubes, the air was dried                by
being drawn through sulphuric acid. When         was desired

188     Mr.   J. E. H. Gordon     on the Effect of Variation of
that the pressure of the air in the tube should equal that of the
external atmosphere, air bubbled through the acid as long as
the difference of pressure inside and outside the tube exceeded
that of the inch of acid which had to be displaced, and then
the tap was opened direct to the outside air. The external
diameters of the tubes were about 2'94 and 2-76 inches respec
tively, and the diameters of the balls '94 and '92 inch.
                          The Experiments.
   In  the experiments which are the subject of the present
paper, one of the tubes (A) was left open to the atmosphere,
and its discharging point placed at a standard distance either
6, 8, or 10 inches from the ball ; and the other tube (B) being
nearly exhausted, experiments were commenced at the low
pressure, and then a little air was let in between each observa
tion. The tubes were so connected to the coil that the dis
charge would pass in whichever tube offered least resistance.
The discharging-distanco in B was then varied and adjusted to
the shortest distance, which caused the whole discharge to pass
in A. The distance between the points of B being noted, the
points were then brought nearer together till they reached the
longest distance at which the whole discharge passed in B.
The moan of these two distances was taken as the distance
which, at the pressure then being worked with, interposed in B
a resistance equal to that of the standard length in A of air at
the pressure of the atmosphere.
   Let us call this mean " mean B spark."          Now, if the law
that the spark is inversely proportional to the pressure holds,
we should have for the same series of experiments,
            {mean   B spark} (pressure in B} = const.      ;
and to compare different sets made with different distances in
A and with the barometer at different heights, we should have
          {mean   B spark}    {pressure  in B}
                                                   = const.
                  in A} {height of barometer}
       {distance
If  the two tubes     and the discharging points were precisely
alike, this  constant  would be unity.      Any slight difference in
the shape of the points and balls, however, would cause it to
differ from unity, but would not affect its constancy.
   The Table (pp. 190, 191), which explains itself, gives the
results of several sets of experiments arranged in ascending
order of pressures.
   The results which    I  deduce from it are : —
   (1) From a pressure of about 11 inches up to that of the

   Pressure on the Length of Disruptive Discharge in          Air.    189
atmosphere Harris's law approximately holds good. No va
riation from it indicating any other law is observed.
    (2) No law can be said to be more than approximately true ;
for when the density has almost reached the discharging limit,
any slight accidental circumstance, such as the presence of a
grain of dnst, a little burning of the point by the last dis
charge, &c., will cause the discharge to take place.            Professor
Clerk Maxwell has compared the experiment to the splitting
of a piece of wood by a wedge.            It is possible to determine
the average pressure on the wedge which will split the wood ;
but in any particular experiment it is impossible to say that
the wood will split exactly at that pressure.
     (3) When the pressure is diminished below 11 inches, the
product in column VII. rapidly diminishes.             This shows that
at low pressures the spark produced by a given electromotive
force is much shorter than is required by Harris's law, or that
the electromotive force required to produce a spark of given
length is at low pressures greater than that required by Harris's
law.      This agrees with what Mr. De La Rue has told me,
namely that he finds that at all pressures, however low, the
discharge is disruptive, and none of it passes by conduction.
If   any portion could at low pressures pass by conduction, wo
might expect that a smaller and not a greater electromotive
force would be required than that calculated by Harris's law
 from experiments at high pressures.
     It is also not inconsistent with the result of Sir William
 Thomson's historical experiments (mentioned above) "On the
Electromotive Force required to produce a Spark."                  For he
             " Greater electromotive force
writes*,                                         per unit length of air
 is required to produce a spark at short distances tlum at long"
 For the words in italics substitute " at low pressures than at
                               I
high." We may then both write " with a low air resistance
than with a high one," or " with few air particles between the
 points than with many." Sir William Thomson says of his
 result,
           " it is difficult even to conjecture an explanation ;"        I
 can only say the same of mine.
     I cannot say exactly at what pressure M. Knochenhauer's
 experiments show a change in the law —as he evidently con
 siders the change to be due partly at least to experimental
 errors, and introduces corrections, some of which are appa
 rently suggested by peculiarities in his apparatus, while others
 are intended to adjust the experimental results to the supposed
 law. As far as          I can see, the change was first beyond the
 reach of his corrections when the barometer fell to about 2
  inches.

THE

external influences acting only upon the surface, supposing
that friction takes place in the liquid (as it does in water and
all other known liquids to a greater or a less amount).

the external forces ; p is the pressure, p the density, k the
coefficient of friction of the liquid, and A the symbol for the
sum of the three partial differential quotients of the second
order according to *, y, and z.
   The surface-conditions can be expressed most simply thus : —
(1) The particles of the surface of the liquid will always remain
in contact with those of the adjacent body ; that       both must                  is,
have the same velocity-components perpendicular to the sur
face.   Naming these and rt, then must at any time

gaseous,   the necessity  that  the pressure  normal   to the surface
be equal on both sides, because otherwise the connexion ex-
          by the preceding equation would be broken. (2) The

liquid and the contiguous body, the equation
                                     T=\(t1-t)
will subsist, in which X is the constant of the external friction,
depending only on the nature of the two bodies in contact.       If
wetting of a part of the surface takes place, we must there put
t=t1} consequently            \=     oo .
  Let the liquid be spread over a solid, plane.                               Of external
forces gravitation only acts perpendicular to this plane.                              Let
its direction be the positive X-direction ; then is
                               X=g,           Y=Z = 0.
   Let the solid plane be wetted, so that the liquid particles
adjacent to it always remain at rest.   This requires that for
them u = v = to = 0 always. The body in contact with the other
surface will at every point have equal velocity and in the same
direction, but in general dependent on the time. If the initial
motion of the liquid was parallel to that of the contiguous
medium, or was also =0, then, in accordance with the second
surface-condition, only motions in the same direction can at
any time take place.   Consequently, if we place the plane of
XZ parallel to this direction, v is always =0. The differen
tial equations then become

The velocity in the surface becomes
                                    ph
and, when    h is very great, changes into  wt itself.  Accordingly
1C  can also be  Written
                          W
                                  h-x
                             = W0—f  --
    This simple equation solves the important question how the
velocity is distributed in a very extensive sheet of water of
uniform depth, which is in stationary motion under the influ
ence of winds acting constantly on its surface.        It shows that,
if the bottom stratum is at rest, motions in the direction of the
wind take place in the rest of the strata, with velocities that
increase proportionally to the elevation (h — x) above the bot
tom, from 0 to the value w0 in the surface.        The question put
by various authors, mostly geographers, To what depth does
the influence of the trade-wind reach? is therefore to be
answered thus : — So far as the motion of the ocean under that
influence may be regarded as stationary, it extends to the bot
tom of the sea, and even the deeper strata obey it according
to the measure given by the above law, provided that no other
causes (e. a. displacement-currents) put these strata into other
motion.     In the case of the deeper strata being kept by an
extraneous cause in motion in exactly the opposite direction
 to that of the upper strata, there must exist between them a
plane where the velocity is =0.        If this be considered as the
lower boundary plane of the upper bed, and its distance from
the upper surface be denoted by hi, for the motion in the upper
 mass the following equation holds good : —
     The distribution of the velocity in the upper mass is there
  fore the same as  if the lower were a solid mass.
     The velocity found for stationary motion is dependent on
 the friction-coefficient k only through w0 (a dependence which
 vanishes when h is very great); it will consequently diminish
 with the depth according to the same law in a very viscous
 liquid as in a very mobile one.      In stationary motion the in
 fluence of friction appears solely in the participation of all the
 strata in the motion which is communicated from without to
 the upper surface only.
     Dependence on the coefficient of friction first comes in with
 the consideration of periodically variable motions, and gives
  (to use a favourite expression with many writers) a measure

            in reference    to the Theory'    of Ocean; Currents.         197

    The general solution of the differential equation (1), with
the accessory conditions            (2), (3), (4), was given by Poisson*.
It can be derived more               elegantly according to the method
(probably originated by Dirichlet) which, in Riemann's Lec
tures on Partial Differential Equations, p. 140, is applied to
the somewhat simpler problem when there is no free radiation,
but a given temperature at the surface*
    The function w may be composed of two functions u and v,
which satisfy the general differential equation (1) for w, and
fulfil the following conditions : —
        For x = 0.                      For x = h.        For t = 0.

    The velocity in the surface-stratum is obtained from equa
 tion (12) by putting therein «=0: —

    The second     part of this expression approximates, for in
 creasing time, to the reciprocal of p -Strut, and therewith to 0
 Putting this in words, it means : —The velocity of the surface-
 stratum continually approaches nearer to that of the conti
 guous medium.
    This necessary inference of the theory, however, draws a
 limit to its applicability to the theory of ocean-currents. Ex
 perience teaches that nowhere do the surface-waters of the sea
 take the mean velocity of the masses of air blowing over them,
 because, when the wind is rather high, periodic motions of
 those strata (waves) arise, on the sides of which the wind acts
 in quite another manner, namely by pressure on the side-
 surfaces, so that, with still more augmented difference of ve
 locity between air and water, breaches of connexion take place,
 discontinuous, turbulent movements.          Therefore the surface-
 condition above laid down can only for very inconsiderable
 velocities correspond to the reality ; for greater velocities the
 water-surface as a whole cannot fulfil it. In this case it is

202            M. K. Zoppritz on         some   Hydrodynamie Problems
better to introduce into the problem the progressive motion of
the superficial stratum of the ocean (which, indeed, can every
where be easily determined by observation) as a given quantity,
as a known function of the time (eventually as a constant).
Thereby a much simpler problem is obtained, which can be
mathematically deduced from the foregoing, if in this we put
p=co . The surface-condition then reads, for x = 0, w=<f>(t);
and the transcendental equation is transformed into sin mh = 0*

k contains as unit the square centimetre      ; therefore x must also
be expressed in centimetres, and be put        = 10000.  We thus get

which gives the value of      t in seconds, and we find
              t= 7,537,000,000     seconds   = 239 years  ;
so that,  if the particles of the surface of an ocean of very great
(properly infinite) depth, at rest, begins at a point of time
<=0 to move forward with a constant velocity, half the velo
city of the surface will first prevail at 100 metres depth after
239 years.
    If we inquire,  After how long      a time has a tenth part of the
surface-velocity penetrated      to  100 metres depth ? we find it is
41 years.      According to the principle expressed in equation
(15), at 10 metres depth the same velocities will prevail at the
end of 2'39 years and 0'41 year respectively.
   These numbers are very appropriate for giving an idea of
the slowness with which changes of velocity are propagated
downward ; for what has just been calculated for the propa
gation of a commencing surface-movement in a liquid at rest
is just as valid for every change of motion in a moving liquid,
since the velocity already present and that which has newly
entered are algebraically added together.           A stationary cur
rent diminishing in velocity linearly with the depth will on
this account be only extremely little altered by passing changes
of velocity affecting its surface (as, for example, by head
winds or storms), except in the strata nearest to the surface.
 There will much rather prevail at every deeper-situated point
a mean velocity but very slightly variable with the time, and
determined by the mean velocity at the surface.             The latter
velocity has the direction of the prevailing winds, and falls and
rises with them according to a law which cannot be more pre
cisely determined. This fact of the limitation of considerable
action of transitory causes to the strata in the vicinity of the
surface is an additional justification of the assumption, made
to facilitate the calculation, that the ocean is of infinite depth.
    If the velocity of the surface is a periodic function of the
time, as are all winds dependent on the seasons of the year
and hours of the day, it must be possible to express them by
a finite series of the form

which contain exact multiples, while the remaining sines assume
the value ±1.       We then get, for t = 10,000 years, exactly,
within 0-001,
                                                    -*
                                                       = 0-037 w0.
     Since after an infinite time the velocity 0'5w0 must prevail
at this place, it is evident how inconsiderable a portion of the
definitive velocity has penetrated to such a depth only after
10,000 years. On the other hand, for t = 100,000 years w,
becomes
                                            -0-461 W*
Therefore the velocity has, after 100,000 years, already arrived
very near to the definitive value ; after 200,000 years it differs
from it only 0-002.
     From the foregoing theoretical considerations two results
especially are obtained, which more or less contradict views
hitherto accepted : — first, that the stationary motion proceed
ing from an invariable surface- velocity makes itself perceptible
with linearly diminishing velocity right to the bottom in an
unlimited sheet of water, while the view has frequently been
expressed that the influence of such surface-currents (as, for
instance, the impulse generated in the equatorial regions of
the ocean by the trade-wind) extends downward to only very
limited depths.     Secondly, we have found that all periodic or

             in reference  to the   Theory of Ocean Currents.          207
aperiodic variable changes in the forces acting upon the
surface are propagated into the depths with extreme slow
ness, the periodic with very rapidly diminishing amplitude.
From the combination of these two propositions it follows that
the motion of the main body of a sheet of water subject to
periodically variable surface-forces is determined by the mean
velocity of the surface, and that the periodic changes are per
ceptibly only in a proportionally very thin superficial stratum.
    It is hence obvious that hitherto the influence of the fric
tion has in one direction been underrated, and overrated in
another :— underrated, inasmuch as it has been believed that
that influence could not be regarded as penetrating to such
depths ; overrated, inasmuch as it has been customary to attri
bute to friction much too considerable an influence in regard
to the propagation of the motions of variable currents.                  Its
action has been still more overrated in another direction, of
which the following investigation will give some explanation.
     Up to the present time the liquid layer was presupposed un
 limited in two dimensions ; but the case of laterally bounded
currents is also capable of treatment*, and therewith the influ
ence of the sides (the shores) upon the flow can be recognized.
     Let the liquid have again the depth h, but be bounded by
 two parallel perpendicular sides with the distance 26 between
 them, which are wetted by the liquid, and at which, therefore,
 the velocity is =0.         If the X-axis be situated as before, but
 the axis of    Y  placed perpendicular to the two sides, and the
 point of origin in the centre of the upper-surface line of the
 cross section, then the velocity w parallel to the sides is given
 by the differential equation

       for y=b,                w=0     ;         fory=—b,       w=0.
     For the case of stationary motion (which            shall exclusively
  be further pursued here), we have

   The stationary state here also is independent of the friction-
coefficient.
   It follows, moreover, from these considerations, that, in a
liquid layer of constant depth, two currents parallel to the
same straight line, but flowing in opposite directions, can well
be adjacent without disturbing one another.           Their dividing
surface is then a vertical plane parallel to their directions, in
which the velocity is 0, and which behaves exactly like a solid
bank. As long as the forces brought forth by each of the cur
rents continue unchanged, the motions of both remain sta
tionary, and neither current disturbs the other.
   The complete analogy shown by the distribution of velocity
in a mass of liquid possessing friction, with the heat-distribu
tion in a solid body, gives a hint to pursue it also in another
direction.    It has already been shown above, how extraordi
narily slowly the velocity present at the surface is propagated
into the depths, provided here the velocity 0 has previously
prevailed.    From this it can be conversely inferred that the
after-effect of the initial state vanishes with the same slowness.
This is represented by the hitherto neglected first term of the
formulae (8), (11), and (13).         If  in them we put for/(f) a
constant   or a linear  function  of f,  the integral according to £
can be at once carried out, and the entire term dependent on
the initial state becomes in all three formula; a sum of the
same form as that which was obtained for the term dependent
on i/>(X) when i/>(\) was put = a constant.         Since the expo
nents of e are the same in both cases, the above calculated
numbers are valid for the vanishing of the initial state.
   If, for example, about 10,000 years ago (therefore at a
period of which we have no historic information), by any
cosmic event the equilibrium of the sea was so considerably
disturbed that strong currents resulted therefrom, the influence
of the then existing motions would certainly not yet have
totallv disappeared from the present condition of the currents
— incfeed it would at the present time predominantly deter
mine the motion of the ocean in its greater depths — if the
earth were entirely covered with an ocean of the uniform depth
of 4000 metres. The interruption of the continuity of the
ocean by continents and island-masses of irregular shape will
contribute to soften down considerably that after-effect of pre
vious states of motion, not so much by the increased friction
on the sea-bed as by the reflex and displacement currents
everywhere breaking in. Nevertheless, after the above nume
rical proof of the slow spread of the influence of locally acting
changes of motion penetrating the mass, a caution is necessary
not to put aside the difficulty of more accurate calculation, as is

          Motions in Dilute Acids on Amalgam Surfaces,           211
usual, by saying    "All   these motions are rapidly consumed     by
friction."
    It would be possible to determine by observations whether
any after-effects of former motions are still present in the
ocean.     For this purpose it would only be necessary to insti
tute comparative observations of the currents at the most va
rious depths in the central portions of the great equatorial
currents and the region of calms.           Yet we could not hope to
demonstrate small remnants of former motions with a certainty
like that with which this is possible in relation to the after
effect of the former higher temperature of the earth by mea
surements of subterranean temperatures.
    Further, those above-calculated numbers give a hint how
remote, at the least, we have to imagine the initial state to
have been from the present time, or for how long a period, at
the least, we must imagine that the trade-winds have blown
in their present extent and strength, to justify the assumption
that the present state of motion of the equatorial currents is
approximately stationary.        For this about 100,000 years are
required if we take for a basis a mean sea-depth of 4000 metres
and take no account of the damping influence of the conti
nents and islands, which must somewhat lessen that number.
    That every initial state, however, finally vanishes, and, from
the simple law of distribution laid down, gives place to a sta
tionary one, is evident from the form of the series for w, and
has, besides, been shown generally for all temperature-problems
by K. von der Miihll*.

 XXVII.      Motions produced by Dilute Acids on some Amalgam
                  Surfaces. By ROBERT SABiNEf.
 IN     the December (1876) Supplementary Number of the
       Philosophical Magazine       I  stated an opinion, supported
 by experimental evidence, that the motions which Erman,
 Draper, and others have observed in certain electrolytic liquids
 when in contact with mercury surfaces, and in the circuit of
 an electric current, are due to displacements caused by oxida
 tion and deoxidation at different points.
                                                  I
     In following up the subject since, have made further
 experiments, and have noticed some phenomena which are in
 teresting (although perhaps of no practical value), to which, I
 believe, attention has not hitherto been directed.

212           Mr. R. Sabine on Motions produced by
    Exp. 1. A rather rich amalgam of lead was filtered through
a paper funnel into a clean shallow dish, so as to produce as
bright a surface as the nature of the amalgam would allow.
 Then a drop of very dilute nitric acid was carefully placed
upon it by means of a pipette. The acid-drop did not lie still
 (as it would do upon a surface of pure mercury), but set itself
at once into a jerky motion. It gradually contracted its area
and then suddenly spread out again, then gradually contracted
again, and again suddenly spread, the pulsations being irre
gular.     That portion of the amalgam surface which was ex
posed by the contraction of the drop was very bright and
smooth, and appeared to be free from floating particles of
foreign metal which roughened the surface at other points.
    In a repetition of the experiment with weaker acid, the drop
was observed to march bodily over the amalgam surface, going
from one side to the other, and sometimes returning.
    Dilute sulphuric, hydrochloric, oxalic, and acetic acids be
haved similarly to nitric acid, but in somewhat different
degrees.
    Amalgams of tin, antimony, zinc, and copper behaved simi
larly to lead amalgam, but also in different degrees.
    It was found that, in order to produce these motions, the
acid must be sufficiently diluted to avoid the perceptible for
 mation of gas.     The extent to which the dilution might be
carried appeared to depend upon the richness and nature of
the amalgam.       Weak motions were observed with the fol
lowing : —
          Amalgam of                       1 oz. water to
            Copper                    1  drop nitric acid.

            Tin                       8    „
            Lead                     15    ..        „
    Exp. 2. Instead of the foregoing metals, which in very di
 lute nitric acid appear to be all positive to mercury, amalgams
 of platinum, gold, and silver were next tried, these metals being
 all negative to mercury.       On placing the acid-drop on the
clean newly filtered surface, no motion whatever was observed.
When a trace of positive metal, however, was added, slight
motions were observed.
    Exp. 3. A dish containing lead amalgam having a drop of
 dilute nitric acid on its surface was placed under a small glass
 receiver.    The motions of the acid-drop were observed to be
 irregular, the edge darting out first in one direction and then
 in another. The air in the receiver was changed by the steady

           Dilute Acids on     some   Amalgam Surfaces.        213
injection of oxygen ; and it was observed that the motions im
mediately became more rapid and, at the same time, more
regular all round.  When the supply of oxygen was stopped
and atmospheric air substituted, the motions resumed their
original irregularity.
    Exp.  4. The foregoing experiment was repeated by allow
ing drop of acid water on the amalgam surface to fall into
     a
motion underneath the receiver, and then changing the atmo
sphere to one of hydrogen.     The motions immediately ceased.
On letting in the air again, the motions were resumed.        In
carbonic acid, nitrogen, and coal-gas the motions were in
stantly arrested ; and by covering the amalgam surface under
the receiver alternately with one of these gases and with either
atmospheric air or oxygen, the motions could be stopped and
reestablished at pleasure.
   Exp, 5. On a surface of lead amalgam a drop of dilute nitric
acid was placed, and the tip of a lead wire suspended in the
drop.    Between the lead wire and the amalgam was inserted
a delicate reflecting galvanometer.   By means of an adjustable
shunt across the galvanometer, the first current was reduced
until the index fell nearly to zero. Then the shunt resistance
was increased so as to obtain the greatest sensitiveness, whilst
retaining the light point upon the scale.      In this position,
whilst Mr. McEniry observed the motions of the acid-drop,        I
observed the motions of the galvanometer, each giving a signal.
In this way it was found that each spreading of the drop was
accompanied by a slight excursion of the light-point.       The
direction of the permanent deflection showed that the amalgam
surface was positive to the lead wire. The direction of the
excursions indicated a slight diminution of this permanent
current, or that at the moment of expansion of the acid-
drop, the amalgam surface became slightly less electropositive.
In the intervals between the expansions, the tendency was for
the needle to move in the other direction.   Lead is positive to
mercury in dilute nitric acid ; therefore this reduced electro-
positiveness may indicate an increased proportion of mercury
on the covered surface at the instant of spreading.
   The conclusion which    I   draw from these experiments      is,
that the motions in question are due to a portion of the surface
of the amalgam becoming alternately oxidized by the air out
side the acid-drop, and deoxidized by electrolysis in the inte
rior of the drop. The reciprocal play of these two actions      is,
I venture to suggest, as follows: — When the acid-drop    placed
                                                          is
upon the surface of the amalgam of metal specifically lighter
                                        a
than mercury,  it  finds the surface to consist of mercury in
which are floating innumerable particles of the foreign metal.

214          Mr. R. Sabine on Motions produced by
The latter, in rich amalgams, are distinctly visible to the eye,
producing a somewhat roughened surface.             Electric currents
are generated between the mercury and the particles of foreign
metal, through the acid. When the foreign metal is positive
to mercury, the latter (which by contact with the air is always
more or less oxidized) becomes deoxidized underneath the drop
of dilute acid and therefore cleaned.          The drop has less affi
nity   for the clean than   it had   for the oxidized surface. Its
adhesion is therefore diminished ; and it draws itself together
in consequence, leaving a surrounding ring of deoxidized
mercury, in which the eye can detect few or no floating par
ticles of foreign metal ruffling the smoothness of the surface.
 Oxidation of this exposed clean portion of mercury, however,
gradually sets in; and when the mercury up to the boundary
line of the drop is sufficiently reoxidized, the acid reasserts its
affinity for the oxide, and the drop is enabled to spread out
again to its original dimensions. Interior deoxidation then goes
on again by means of the small surface couples ; and the play
 of alternate contraction by reduced adhesion, due to deoxida
 tion, and spreading by affinity for the oxide formed by the
 outer atmosphere, is kept up so long as positive metal and acid
 last.
     The contraction due to deoxidation by the current would
 necessarily be slower than the spreading due to chemical affi-
.nity between the acid and oxidized surface.
     In explanation of the acid-drop travelling bodily over the
                       I
  amalgam surface, would suggest that       if,  from any reason, the
  oxidation were more energetic at one side of the drop than at
  the other,it  must lose equilibrium and go on travelling in the
  direction of the more energetic action, because the mercury
  surface on that side of the drop would be ready oxidized, whilst
  on the opposite it  would be continually left deoxidized.
     Supposing that the foregoing explanation       is   the right one,
  there are two points well worthy of noting.          First,
                                                            it    would
  follow that the electropositive metal    in the amalgam  is   to some
  extent electrically independent of the mercury — asserts, in
  fact, a certain electrical integrity.     Secondly,it   would be ne
  cessary that the electromotive force between the foreign metal
  and mercury (say lead and mercury) when in very dilute acid
  must be greater, or at least have  a   greater decomposing action,
. when the one metal       in
                           is   astate of minute subdivision and its
  particles in intimate electric contact with the other metal, than
  we should be led to expect from the behaviour of the metals
 in separate masses.
   An analogy appears to exist between this behaviour and the
 augmentation of chemical affinity of the couples constructed

                  Dilute Acids on           some   Amalgam Surfaces.           215
by Dr. Gladstone and Mr. Tribe by the deposition of a nega
tive upon a positive metal, described by them at the British-
Association Meeting at Bristol in 1875.
    Connected with the same subject, but susceptible probably
of a different explanation, is the following experiment : —
    On a clean dry surface of rich lead amalgam a drop of strong
nitric acid is placed.    The acid spreads itself out, the amalgam
surface underneath        in the course of a second or two, assu
                                 it,
ming  a   dull leaden-grey colour. Suddenly, with flash, this              a
colour changes to        whitish tint, which gradually deepens
                             a
again in colour until, after another second or two, another
flash restores the whitish tint.    This alternation of colour                  is
sometimes repeated steadily many times in succession during
several minutes, until an energetic action at length sets in ana
gas is  evolved.
    The change from grey to white      always abrupt the change
                                                    is                 ;
from white to grey always gradual.
    Instead of employing a vessel with lead amalgam, the flash
ing was equally well observed with the amalgamated surface
of a piece of common sheet-lead.       A galvanometer placed in
the circuit showed that at the instant of the flash the covered
surface became less electropositive.
    A quantity of lead amalgam placed in shallow dish and    a
completely covered with strong nitric acid showed changes of
colour as before.    At each flash.    was observed that the area
                                                   it
of the amalgam was suddenly contracted and               reexpanded
                                                             ;        it
during the change of colour from white to grey.
    A drop of strong nitric acid placed upon bright surface of   a
lead attacks       gradually, and produces
                    it                            dull grey colour
                                                             a
which    isslightly opalescent.
    A drop of strong nitric acid placed upon bright surface of   a
mercury attacks       energetically, producing white crystals and
                            it
evolving gas plentifully.
    The behaviour of the separate materials suggests an expla-
.natiou of what may happen in the case of the amalgam, viz.
 that while the surface       turning to grey colour, the nitric
                                       is                a
 acid    attacking lead and when        suddenly flashes white, the
     is is
                                  ;                 it
 acid    attacking mercury.      The  strange part of the phenc-
.menon      the apparent passivity of the mercury for some time
             is
 after placing the acid upon the amalgam. The explanation
 which appears to me to be the most probable                         is,
                                                        that the first
 contact of the acid with the amalgam surface results in the
 production of thin stratum of lead-salt, which floods the mer
                        a
 cury surface and tends to keep the nitric acid for a time sepa
 rated from        it
                   The acid in course of second or so, however,
                                                         a

Then a fresh diffusion ensues and the play is repeated.

nearly equally, through         all space.   This  is the initial point in
our history of creation, the earliest period which we know.
From this universal diffusion we can trace, by the operation
of well-known forces, the origin of the stars. We can under
stand how the vast sidereal systems, stellar nebulae, were
formed, and how they must remain stationary in space.                   We
can understand the origin of solar and planetary systems,
and how these latter systems are all moving through space
with inconceivable velocities. We can learn (as

that gravity is the force which imparted their velocities
to all the stars and to all stellar systems.                 And now             I
am to prove that in this same universal diffusion of all
matter we can behold the reservoir, the illimitable reservoir,
of that force which radiates the undulations of heat, light,
and actinism from all the stars.                    I
                                                    will point out also
that, in the condensation from that primitive                     diffusion,
we can behold the origin of those modifications of matter
which we call the simple elements.             In that condensation also
we can see the first manifestations of several of the physical
forces, such as electricity, magnetism, cohesion, heat, and light.
The three primitive forces, of whose origin we know nothing,
are repulsion, chemical force, and gravity.
   The diffusion of matter in a gaseous form, by the ordinary
•repulsive force, is a store of heat ; and this store is greater or
smaller in proportion to the amount of diffusion.               It is analo
gous  to  the   removal    of a  pound weight    from   the  surface  of the
earth : the further it is removed the greater will be the amount
of heat produced by its fall. It has been found that when our
atmospheric gases expand from one volume to two, their tem
perature is lowered, and just 144° F. of boat are absorbed and
rendered latent. Every addition of the original volume by
expansion renders latent an additional 144° of heat ; that                       is,

pears  as  repulsion    or  diffusion.   When    compressed      again,  that

               which causes the Stellar Radiations.            217
diffusion is annihilated, and the same original amount of heat
is reproduced. By a thermometer in the receiver of an air-
pump the loss of heat by expansion is seen clearly enough ;
but in the sinking of an oil-well recently in North-western
Pennsylvania it was manifest on a magnificent scale.       Instead
of striking a reservoir of oil, the auger entered an accumula
tion of gas (a hydrocarbon) ; and as this gas expanded on
issuing with amazing force from the orifice of the well, its own
heat was»converted into repulsion, and it absorbed the heat
from the surrounding atmosphere and from the ground.           The
watery vapour in the gas and in the air fell down as snow, and
the ground all around was frozen : it was like the freezing of
carbonic acid by its own expansion.
   From the well-ascertained fact that a gaseous diffusion ab
sorbs 144° F. of heat by every increase of its original volume,
which heat is converted into the form of repulsion, and is called
latent heat, we are enabled to calculate the amount of latent
heat in all the higher strata of our atmosphere.      A volume of
air rising three and a half miles (more accurately 3'43 miles)
becomes two volumes, and contains 144° of latent heat ; on
rising double that distance (6'8(; miles) it becomes 4 volumes ;
therefore 3 new volumes are added, and it contains 432° of
latent heat ; at 10'29 miles it becomes 8 volumes, and 7 new
volumes are added, and therefore it contains 1008° of latent
heat ; and so on upward, according to the following Table (p.
218), which (with other columns here omitted) was constructed
by Mr. Benjamin V. Marsh, merchant and, like Benjamin Frank
lin, an amateur of science in Philadelphia.      It first appeared
in the 'American Journal of Science,' July 1853. His paper
on many accounts is valuable ; and the subject is further car
ried out in my own paper on Meteors in the Proceedings of
the American Association for the Advancement of Science for
1871.
   The appearance of meteors is a proof that our atmosphere
extends   upwards more than 200 miles, and that its loftier
regions are wonderfully charged with latent heat.           In my
paper on Meteors    I gave two instances, one in Europe and the
other in America, where meteors travelled more than a thou
sand miles through the air from 40 to 100 miles high, and
continued vividly bright through the whole distance until they
passed from view.      Last year another passed in the same in
candescent    manner a thousand continuous miles over the
United States.    I also gave other instances of vertical descents,
when invariably the light of the meteors went out before reach
ing the ground. They prove that in these cases the very bright
light comes, not from the meteor itself, but from the air in its

front, which is compressed and made to give out its abundant
latent heat.          Had the meteors themselves been so vividly in
candescent, their brightness would have continued another
twiukling of an eye before they struck the earth.                           Had friction
been the cause of the heat, their light would have become
brighter in the dense lower atmosphere, where invariably their
light goes out, albeit gravity hastens their velocities.                          I  pointed
out in that paper the fallacies in the reasonings of high autho
rities who thought they had proved that meteoric light is due
to friction.

      The point of most intense interest in the Table of Marsh
 is the wonderfully large amount of latent heat in an almost
 infinitesimally small amount of the air. Look at the lower
 line in the Table j how immense is the physical force ! and how
 minute is the amount of matter ! and yet the two are physi
 cally coupled. Here is a wonder which leads to the very
 gravest consequences.                 It is an image of the sun. The amount
 of matter in that great orb is infinitesimally small when com

                 u-1tich causes the  Stellar Radiations.            219
pared with his physical force — that force which has sent out
the solar radiations many millions of millions of years.           Now
mark the origin of that solar force. When our sun in its ne
bulous period was expanded less than halfway to the nearest
fixed star (« Centauri), it was 666,000,000,000,000,000 times
more rare than hydrogen.           It was more rare than the highest
strata of our atmosphere ; and its repulsive force, latent heat,
was in greater proportion than in the last line of the Table of
Marsh.      That force is indestructible.          It cannot be lost.
 During    the  condensation     of  the  sun  it must  be stored up in
the solar elements, and pass off as solar radiation.            I speak
not now of the falling together of the materials of the sun by
the force of gravity, and the consequent liberation of heat from
that source. That is exceedingly small, not worth counting, al
though it might continue the solar radiations 20,000,000 years.
     But in the repulsive force which so vastly expanded the
nebulous sun we behold only one of the sources of its present
power. There was still another and a greater power then resi
ding in our nebulous sun. It was a power great enough to
overcome the repulsive force, to condense the nebulous sun to
 his present liquid condition, and to store up all that infinity of
 latent heat in the chemical elements of the sun. This para
 mount and overcoming power was the chemical force. When
 all matter was diffused through all space, its condensation
 could not have been caused from the loss of its heat by radia
 tion — in common phrase, by " the cooling of the primitive fire
 mist'."   If all space had been thus filled by sensible heat (" fire
 mist)," then that heat must have remained. It could not radiate
 away ; for there was no other space where it could go. There
  fore we must look to some other well-known cause for the
  condensation of the primitive solar gases.            The only other
  cause we can think of is chemical action ; and that is an ad
  equate, a normal, and a familiar cause.          The chemical force,
  indeed, is the great condensing-power in the universe. Oxygen
  and hydrogen, when under its influence, are rapidly condensed
  nearly 2000 times in volume to form water : but the repul
  sive force of these gases is not lost ; it is converted partly into
  heat and light, and partly into cohesion.
     We will now attend to some well-known facts to illustrate
  how the chemical force may overcome the repulsive force, and
  imprison in a dense solid or a liquid vast stores of many kinds
  of physical forces.      Gunpowder, nitroglycerine, dynamite, and
  mercurial fulminating powders are examples.               In all these
  cases the original repulsive force has been overcome and ap
  propriated by the chemical force.         As being most familiar, we
  will confine our analysis to gunpowder.           Its power is stored

 220           Mr.  J.  Ennis on  the  Origin of the Power
 up in its chemical force, and in the repulsion of its three gases,
 oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid.             These gases were
 floating  about  in  the air until  the  chemical  force laid hold on
 them,  and   pressed them down      into the small  solid materials of
 the powder.      The nitrogen and oxygen were quietly combined
 as nitric acid, and then united with, the potassa of the earth,
 forming nitrate of potassa, or saltpetre.      The gaseous carbonic
 acid was absorbed through the stomata of plants, then dissolved,
 and its carbon hardened into wood, or rather the charcoal of
 the wood.      This saltpetre and charcoal, with a very little sul
 phur, are the only components of gunpowder. We know how
 the least spark liberates these imprisoned gases ; and how ter
 ribly their native repulsive power shows itself, not only with
 thundering sound, but with the power of thunder, and with
 the heat  of lightning.
    The materials of gunpowder show this power, not only in
the thunder-like explosion and the lightning-like heat, but
also in vast stores of chemical force.        One of the elements of
saltpetre, composed of oxygen and nitrogen, is the violent
aqua fortis, or nitric acid.        Two other gases, hydrogen and
 chlorine, are combined     and  condensed by chemical force into
a very different material called hydrochloric acid.         These two
acids when combined show their power by dissolving gold as
a lump of sugar is dissolved in a cup of tea.          Hydrogen and
nitrogen    also  are  combined and condensed by the chemical
force into the violent ammoniacal gas.          This ammonia com
bines with the nitric acid, and the two are hardened by the
chemical force into a solid, the nitrate of ammonia. All these
are striking instances of the way the repulsive force may be
overcome and converted into the chemical force, this chemical
force being lodged in vast abundance in small amounts of the
resulting solids and liquids.        How inert and comparatively
feeble are the chemical properties of the four gases which
form aqua regia (oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and chlorine) !
But the force residing in them in the form of repulsion is
great beyond expression, beyond measurement.             Think of the
wonderful mechanical force lately found necessary to reduce
them to a liquid condition — still retaining their repulsion and
ever ready to burst out into their native gaseous state. As they
can be so easily reduced to the solid condition by the chemical
force, this is an impressive illustration of the great power of the
chemical force in overcoming and appropriating to itself the
repulsive force.       The great idea here conveyed is that the
repulsive force of these gases cannot be annihilated.         It com
pletely disappears as repulsion when these gases are solidified
or liquified ; but it is converted into the chemical force.

               which causey the Stellar Radiations.             221
   Two great ideas are now clearly proved.       First, the incon
ceivably large amount of repulsive force coupled with every
single infinitesimally small portion of the sun when in the ne
bulous condition, as illustrated by the last line of the Table of
Marsh.     Secondly, the still greater amount of chemical force
then residing in the nebulous sun, which overcame the repul
sive force and compressed the sun to his present size — as illus
trated by that same force when it compresses oxygen and
nitrogen into nitric acid, and when it compresses oxygen and
hydrogen into water — in the case of nitric acid, retaining a
vast store of chemical force, and, in the case of water, produ
cing a large amount of heat and also of cohesion, as         I will
soon show.
   Both these stores of original force, the repulsive and the
chemical, must now reside in the compressed sun, the same as
great stores of force reside in compressed gunpowder.          And
no finite mind can pretend to say how long that reservoir of
solar force may be able to send out the radiations from the sun.
Count up millions of years as we may, we cannot begin to
touch the problem. We stand before its immensity bowed in
reverence, as when we contemplate the infinity of space and
the eternity of time.
   In this condensation of the nebulous stars, our sun included,
we behold the origin of the so-called simple chemical elements.
These are not eternal entities.    They are mere modifications
of the primitive gaseous diffusion, formed successively as con
densation went on.     The proofs    I cannot epitomize here, as
                                                       '
they  are already condensedly stated in my volume, The Origin
of the Stars,' where they occupy nearly the entire Second
Part, more than forty pages. In the meteorites there are only
about 22 chemical elements, the same monotonous catalogue,
more or less complete, coming down at every meteoric fall.
 In our Earth, after a longer condensation and a more powerful
 chemical action, the catalogue became extended to 63. In
the Sun, after a still longer and more powerful action, the
number of simple elements, judging from the fixed lines, must
be several hundreds or several thousands.       All the stars have
different sets of fixed lines, showing that the modifications of
matter which we call chemical elements are infinite in number.
 The same is seen in the planets.     Mercury is nine times more
 dense than Saturn; and therefore the two are composed mainly
of different elements.    Greater heat might indeed expand the
elements of Saturn more than those in Mercury, but not so
much as nine times. This is impossible. All solids and liquids
fly off into vapour long before even a double expansion.
 Moreover there is no estimating the millions of years which
 Saturn had to cool before the origin of Mercury.

222            Mr. J. Ennis on   the Origin of  the Power
    In that  same Part I collected many facts to show the hete
rogeneity    of matter, and how the peculiar elements of the Sun
may possess many thousand times more chemical force than
those in our Earth, and thus continue through periods illimit
able to burn and to impart solar radiations. The same is true of
the facts "dissociation," which have been insisted on so much.
The oxide of gold is dissociated with truly an insignificant
amountofheat; the oxide of mercury requires only a littlemore;
but the dioxide of carbon requires many tens of thousand
times more heat for its dissociation, if indeed such dissociation
by heat be at all possible.      The peculiar elements of the sun
may require we know not how much more.               To say that the
great heat of the sun must necessarily dissociate its elements,
is to say what we do not know, and that in the face of the
strongest reasons to the contrary.
   I said there are three primitive forces whose origin is unknown
— repulsion, chemical force, and gravity. But we perceive that
 from the operation of these three all the other special forces
become manifest, through the great principle of the conversion
of force. From the chemical force in ordinary burning come
light and heat ; from the same force in the galvanic battery
 come electricity and magnetism.        The great force of cohesion
is no exception. In the nebulous condition of the sun, at its
greatest expansion, we cannot conceive of the operation of the
 cohesive force ; it was the product of the chemical force while
 overcoming the repulsive force of the nebula. This we see-
 beautifully illustrated in oxygen and hydrogen.         By the che
 mical force they are condensed into water ; and Dr. Henry, of
 the Smithsonian Institution at Washington, first proved that
 the cohesion between the molecules of water is probably equal
 to that between the molecules of ice.          In raising up a disk
 1 inch square from the surface of water, a force equal to the
 weight of only 53 grains is required ; but this is because
 Liver after layer of the water is broken successively, like a
 strong cord when its many strands are broken one by one
 (his experiments are described in the fourth volume of the
 American Philosophical Society, Philadelphia), — whence he
 comes to the conclusion that the tensile force necessary to
 break a cubic inch of water, instead of being 53 grains, must
 be several hundred pounds.          The difference between water
 and ice is not in the amount of cohesion, but in the fixed
 polarity of the molecules of ice, which by the action of heat
 are allowed in the water to turn in every direction.
     I have now pointed out in a very brief manner some of the
 many consequences flowing from the primitive diffusion of all
 matter through all space, and its slow condensation into stars

                which causes the  Stellar Radiations.           223
by the chemical force.       A few words more are necessary on
the source of solar heat.     My paper opposing the mechanical
theories of solar heat, the fall of meteorites in the sun, and the
fall of the materials of the sun towards its centre, was pub
lished in the ' Proceedings,' for 1867, of the Academy of
                                                        I
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia ; and at its close expressed
a hope that the subject was put at rest for ever.          But Mr.
Croll has lately brought      out  an  addition  to the mechanical
theory.     He admits the failure of the meteoric theory; and he
concedes that the falling together by gravity of the materials
of the sun would produce heat enough for only twenty millions
of years — an insufficient period. But he supposes that two
unluminous stars, each half the mass of our sun, must have
been propelled together in opposite directions with velocities
of 476 miles per second, and that their collision must have
produced heat enough to supply the solar radiations for 50
millions of years. This vast amount of heat would have ex
panded our sun very widely in a nebulous condition ; and by
 the falling together of this nebulous mass, heat enough wonld
 be produced to last 20 millions of years more of solar radia
 tions. These 50 millions of years of heat derived from the
 collision, and these 20 millions derived from the falling together
 of the solar materials, make together 70 millions of years of
 solar light and heat.     Many objections oppose all this.
     1. If the solar heat for 20 millions of years would be pro
 duced by the falling together of the materials of the sun, then
 precisely the same amount of energy, or heat, would be con
 sumed to expand the sun to its nebulous condition.        And this
 would be subtracted from the heat of collision, 50 millions of
 years. Instead therefore of 70 millions of years, his period
 would remain only the original 50 millions from collision.
     2. Mr. Croll has not proved, nor attempted to prove, that
  the heat of fifty millions of years would be sufficient to expand
  our sun far beyond the furthest planet, so that in condensing
  the solar system might be formed. When expanded only to
  the orbit of Neptune the sun was 14,000,000 less dense than
  hydrogen.     By the Table of Marsh this would absorb and
  render latent a wonderful amount of latent heat, which Mr.
  Croll must prove could be produced by his theoretical collision.
     3. If our Sun were expanded beyond the orbit of Neptune
  by a sudden production of heat from any cause, then, in order
  to contract to nearly his present size, that heat must first ra
  diate away. According to this scheme, the very fact of solar
   condensation presupposes the loss of heat by radiation.       But
  after the loss of all this heat which caused the expansion (the
  heat of 50 millions of years), none at all can be left for solar

224       On   the   Power which   causes       the   Stellar Rudiativm.
radiation after the formation of the planets. The theory leaves
the solar system from its first creation in total darkness and
inconceivably cold.
    4. Mayer, the author of the meteoric theory, could not
account for the former fused condition of our globe, and its
present interior heat, by the fall of meteorites.       He therefore
supposed that two opaque stars had collided to form our Earth
in a molten condition. Then he is bound to do the same with
the other planets.     In each case two planets must have collided,
leaving the resulting planet in a nebulous state to form its
satellites by condensation.      And, mirabile dictu, all the colli
sions must have been so nicely adjusted that the resulting
 planets should rotate in the same direction on their axes, and
revolve in the same plane and in the same direction round the
sun, the same direction that the sun rotates, and nearly in the
solar equatorial plane.     The chances against all this scheme of
 collisionsare infinite ; and therefore it is impossible. Mr. Croll's
theory is about the same. The sidereal systems are as orderly
as our solar system.        Our own sidereal system is composed
chiefly of the ring of the galaxy, like the ring of the asteroids,
and like the rings of Saturn.         The ring in Lyra, with other
sidereal rings, and other regular forms of sidereal systems,
shows the legitimate working of the nebular theory, but not
 the chance collisions of wandering stars.
    5. Mr. Croll has to assume velocities for his colliding stars
such as could not have been produced by the force of gravity.
This is his own admission. But              I
                                        have proved that gravity is
the force which in the beginning put all the heavens and the
earth in motion.      No other force can be conceived to cause
the stellar velocities ; and that force is sufficient*.
    6. Mr. Croll's theory        that originally all the stars were
                               is,
dark and cold, and in the most rapid motion — far beyond the
velocities which could be produced by the force of gravity.
The collisions, he says, have stopped them and made them
shine " The fixed stars arc suns, and they are visible because
      :
they have lost their motions."       But the fixed stars have not
lost their motions. Every astronomer knows that they have
their " proper motions," velocities more rapid than those of
the planets.   61 Cygni moves nearly 2000, and Arcturus nearly
3000    miles per minute.
    7. There are sound reasons for believing that collisions
among the stars         an impossibility.
                       is                      have proved that the

fixed stars in our sidereal system are all tmder each other's
influence through gravity.        Two stars approaching each other
 through gravity would at the same time be under the influence
of other neighbouring stars, drawing them from the right line
towards each other's centre.        Therefore they would not col
lide ; but they might approach very near to each other, so as
to remain permanently within their powerfully gravitating
force, and form a binary system. This is a mode of accounting
for the ten thousand double and multiple stars already known,
besides the mode of explanation by the nebular theory.          More
 over the nebular theory necessarily gives very high velocities
to all the stars, but to all in the same direction.    If afterwards,
by perturbation, they receive contrary directions, still the mo
tions of any two precisely toward one another would be the
most improbable of events.
    Therefore the mechanical theory of stellar light and heat
utterly fails in all its phases. The only true theory for the
" ignes aeterni " is that of chemical action. This also has been
abruptly denied, but only by those entirely unacquainted with
the foundations of that theory as explained by myself in ' The
                        '
Origin of the Stars and in subsequent papers.
XXIX.      On Acoustic Repulsion.       By V. DVORAK*.         With a
                     Note by Prof. A. M. MAYER.
1.    ACOUSTIC         Repulsion of Resonators which are open at
          one   end only. — In a previous article, " On Acoustic
Attraction and Repulsion,"        I   have conclusively proved by
theoretic considerations, as     well  as by experiments, that the
average pressure at the node in a column of air vibrating in
stationary waves cannot be equal to zero as long as the ampli
tude of vibration is not infinitely small.
    In a resonator open at one end, as, for example, a cylinder,
we find a node at the closed end.         In the interior of the cy
linder near its closed end there exists a greater pressure than
on the outer surface of this end which is touched by the out
side air, as can easily be shown by means of a sensitive mano
meter.
    To obtain resonance the opening of the cylinder is turned
toward the source of the sound ; and the cylinder is then re
pelled by the excess of pressure within. Resonators not having
a cylindrical form, but open at one end, are also subject to such
repulsion.     In my previous communication        I have indicated

means for observing the acoustic repulsion of resonators.             As
                                                         I
the method described there is not very sensitive, have replaced
it by the following.      The resonators here employed are usually
made of stiff drawing-paper covered with gum-arabic, and
have the shape of a cylinder, with a little paper tube, hf, at
one end (fig. 1, A).      This little tube may also be omitted (as
                 Fig. 1.                         Fig. 2.
in B) : in that case the resonator is 'tuned by increasing or
diminishing the little opening, fg. Even a cylindrical tube
open at one end, C, may serve our purpose as a resonator.
Spherical resonators of glass, D, which a practiced glass-
blower can make as light as paper resonators, are excellent.
The note of the resonators is determined by gently blowing
over the opening or by tapping.
   The resonator is fastened with sealing-wax to the end of a
light wooden rod, the other extremity of which is provided
with a counterpoise of lead, 0 (fig. 2). The centre of the rod
has a glass cap, H, which rests on a needle-point.
   The best source of sound is a resonant box of a tuning-fork
(fig. 2). The repulsion is so great that it is apparent even with
an ordinary brass Helmholtz resonator weighing, with the lead
counterpoise, 142 grams*.         With every tuning-fork we must
first ascertain whether the air in the resonating box vibrates
with sufficient energy, because this is not always the case even
with accurately tuned boxes. As the elasticity of the different
boards which form the elastic system of the box is not equal,
their vibrations may hinder the formation of the node at the
bottom of the box ; in this case the air on the bottom of the
box will vibrate but feebly. We can easily ascertain this fact
by accurately tuning the box to the note of the fork, and then
observing whether the note is considerably weakened by par
tially covering the opening.        If  it is not, then the air in the
   * The apparatus represented in fig. 3 may also be used to show acoustic
attraction by turning the closed end of the resonator toward the box.

box has but little vibration, even if the tone of the fork is pow
erful.     I have, for example, two boxes with excellent tuning-
forks by Konig (of 256 vibrations per second), in which the
air would in no wise vibrate powerfully.             The strength of the
vibration of the air was considerably affected by the degree of
tightness with which the fork was screwed to the top of the
box. The fork is always vibrated powerfully with a bow ; and
two bits of rubber tubmg must be on the bottom of the box.
I  generally use the fork A3, of 435 vibrations per second, by
Konig. Repulsion is then plainly visible with glass resonator
at a distance of 10 centimetres from the opening of the box.
With a large C fork of Konig (of 128 vibrations) which sounds
for more than ten minutes, it was apparent at a distance of
20 centimetres.
    The resonators may be tested either by the reinforcement of
the sound produced with a tuning-fork, or by the weakening
of the sound on approaching them to the opening of the box*.
It is not possible to obtain the repulsion of resonators from the
prongs of a tuning-fork alone, as their aerial vibrations are
too weak (compare Pogg. clvii. p. 42).              I  formerly tried in
vain to obtain acoustic repulsion         from   vibrating bodies with
out the aid of resonance.        I  suspended small resonators before
the end of a glass tube vibrating longitudinally, and provided
with a cork to increase the vibrating surface.              The open end
of  the   resonator  was  probably    too  near   the   end   of the fork,
and so produced a lowering of the tone and acoustic attraction
instead of repulsion.       Attraction is probably present in all
cases, and can assert itself only when not counteracted by
greater repulsionf.               I
                         Later obtained repulsion very easily in
a longitudinally vibrating glass tube 127 centims. long and
27 millims. in diameter, on the end of which was a cork 46
millims. in diameter. One of the resonators used was sphe
rical (fig. 1, D), and another cylindrical (C).
    I  also obtained powerful repulsion with a circular disk 31
centims. in diameter and 2 millims. thick, made by Konig.
The plate was fastened in the centre in a vertical position and
made to vibrate in six segments, producing a note of 208 vi
brations.      The resonator was made of stiff paper of the form
of B (fig. 1) ; ab equal 80 millims., cd 140 millims.,/^ equal
   » This is perhaps connected with a conversion of the aerial vibrations
in the box into the work of repulsion.    The vis i~iva of the sound-vibra
tions disappears to reappear as work.
   t  These experiments were also described in a previous communication.
In  the apparatus represented (fig. 2), repulsion is easily converted into
attraction by diminishing the opening of the resonator with wax, and so
throwing it out of tune.

two wooden rods, op, q r (fig. 3), crossing at right angles,
and balanced on a glass cap ; all the openings of the resona

nating box and fork, in the
manner indicated in fig. 3.
The open end a of resonator
 1 is repelled from K ; the
closed end b of resonator 2
is attracted : but in general
this attraction does not in
crease the rapidity of rota
tion, because it counteracts
rotation the moment the re
sonator (2) has changed its
position about 45°.           It is
therefore not possible to ob
tain continuous rotation by
 means of acoustic attraction,
as   I  have shown by numerous experiments*.                 The resonator
       continues to move by reason of its inertia, and resonator
  1^
  2) takes its place, being in turn repelled, and so on.
     A very rapid rotation is obtained by using a large Knndf s
tube and placing a small acoustic mill before its open end.
     The glass tube (Kundt's), which vibrates longitudinally and
produces the tone, is fastened to a heavy table, and protrudes
only a short distance through the cork into the glass tube,
placed upon a separate table so that its open end projects
somewhat beyond the edge of the latter.                  The length of the
rod was 127 centims., the diameter 27 millims. ; the half wave
length of its note, jj, equals 10£ centirns.            The length of the
tube was 45 centims.       ;   the length    of the vibrating column of
air, corrected     for the open end, was 3 „ +           j ; the inner dia
meter was      5 centims.
   *
      Instead of the resonators (fig. 3) I used vertical paper vanes, varying
   e curvature, without achieving any results,  notwithstanding the fact that
there was a pretty strong acoustic attraction   for each separate vane.

   3.   The Acoustic Torsion-balance. —  If we hang by a wire a
wooden rod provided with a resonator, like the beam of a
Coulomb's torsion-balance, in a case having an opening in the
side turned toward the resonator, we can compare the inten
sity of notes having an equal number of vibrations by means
of the repulsion of the resonator ; but further experiments are
necessary to test the practicability of this method.    The sound
proceeded from an open pipe, having the note A (of 435 vi
brations).    To prevent the current of air which passes through
the pipe from striking the resonator attached to the balance,
we must cut the pipe exactly in the middle of its node, and
insert a slack membrane softened with glycerine.       To prevent
the air issuing from the mouth of the pipe from impinging on
the resonator, a broad box is used which surrounds the mouth
of the pipe air-tight. This box is open on the side opposite
the resonator, so as not to impair the tone.          The pipe is
sounded by means of a Konig's acoustic bellows with a uni
form blast of air. The distance of the resonator from the
mouth of the pipe must be at least 2 or 3 centims., to avoid a
change of pitch.
   4. Production of Aerial Currents by Sound. — It may easily
be proved by simple theoretic considerations that the mean
pressure at the node of a column of air is greater than at its
ventre ; and that it steadily diminishes in passing from the
node to the ventre, provided that the amplitude of vibration
is not infinitely small.
   It would seem that this difference of pressure would be
neutralized by the passage of the air from the node to the
ventre. There would then be produced a mean pressure in
the whole column, which would be greater, however, than that
of air at rest ; consequently air would issue from the opening
of the vessel in which it forms stationary waves.       I have not
succeeded, so far, in making the whole process clear ; for in
 reality no perfect balance of pressure takes place.    The mano
meter always shows a slight excess of pressure even at the
ventre ; but this excess increases as we pass to the node.      All
my previous experiments indicate moreover that a current of
air passes from the node to the ventre, at least in Kundt's
tube, in which the air-waves are very powerful.         This prin
cipal current lasts as long as    the  air vibrates. Besides, the
same experiments show a continuous secondary current, close
to the walls of the tube and in a direction contrary to that of
the principal current ; so that the whole air in the tube is in
circulation.   The cross section of the principal current is nearly
as great as that of the tube, while that of the secondary cur
rent is a very narrow ring.

  230             M. Dvorak on Acoustic Repulsion.
     The excess of pressure as shown by a manometer at the node
  is always less than the theoretical pressure, because in the
  latter the air is not supposed to move from the node and to
  equalize the pressure. Of course the excess of pressure at
  the ventre is not equal to zero, as theory requires. Probably
  the friction of the walls has much to do with these phenomena.
  It may be expected from what has been said, that the air will
  issue from the vessel in which it vibrates in stationary waves.
  The manometer shows, in the first place, that the excess of pres
  sure is not equal to zero in the plane of the opening of a reso
  nator, because a portion of the air immediately in front of this
  opening partakes of this stationary wave-motion, and because
  there is always a small excess of pressure even in the ventre
 of a stationary wave.     There is no doubt that a partial equali
  zation of pressure takes place at the opening; experiments
 show, furthermore, that there is a continuous exit of air, which,
 as in Kundt's tube, is probably neutralized by a secondary
 and contrary current.
     The exit of the air can easily be proved as follows : a sphe
 rical glass resonator is placed before the resonant base of a
 tuning-fork ; the resonator is filled with tobacco-smoke; strong
 vibrations are given to the fork, when the smoke will be seen
 to rush from the resonator.
     The current of air proceeding from a resonator is well shown
 fey means of a Chladni plate, by means of lycopodium, which
 accumulates upon the ventres in little heaps when the plate is
 sounded.     If now we place the opening of a bottle (or bottles)
 of a resonator, D, over such a heap, the lycopodium is imme
 diately blown about in a circle, and may be scattered in any
 direction by giving suitable inclinations to the resonator. A
 glass plate held over a heap of lycopodium produces the oppo
 site effect by causing it to contract.
     I have succeeded in producing comparatively strong cur
 rents of air in still another manner ; but   I have not yet found
 an explanation of these complicated phenomena.
     A cone made of stiff paper was held with its large end oppo
 site the opening of a large Kundt's tube.        The size of this
cone may vary ; but its effect is greatest when it vibrates to
the same note as the Kundt's tube, and so forms a resonator
open at both ends ; the diameters of its open ends are 37 and
7 millims., and its length 90 millims.
     When the Kundt's tube begins to sound loudly, a current
of air issues from the narrow end of the cone with such vio
lence that it easily blows out the flame of a candle at a distance
of 20 centims. This current rushes through the cone with a
peculiar noise, and is easily felt with the finger.

    The cone may be replaced                    Fig. 4.

width oi the Kundt's tube,
open at the end turned to
ward the latter, and closed
all but a small hole at the
end ; but the current is much
 weaker; nevertheless it will
move a small wheel with ver- . .
tical paper vanes (fig. 4).
    In the experiments with the tuning-forks, it is essential
that the cone should vibrate to the same note as the fork ;
otherwise the current is too weak. For the fork A (of 435
vibrations) the openings of the cone have diameters of 82 and
3 millims., and its length is 373 millims.         The opening at the
apex of the cone must be very small to obtain an appreciable
current.
    On conclusion of this investigation, Dr. R. Konig kindly
communicated to me that Mr. Alfred Mayer in New York
 [Hoboken] had previously succeeded in producing continuous
rotation by means of sound.         The communication was as fol
lows : —  " .Professor A. M. Mayer showed me a very similar ex
periment last summer (1876).          He suspended by a thread two
large well-tuned flasks attached to a rod, and caused the whole
apparatus to revolve by means of a tuning-fork.             I  informed
him in consequence that you had previously demonstrated the
phenomena of repulsion in resonators; for he was not acquainted
with your paper* on acoustic attraction and repulsion."
   Note by Professor ALFRED M. MAYER. — My connexion with
the discovery of the sound-mill is as follows : —
    In January 1876       I made the discovery (first reached by
theoretic deductions) that there was more pressure on the inner
surface of the bottom of a resounding cavity than on the outer
surface of the bottom, which touches the outer air.             I  subse
quently proved the truth of this conclusion by experiments on
suspended resonators, and by observations on the motions of
precipitated silica powder and films of soap-bubbles placed at
various points in resonators of different forms. My first pub
lication of these results was on May 22, 1876, on which day              I
read a paper on this discovery before the New- York Academy
of Sciences, and exhibited before the members an apparatus
formed of two + arms of light wood, with a resonator attached
to each arm, as in fig. 3 of Professor Dvorak's paper.                On
sounding an organ-pipe, or a fork on its resonant box, in tune
with these resonators, they were successively repelled from the
     *
       Reftd before the Royal Academy  of Sciences, Vienna, in  1875.

232             M. Dvordk on Acoustic Repulsion.
pipe, or fork, and a continuous rotation was exhibited.           At
 the same meeting this experiment was preceded by those on
 the motions of silica-powder &c. in resonators.
    On the 8th of July, 1876, there appeared in the ' Scientific
             '
American a report of this meeting of the Academy, in which
 my experiments on Acoustic Repulsion are thus referred to : —
    " In the next place, Professor Mayer exhibited an apparatus
constructed by him to produce motion by means of sound-
pulses.     Four glass resonators on cross-arms were suspended
 by means of a string.      On sounding an organ-pipe in tune
 with the resonators and bringing it opposite the mouth of one
of them, the resonator was repelled and the apparatus com
menced to rotate.       This experiment was the more striking
from the fact that, so far from any current of air proceeding
out of the mouth of the organ-pipe, the air is actually sucked
in, as may be rendered visible by means of smoke from a cigar.
The smoke is carried up the pipe even when the latter is closed
at the top with cotton wool so as to smother the sound.          On
substituting   disks of cardboard    for  the resonators,  they were
drawn up to the mouth of the organ-pipe with considerable
force.   When fine silica-powder was placed in the resonators,
it was thrown into violent motion on sounding the pipe."
    In the same month (July 1876) Dr. Rudolph Kb'nig visited
me, and    I exhibited the same experiments before him.
    The discovery of the acoustic repulsion of resonators and
the invention of the sound-mill were made independently by
Professor Dvordk and myself.          It is another instance of men,
even so far distant as Agram and Hoboken, led into the same
path of research by the natural growth of science.
    Dimensions of the resonators and reaction-wheels used, in
millimetres : —
    (1) Fork C, of 128 vibrations.        Glass resonator of form E
(fig. 1), a b equalled 90 ; h i, 25 ; h k, 20 ; kf, 33 ; fg, 8. Its
weight, together with its leaden counterpoise, was 70 grams.
    (2) Fork A, 435 vibrations per second.            (a) The glass
resonator used in the experiment represented in fig. 2, and to
show the current of air by means of smoke, was of the form D

resonators of the acoustic mill were of the form D : a b equalled
34 ; hf, 12 ; fg, 3.     The length of the arms from the middle
of the glass cap to the middle of the resonator was 52 millims.
The weight of the whole wheel was 23 grams. (e) Paper re

a b equalled 34 ; ed, 50 ; hf, 6 ; fg, 9.        The length of the
arms was 65 millims., the weight of the whole wheel 9 grams.

   It is a striking fact that very small resonators may give a
very deep note : with fork A,         I used a glass resonator of the
form D (fig. 1), in which a b equalled 24, A/ 14, and fg 1
millim.     The volume was about ninety times loss than that of
the resonant box of the fork, to whose note the resonator was
tuned. Notwithstanding its smallness it showed acoustic re
pulsion.

THE1.     " On the Quartzites of Shropshire."       By Charles CaUaway,
Esq., M.A., B.Sc., F.G.S.
   In a former paper (Q. J. G. S. xxxiii. p. 652) the author indicated
that part of the so-called quartzites of the Wrekin are " Hollybush
Sandstone ;" in the present communication he shows that the
whole, both in the Wrekin and Church -Stretton areas, are of Cam
brian or Precambrian and not of Caradoc ago.
   In the Wrekin area the quartzites rest unconformably against the
volcanic axis in a nearly continuous band, dipping away from it at
angles of from 30° to 55°, their present position being due to its
elevation.    The volcanic rock is a bedded Precambrian tuff, which
reappears    in Lawrence Hill and the Ercal, also accompanied by
quartzites overlain by Hollybush Sandstone. Caer Caradoc belongs
to the same volcanic series ; and the quartzites reappear on its S.E.
flank, overlain by Hollybush Sandstone containing Kutorgina cin-
gulata and Serpulites fistula, above which follow the Shineton Shales,
and next, separated by a fault, the Hoar-Edge grits (Lower Caradoo).
The author believes that tho apparently conformable succession here
is due to parallel faults.       Along the S.E. flank of the Wrekin the
quartz rock dips S.E., while the volcanic rocks dip N., and fragments
of the latter are contained in its base.         The author is inclined to
consider this a friction-breccia, and the junction a faulted one.      He
also regards the junction with the Hollybush Sandstones as a faulted
one, and maintains that in an}r case the quartzites are older than the
latter rocks, which are sometimes considered the equivalents of the
Ffostiniog group, and by Mr. Belt to be Menevian.         The quartzites
can hardly belong      to  any part of the Upper Cambrian ; and the
author passes    on  to consider the various positions which they may
be held to occupy,    and  gives reasons for thinking that they are Pre

 Cambrian. The only fossil that has been found in them is a sup
posed worm-burrow.         In conclusion the author expresses the opinion
that the Stiper-stones quartzites are of Arenig age.

    The following communication was read : —
    1. " On the Section of Messrs. Meux & Co.'s Artesian Well in the
Tottenham Court Road, with notices of the Well at Crossness, and
another at Shoreham, Kent; and on the probable Range of the
Lower Greensand and Palaeozoic Rocks under London."              By Prof.
 Prestwich, M.A., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
    The well-known boring at Kentish Town in 1856 showed the
absence at that point of Lower Greensand, the Gault being im
mediately succeeded by hard red and variegated sandstones and
cluys, the age of which was at first doubtful, but which were finally
considered by the author to approach most nearly to the Old Red
Sandstone near Frome, and to the Devonian sandstones and marls
near Mons, in Belgium.          The existence of some doubt as to this
identification rendered the boring lately made at Messrs. Meux's
brewery particularly interesting ; and the method of working adopted
 by the Diamond Boring Company, by bringing up sharply cut cores
from known depths, gave special certainty to the results obtained.
 The boring passed through 652£ feet of Chalk, 28 feet of Upper
 Greensand, and 160 feet of Gault, at the base of which was a seam,
3 or 4 feet thick, of phosphatic nodules and quartzite pebbles.
 Beneath this was a sandy calcareous stratum of a light ash-colour,
 passing into a pale or white limestone, and this into a rock of oolitic
 aspect.    Casts and impressions of shells found in this bed showed it
 to be the Lower Greensand, whose place it occupied.       The boring was
 carried further in the hope of reaching the loose water-bearing
 sands of this formation ; but the rock became very argillaceous ; and

               Prof.   J.    Prestwich on Artesian Wells.               235
 when 62 feet of it had been passed through, the boring entered into
 mottled red, purple, and greenish shales, dipping at 35° in an
 unascertained direction.     These beds continued through a depth of
 80 feet, when, their nature being clearly ascertained, the boring was
 stopped.     The fossils of these coloured beds, which included Spiri-
feara   disjwncta,  Rhynchonella cuboides, and species of Edmondia,
 Chonetts, and Orthis, show them to be of Devonian age.            Thus the
 existence of Palaeozoic rocks at an accessible depth under London,
 and the absence of the Jurassic series, as maintained long since by
 Mr. Godwin- Austen, arc experimentally demonstrated.
     These facts are of interest in connexion with the question of the
 possible extension of the Coal-measures under the Cretaceous and
 Tertiary strata of the south-east of England.          The beds found at
 the bottom of Messrs. Meux's boring are of the same character as
 the Devonian strata which everywhere accompany the Coal-mea
 sures in Belgium and the north      oi'France, being brought into juxta
 position with them by great faults and flexures.        The author refers
 especially toa    remarkable section at Auchy-au-Bois, in the western
 extremity of the Valenciennes coal-field, which      is particularly inter
 esting from its furnishing evidence that the Hardinghen coal-field,
 between Calais and Boulogne,        is   aprolongation of that of Valen
  ciennes, and because the same strike and    a  prolongation of the same
 great fault observed at Auchy-au-Bois through Hardinghen would
  carry the southern boundary of any coal-field in the south-east of
 England just south of Maidstone, thence passing a little north of
  London.     Henceit   isin the district north of London that there      is
  most probability of the discovery of the Carboniferous strata. The
  extent of country in which shafts could be sunk to the Palaeozoic
  strata, however, will be limited by the presence of the water-bearing
  Lower Greensand, which probably reaches close to London in the
  south, reappears in Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire 30 or 40
  miles north of London, and probably extends some distance towards
  the city under the Chalk hills of those counties and Hertfordshire.
     The nature of the representative of the Lower Greensand in the
  boring, and the characters of the fossils contained in          it,lead the
  author to the conclusion that in   it  we have  a  deposit produced near
  the shore of the Neocomian sea, here probably consisting of cliffs of
  Devonian (or Carboniferous) rock.       From these cliffs the calcareous
  material which here replaces the usual loose sands of the Lower
  Greensand was perhaps derived by the agency of springs          ;  and the
  shore-line itself must he situated between the south end of Totten
  ham Court Road and the Kentish Town boring.            The sandy beds of
  the Lower Greensand will probably be found to set in at no great
  distance to the southward, presenting the conditions necessary for
  storing and transmitting underground waters.        A   test boring made
  by Mr. H. Bingham Mildmay at Shoreham Place,          about 5  miles from
  Sevenoaks, and in which the Lower Greensand            was   met    with at
  about the estimated depth (450 feet) and furnished           a   supply of
 water, seems to confirm these views.

    ON SOME   PROBLEMS OF THE MECHANICAL THBORY OF HEAT.
                BY PROFESSOR LUDWIG BOLTZMANN.
     HE first  section of the memoir has for its subject the relation
      between the Second   Proposition and the calculation of probabili
ties; the second, the thermal equilibrium of a heavy gas.         To these
the author adds the following communication: — In the Beibldtter to
Wiedemann's Annalen der Physik, Band II. Stuck 5, is a treatise
by S. Tolver Preston, in which the diffusion of gases is brought
into relation with the Second Proposition of the mechanical theory
of heat. This cannot (as, according to the notice in the Beiblatter,
the author seems to think) serve for the refutation of that proposi
tion ; but it may well be a new and interesting application of it.
There is in the same Stiick of the Beibldtter a notice of a memoir
by M. Clausius on this subject.       Now, knowing nothing more of
the contents of the memoir than what may be gathered from this
notice, and not in the least wishing to forestall             will merely
                                                                     it,
                                                                     I
mention that, as  it  appears to me, the most essential problem that
here comes into question, namely the calculation of how much heat
can be transformed into work without any other compensation than
the mixture of two dissimilar gases — or, to use the terminology of
M. Clausius, the calculation of the transformation-value of the
mixture of two dissimilar gases — only          special case of some cal
                                                is          a
culations which I    have carried out in my treatise " On the Relation
between the Second Proposition of the Mechanical Theory of Heat
and the Calculation of Probabilities as regards the Propositions re
specting Thermal Equilibrium."           have, namely, there considered
                                               I
quite generally the case that in any mixture of substances, whether
it  be the mixture or the distribution of velocities or of directions of
velocities, the entropy does not perfectly correspond to the definitive
final state, and have shown that then           must always be less than
                                                            it
in the definitive final state, so that consequently, on the transition
into the latter, heat may be converted into work and have given  ;     I
a  formula (formula 51) by which the difference of entropy, and con
sequently also the amount of the convertible heat, can be calculated.
    From this formula (51)       immediately follows that the entropy
                                     it
of a mixture of several gases      exactly equal to the sum of the en

and at the same temperature T ; secondly, the same gases are mixed ,
at the same temperature, in the space V, 4- V2, while the total pres
sure is equal to the previous pressure of each separate gas.   In the
first case let E, be the entropy of the first, E, that of the second
gas ; in the second case let E, 2 be that of the mixture.  According
to the rule given above, E,, E2, and E,2 can be calculated by means
of the above formula. We thus find
   But this is the expression for the quantity of heat which can be
converted into work without any other compensation than the mix
ture of the two gases.   Therein is y'—y the product of the weight
of unit volume into the difference of the two specific heats, which
product has the same value for both gases.
   The total work which can be gained from this heat         is,
                                                          according
to known principles,
   To gain this total work, of course we should not have recourse to
the expedient of diffusion through porous partitions, but convey the
one gas into the other by means of substance that chemically com
                                      a
bines with one of the gases under partial dissociation (as quick-lime
with carbonic acid), of course taking care that the process always
remains reversible.     We should, for example, first indefinitely
expand the first gas, then with the substance above mentioned
transfer it  very slowly into the other, while, again,        would be

continually compressed so that the partial pressure of the first gas
                              _
was always equal in both vessels.       Lastly, the mixture of gases
must be so far expanded that its volume shall be equal to the sum
of the volumes of the original gases.    Since all these processes can
easily be accompanied by calculation,      will be easy in this way to
                                           it

ON THE   RELATION OF THE WORK PERFORMED BY DIFFUSION                   TO
   THE SECOND PROPOSITION OF THE                MECHANICAL   THEORY OF
   HEAT.  BY PROF. R. CLAUSIUS.
   In 'Nature' for January 1878 (vol. xvii. p. 202), Mr. Tolver
Preston has specified  a  process by means of which mechanical work
can be gained through diffusion of gases.       The reflections he makes
upon   this fact are very ingenious,   and  in   relation to theory very
interesting   on account of  the conclusions   to  which they give occa
sion; only in one point I     think
                                  I     must express   a   view different
from his he thinks, namely, that the result of his process contra
         :
dicts the second proposition of the mechanical theory of heat      ;  and
in this
     I     cannot coincide.
   The substance of his process        as follows.      He imagines cy
                                   by is
                                                                   a
linder divided into two sections          movable piston.
                                           a                   The piston
consists of porous substance, such as pipe-clay or graphite.
             a                                                         In
the two divisions of the cylinder two different gases are present,
oxygen and hydrogen for instance.

238           Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
   If, now, both gases have initially equal pressure, a change is soon
produced therein by diffusion.      The hydrogen penetrates through
the porous piston more quickly than the oxygen ; hence the amount
of gas present on the hydrogen side diminishes, while that on the
oxygen side increases. This produces a lessening of pressure on
the hydrogen side, and an augmentation of pressure on the oxygen
side, so that the piston can be put in motion with a certain force,
and mechanical work performed capable of being made useful ex
ternally.   At the same time, with the movement of the piston the
gas on the side where it expands becomes cooler, and becomes
warmer on the side where it is compressed ; and consequently heat
passes over from a colder to a hotter body.
   These two circumstances, that work is gained in the process
without there being any difference of temperature present initially,
and that simultaneously heat also passes over from the colder divi
sion into the hotter, are regarded by Mr. Preston as contradicting
the second proposition of the mechanical theory of heat.
   To this inference   I cannot assent. If the conversion of heat into
work and the transference of heat from the colder to the hotter
body had taken place in such manner that the variable material at
the end of the operation were found in its oriijinal state, so that we
had to do with a cyclical process, then certainly there would be in it
a contradiction to the second proposition of the mechanical theory
of heat. But the matter does not stand thus. We have, in the
process, as variable material the two gases.      These are at the com
mencement unmixed, and at the conclusion mixed ; and therefore an
essential change has taken place with them, which may be regarded as
a compensation for the conversion of heat into work and the trans
ference of heat from a colder into a hotter body. Since the gases,
through the molecular motion which we call heat, tend to mingle,
and indeed in such wise that the higher the temperature the more
quickly does the mixture result, we have here to do with an action
of heat comparable to the expansion of a gas by heat ; and hence
we must ascribe to the mixed gases a greater disgregatiou than to
the unmixed.      Now, since the increase of disgregation is a positive
change, it may be compensated by the transformation of heat into
work and the transference of heat from a colder into a hotter body,
both of which are negative changes.
   It is therefore evident that, although it is true that the present
case possesses certain peculiarities by which it is superficially di
stinguished from other cases, yet in the essential points with which
we are concerned in the mechanical theory of heat it is in complete
harmony with the cases usually treated, and contains nothing con
tradictory to the second proposition of the mechanical theory of
heat. —Wiedemann's Annalen, 1878, pp. 341-343.
  ON MOSANDRUM, A NEW ELEMENT.            BY   J.  LAWRENCE    SMITH.
   Having read the interesting communication from M. J.-L. Soret
to the Academy relative to the absorption-spectrum of the gadolinite

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                      23t)
earths in the ultra-violet rays*,           I  hasten, with a view to my own
interest, to bring to the knowledge of the Academy that the earth
designated X was discovered by me more than a year ago : the dis
covery was publicly announced, in the course of the proceedings of
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, in May 1877t ; a
communication to the same effect was also sent to the said Academy
in November of the same year.
    My conclusions were based entirely on chemical principles ; for
it was proved that the earth which                 I had discovered was distin
guished by       its  properties      from  all  those   known to belong to the
yttria    and  cerium     groups,   although    it  came  very near those earths,
the chemical properties of which shade almost insensibly into one
another.       A short time after announcing the discovery, sent a          I
 specimen     to  M. Delafontaine, of Chicago, who thought that it would
 prove    to be  either   Mosander's terbia or some new earth.               It was,
 however, impossible for me to make its properties agree with those
 at that time attributed to terbia.
    I   was desirous as far as possible to rid this new earth of the pre
 sence of earths already known, in order to study its properties and
 constituent parts.          For better success       I  required a little of the
 terbia which M. Marignac had recently extracted from gadolinite.
 I  wrote therefore, in March, to that able chemist.                  He possessed
 too small a quantity of that earth to let me have any ; but he ex
 amined my new earth and the nitrate, which                 I sent to him ; and in
 communicating         to  me   the  result  of   his  examination    he says (inter
 alia),   " Not   only   am   I  convinced    of the   identity  of your earth and
 my    terbia,  but  I  may   add   that  you  have   obtained  it in greater purity
 than I." After M. Soret had examined my earth by means of the
 spectroscope, he said to me,             I
                                        " can have no doubt about the iden
 tity of that chembt'sj [M. Delafontaine's] and my terbia and your
 earth."
     The spectroscopic observation of M. Soret placed beyond doubt
 that the earths of samarskite contain a new metal, as                 I  announced
 in May      1877,   my   first  specimen    then    obtained   giving   the absorp
 tion-spectrum marked No. 2 in his communication.                       I  no longer
 hesitate to give to this metal the name of mosandmm, in honour of
 the distinguished chemist whose researches and remarkable disco
 veries in this class of earths form a brilliant epoch in the history of
  metallic chemistry.
     In giving the following succinct history of this discovery,                    I
    » This has no relation to the Ural samarskite, hi which I, concurrently
 with other chemists, have found oxide of cerium.
    t"  Comptei Rendus, April 20, 1878.
       Professor Lawrence Smith made some observations on the anomalous
 properties of the earthy oxides of samarekite, and stated the reasons which
 led him to believe that those oxides do not contain cerium, and that most
  of what is regarded as cerium is a new element.'' — Annals of the Phila
  delphia Academy of Natural Sciences, May 8, 1877.
     \ In the course of more recent researches M. Delafontaine believed he
  had discovered another new earth ; hut M. Soret's experiments and M.
 Marigrpac's conclusions make it evident that this earth is identical with
 that discovered by me.

240             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
acknowledge my obligations to M. Delafontaine for the numerous
suggestions with which he has kindly aided my investigations.
    Towards the end of 1876         I  was engaged in the mineralogical and
chemical study of the American minerals containing niobic acid, and,
among others, of sarnarskite, a considerable quantity of which had
been found in North Carolina.                          I
                                          In so doing discovered two new
minerals, a report on which was addressed to this Academy.                  In
separating the earths from the saraarskite           I  gained the conviction
that they contained no acid oxide of cerium, or at the most only
slight traces — a fact which is recorded in the publication of my
results*.     Other chemists who examined this samarskite (as Mr.
 Hunt, Mr. Allen, and Miss Swallow) concurred with each other in
 finding in it some oxide of cerium ; M. Delafontaine, in a private
                                                       I
letter dated 4th May 1877, writes to me, " have ascertained no
thing that can make me doubt the presence of cerium;" and in a
letter of the 21st of the same month he passes in review the causes
which might have misled me in my conclusions, ending with these
words : — " But     I  suppose you have an equally good method : and
we may expect to receive from you a monograph upon a new ele
ment — which,      I  avow, would give me great pleasure ; for it has
already seemed to me that the hypothesis of the existence of such
an element would give a satisfactory explanation of certain incon
gruities in the properties of the other earths." In a still more recent
                                                               I
letter he says, in regard to the samarskite earths, " am convinced
now of the absence, almost if not absolutely total, of the oxide of
cerium ; and no one has any longer a doubt on this point."
                                      I
    M. Delafontaine, to whom remitted a little of the earth, which
I   had purified as much as it was then possible for me to do so, and
also a large quantity of the mineral, concluded that it was either
terbia or a new earth.         Not finding, however, the chemical proper
ties correspond to those then kuown of terbia,           I addressed a report
to the Paris Academy of Sciences, insisting on my first conclusions,
asserting that the new earth is distinguished from that of the yttria
group by the action of sulphate of potasst, from the oxide of cerium
by its solubility in extremely dilute nitric acid and in a solution of
alkalies supersaturated with chlorine, from lanthanum by the colour
of its oxide and of its salts, from didymium by the absorption-lines
of the latter in the bright part of the spectrum.            I abstained from
gi\ ing any definite name to the metal constituting the base of this
earth, because     I knew it was necessary to proceed with great cir
cumspection, working, as          I   did, among a group of oxides which
figure among the elements as the asteroids among the planets. But
the spectroscope, in the skilful hand of M. Soret, has supplied what
was wanting ; and        I seize this opportunity of announcing that the
existence of the element, which           I suspected in 1876, is no longer
hypothetical, but real. — Comptes Rendns de TAcadcmie des Sci&ices,

                                [Plate  IV.]
     T?ORT5T years ago Professor Moseley pointed out (Phil.
     J-
1.
             Trans. 1838) that the curves affected by discoid and
turbinated shells were derivable from the logarithmic spiral ;
and after him Naumann gave the name of concho-spiral to an
allied curve, in which the differences of the radii in the same
direction form a geometrical progression, but the initial radius
is not one of the series.       By such, a modification he hoped to
bring the measurements of actual shells more into harmony
with calculation.         The errors of observation, however, are
always greater than this change would correct— if founded on
fact, which is doubtful ; and all practical advantage is lost by
the complication of the equations.
    In working through the fossil Cephalopoda,              I have been
obliged    to  obtain   some clearness    of  idea  as  to their mode of
origin and consequent connexion with each other, and to find
some means of recognizing in fragments the nature of the
whole ; and     I have thus been led to the following results.
    2. If  we examine the shell of a Nautilus in which the earlier
are preserved by the later whorls, we find that the shell bends
back upon itself as in fig. 1. Let A R B be the section of the
earliest stage, which in the Nautilus is nearly a semicircle.
On the growth of the shell, A B (the line in which the embryonic-

242        Rev.  J.  F. Blake  on the Measurement   of the
shell section cuts the plane of growth) becomes D E, and D E
subsequently G F. We have now only to suppose two laws of
growth to make both inner and outer edges equiangular spi
rals. These are, that the shell-forming animal grows always
obliquely to its present edge, and that the outside grows at a
faster rate than the inside m a constant ratio. It is easy then
to see, by similar triangles, that all the edges will meet in a
common point C, which, when the growth becomes continuous,
is the pole of the curve which the polygon becomes.         If « be
the angle between the radius and the tangent (in other words,
represent the direction of growth), we may write the equation
to the outer curve,
The initial radius is taken as unity for simplicity, the applica
tions being always relative. The inner curve in the same way
may be written
                              r=\e* >cota,
or
taking X, the ratio of growth, to be e~ftcoi«. This shows that
we may consider the inner as an earlier portion of the outer
curve, and look on its growth as retarded. The two elements,
therefore, which completely determine the form of the section
are « the spiral angle, and /8 the angle of retardation.    It thus
appears   that the  form  of the central   section of a Nautilus  is
independent of the shape and size of the embryo, depending
only on the direction and relative rate of growth.
    If, now, we consider turbinated shells, a new element is in
troduced. The direction of growth is no longer in one plane.
but makes a constant acute angle with a fixed plane ; and
this, in combination with the variable angle which the direc
 tion of growth makes with a fixed line in that plane, produces
a curve of double curvature, which, as it partakes of the nature
 both of a helix and a spiral, may be called a helico-spiral.
 This third constant angle, which will be the complement of
 the semi- vertical angle of the enveloping cone for a fixed point
 in the surface of growth, may be called the angle of elevation,
and be denoted by y.
    These three angular elements, together with the equation to
 the trace on any plane through the pole making a finite angle
 with the direction of growth thus determined, of the outline
 of one whorl of the shell, are sufficient completely to deter
 mine the form of the whole shell so long as the growth is uni
 form ; and these, therefore, or their equivalents ought to form

         Curves formed by Cephalopoda                                  and other Mollusks.                       243

244        Rev.  J.   F. Blake  on the Measurement   of the
and equal in the two valves among the Lamellibranchiata, but
greater in the ventral valve among the Brachiopoda.              The
various forms among the latter class are produced partly by
changes of form of the tracing curve, partly by differences in
the value of a.      Thus such transversely oval forms as Obolus
have approximately «> 1, and the inner edge coinciding with
the axis, or tr=l; while elongate ovals, as Siphonotreta, have
K < 1.    Where the hinge-line is straight, as in Spirifera and
other genera, the ellipse, in which usually K> 1, overlaps the
axis, and consequently X < a, which involves a > 1 ; to ob
tain which the angle of retardation must be imaginary, as it
must be therefore in all shells in which we assume a curve
cutting the axis. Then also the ratio of growth of the inner
edge, which does not, so to speak, exist, is imaginary ; but ir,
with which we have practically to deal, is real. We can in
these cases nevertheless speak of the angle of retardation as
being that of the centre over the outer edge, unless the centre
itself is on the negative side of the axis, when the phrase be
comes useless ana a is negative and >1.             In such conical
forms as Discina a. is nearly zero, and y has a moderately
small positive or negative value, the latter corresponding to
the flat valve. When, as is usually the case, the two valves
turn in opposite directions, we must reckon a. negative in the
dorsal valve ; but when that valve is concave, as in the Pro-
ductidce, a. is still positive, but has a different value, less than
that of the ventral.
   In the Lamellibranchiata these same differences are com
bined with a very small but not zero value of 7. They all, with
few exceptions, principally among the Ostreidce, have the
values of a. of opposite sign in the two valves, and they pre
sent a greater variety of tracing curves.         Their values of *,
however, are larger than we find among the Brachiopoda,
whose maximum values belong to the Pentameri.             Of this we
have notable examples, combined with a considerable value of
7, in such shells as Isocardia and Diceras, and with a very low
value of 7 in Caprinella.
    Among the Gasteropoda (for a considerable number of
which the value of a. has been observed by Professor Nau-
mann), we have «=0 for the limpets, while /8 is very small
for the Dentaliadce and very large for Haliotis. The suitable
values for the other mollusks (the Pteropoda and Cepha
lopoda) will immediately suggest themselves — as we may say
generally that the curvature depends on «, the involution on p,
and the elevation on y.
   The direction of the major axis of the generating ellipse in
Gasteropoda is generally oblique — being approximately parallel

If   the whorls touch on the same side of the axis, the larger of
these values must equal what the smaller becomes when 0+ 2?r

since the similarly placed ellipses must touch if they meet on
the line joining their centres.        The whorls therefore intersect

     If corresponding     whorls on the opposite sides of the axis
 touch, the greater value of z when r=0 in equation (A) must
 equal the smaller value of z when 0 + ir is written for 0, and r
 again put equal to 0, since it is easily shown that if the two
 ellipses meet on the axis they must touch.             The condition for
 this may be deduced in a similar manner to the last ; and we
 find accordingly that shells are umbilicated or not according
 as
              or < cosec2e*>/a2(K2cot36        + l)-l(e'rcot«+l).       (2)

246         Bev. J.  F. Blake     on the Measurement   of the
Very few shells make the expressions above compared equal
to each other. Cyclostoma and Scalaria are examples in which
this nearly happens in both cases. Some Turrilitce also ap
proximate to making (1) an equality, and (2) somewhat less
closely.
    As an example of the application of these equations, the
shell of Cyclostoma elegans may be taken. Jn this the value
of y, ascertained by measurement, is 78£°, e= 156°, K= '87315,
and a may be calculated, either directly from the equation
defining it or by methods to be presently noted, to be '46. Also
        by observation =       ^-.   Substituting these values  in
                               V

                    sin (e + 7) s/ K* + Got\e + 7)
we obtain '216 approximately, while
The whorls therefore, according to this calculation, are slightly
out of contact ; and it will be seen in the shell that the outline
deviates slightly from the elliptic form in order to bring them
into contact. Similar substitutions in the expression of (2)
make the left-hand side 2-679, while the left is '841. The
whorls therefore cut the axis, but leave a spiral umbilicus.
    6. In the case of discoid shells we need only discuss the
condition of contact on the same side of the axis. Here 7=0
and 6=90°, and (1) becomes
showing that contact or overlapping is independent of the shape
of the whorls. Indeed it is obvious that they will be in con
tact or not according as the retardation of the inner edge is
greater or less than 360°.         As the retardation increases from
this value   the whorls    more or less overlap, becoming com
pletely involute when /8 is infinite, in which case a = 1. When
the axis is cut by the whorls, as in the case of the Nautilus,
whose shape is best represented by half an ellipse rapidly
rounded into the umbilicus, the inner edge of the major axis
becomes non-existent, /S being imaginary.          It is by the varia
tion of this element alone that such genera as Crioceras and
 Gyroceras are separated from Ammonites and Nautilus. They
are therefore less distinct than Turrilites and Toxoceras, which
 differ in addition by the whorls of the first always cutting

          Curves formed by Cephalopoda and other Mollusles.              247
the axis.      The genus TrocTioceras indeed lies between               them
in this respect.
   7. Similar methods to the above may be adapted to other
generating curves besides the ellipse. For the circle, of course,
we have only to put AC= 1. In many cases no simply expressed
equation can represent the shape ; but there are a few that do
admit of this. Thus, in the Ammonites of the group Cordati
the curve is nearly represented by the cardioid whose equation
is
                             p = a(l+ cos   0).
Here the retardation of the pole from the apex being
            2a=€*cot«(^cot«—    l) = 2ae*cot«     say, and
the equation to such an Ammonite            will be
     8.   It
         is to be noted that, if a plane section through the
middle point of growth have an elliptical or any other curved
outline, the trace on any other plane through the same point
will not be of the same character ; and though the assumption
(say) of an elliptical section in a plane perpendicular to the
direction of growth of the middle point may be as near an
approximation to nature as the one chosen, and the corre
sponding equation may be worked out, yet the results are
quite unmanageable, and have no particular relation to the
laws of growth already enunciated. The curve assumed in
the above investigation is that exposed by a longitudinal sec
tion of the shell through its axis. It has therefore no neces
sary connexion with the form of the aperture, which may be
in another plane, or, indeed, have a curve of double curvature
for its outline.
   This difference is particularly to be noticed in conical shells,
such as the Orthoceras, which correspond to the value «=0.
In these we cannot take a plane through the pole            e. the(i.
apex) as the surface of growth.        Nor can we consider one
side more retarded than the other.      Fundamental differences
are thus revealed between the laws of growth of such shells
and those which are curved. We may, however, connect them
both theoretically and by natural links.      To turn an equian
gular spiral  about  its pole through     given angle
                                             a           to bring
                                                             is
an earlier point in the curve into any particular      radius    so     ;
that the apical angle of        conical shell corresponds to the
                                   a
angle of retardation in      discoid one only in the latter case
                               a                :
the inner curve stops on the extreme radius of the outer, while
in the former      it continued to be of the same length.
                        is                                      In

 248         Rev.  J. F. Blake  on the Measurement   of the

proximately run at a constant distance from the pole, while
the septa approximate to a radial direction.       Thns one law of
 growth is illustrated by the inside and another by the outside.
    9. The several elements of the shell have hitherto been con
 sidered constant; the results of their variation may now be
 indicated.     The rapid increase of « produces such shells as
  (Ekotraustes, a subgenus of Ammonites ; and the rapid diminu
 tion to zero, Scaphites, Ancyloceras, and Lituites. Its more gra
 dual increase with age is shown in Pupa and some Bulimi ;
 and its diminution in many Orthocerata, which are curved in
 youth.      An increase of £ alone produces a more involute shell,
 as many Goniatitce and Bellerophon expansut — and in combi
nation with a decrease of «, shells sucn as Succinea and Siga-
retus.      Its decrease contracts the body-chambers of many
  Orthocerata.     An alteration of 7, combined in some cases with
an alteration of «, takes place in all those Gasteropods whose
whorls cannot all be touched by the same cone, and whose
spire may be called concave or convex. As the former is the
 the commoner of the two, it follows that 7 most often decreases
with age. The changes in Vermetus and Siliquaria seem to be
brought about by an increase in 7 alone.        Its rapid decrease,
on the contrary, bringing it to a negative value, produces the
depressed spires of some Cones and of the Cyprcece,          When
all three vary simultaneously, the effects may be so masked as
 to be ascertainable only by careful measurement.
    In the Cephalopoda, which have part of their shells parti
tioned off, some authors give among the characters both the
 length and the capacity of the body-chamber.        These two are
 evidently deducible from each other, whatever may be the
 shape    of the shell, provided its growth continues constant ;
 for  if the  length of the body-chamber =(1 — *) whole length,
 the capacity =(1 — x3) whole capacity : if therefore it can be
 measured independently, it will show if any contraction or
 expansion has taken place.
    It remains now to show how the three elements of shells
 may best be observed, and especially on imperfect specimens
 such as fossils very commonly are.
     10. To find the spiral angle of a discoid or turbinated shell.
    Since in a turbinated shell all the radii from the apex and
 arcs of thn curve lying on one cone are multiples of their pro
jections on the plane perpendicular to the axis, we need only
 consider discoid forms at first. Let A B C D (fig. 3) be such a
 form ; A C, B D two diameters at right angles through its pole.
 Then, from the properties of the equiangular spiral, it is obvious
that we have a choice of several methods of determining «, by

       Curves formed by Cephalopoda and other Mollusks.                    249
which results may be checked, or the angle ascertained on
small fragments of the shell ; and since the outer and inner
curves have the same angle, observations on either will suffice.

   11. These methods suffice for recent or complete shells ; but
sometimes a fragment of a single whorl is all that is presented
to observation, in which case there are two or three possible
methods.
   1st. Suppose the inner as well as the outer edge of the
whorls preserved, as A B, C D (fig. 4). Then, if we draw any two
parallel tangents, as E G, F                     fi,
                                   the straight line joining the
points  of contact must pass through the pole.      Hence                                GBF
is the angle required.  And even       neither edge be preserved,
                                                       if
any pair of longitudinal stria? or other ornaments will suffice
for the purpose.
   2nd. Let the directions and lengths of       pair of transverse a
ornaments, which we may assume to make the same angle
 with the radius, be available (fig.
                                                                           0,

                            equals the angle between the radii,

terms  of known quantities.
   3rd. Let the outer edge alone be available. Here we have
the simple problem, Given an arc of an equiangular spiral, to
find its pole and spiral angle. This admits of two easy solu
tions —  :

     Curves formed by Cephalopoda and other Mollwks.                251
   (1) Let two tangents DB, DA (fig. 6) be drawn to the
curve. Then, if 0 Be the pole, since 0 A D, 0 B E are equal,
a circle described round DBA will pass through the pole :
this point may thus be determined by the intersection of two
or more such circles and the angle a = D B 0 observed.  This
method, though theoretically simple, requires so much accuracy
in determining the actual points of contact of the tangents as
to be generally inapplicable.
   (2) If pi, pt be the radii of curvature at two points of an
equiangular spiral, and s the arc between them, then
                        cota=
Now the value of pt at A can be very closely approximated to
by measuring the distance AC at which a constant small offset
CD is made by the curve ; and this accuracy may be increased
if the offset be small enough by placing it on both sides of the
point of contact, and assuming the point to be midway between
its two positions. If  AC =#i, and the offset /*,

If 2/w be chosen to be 100 units, the calculation very simple,
                                                         is
and gives results closely concordant with those derived from
the complete shell.
   12. These formulae may be exemplified on Ammonites ob-
tusus.  Two diameters at right angles measured 224 and 188
millims. respectively, whence e2      = 1'19, or R=1'41.    Two
others measured 208 and 176 millims., whence R=1'39.         The
breadths of two whorls along the same diameter measured 76
and 56 millims., whence  R  — 1-39.    Two others were 64 and 46
millims., whence R= 1'39.      Two parallel tangents were drawn
and the points of contact joined     these made an angle of 83^°
                                       ;
with the tangents when cure was taken that the tangents
should be at similar points, the outline of this Ammonite being
slightly polygonal.    With the same precaution, an offset of          5
millims. was 35| millims. on each side of one point of contact:
at another, distant 187 millims. of arc, measured by carefully
rotating the shell along the ruler, the same offset was 32^ mil
lims. on each side; whence cot« = l'079, whence « = 83° 50'.

and    R= 1-41 and taking the mean, we find the angle « = 83° 52'.
This example will illustrate the amount of coincidence that may
be hoped for from careful measurements.
   13. All these methods lead, of course, to erroneous results
when the shell has suffered distortion, except those derived
from measures taken along a single straight line.                   For ex-

 Goniatites, which are often distorted, in which state they

on the two points assumed.           When the section is an ellipse,

whence,      if R
              is known, X and then ft may be deduced ; which
might sometimes be convenient in the case of a fragment. In
this case, however, another method may be followed.                                    If ii

As an example Ammonites margaritatus may be taken. In
one diameter of the septate portion of the shell, of length 166^

gives X = "307 and ft = '432.      In another perpendicular dia

trustworthy, especially if the direction of the radii cannot be
accurately ascertained.
    15. In turbinated shells whose elliptic axis is oblique, we
require to know the retardation of the inner extremity of the
major axis, t. e. the value of ir. This is best done by compa
ring the diameter perpendicular to the axis with the major
axis of the last whorl.        To determine this diameter we must
add the two radii    obtained      from the condition that z shall have
 equal roots in the equation A which correspond to 6 and ff—ir.
This condition gives us
 The smaller of these values corresponds to the radius, if any, of
the open umbilicus, as in § 5 ; the larger is the one we require.

Tlie value of ir may also be calculated from an equation, to be
given hereafter, for determining the angle of elevation y from
the angle of the tangent cone, whenever the value of 7 can be
measured directly.
    16. In the case of the conical shells of the Orthocerata, in
which we can no longer speak of the angle of retardation, but
must measure the apical angle of the cone, the above methods
are not applicable.             Here, however, the apical angle can
always       be  directly   observed   on the sides of the shell : or if it
have a known number of longitudinal ornaments, by taking
that multiple of the angle between two of them and dividing
by 2ir we obtain the sine of half the required angle if the sec
tion be circular.          It may also be obtained for any particular
plane, whatever be the section, by the formula
 if if i, d2 be two diameters in that plane, and * the distance be
tween them measured either on the axis or on the slant side.
 It would be unnecessary to remark that it is the difference
and not the ratio of the diameters which gives us the apical
angle, were it not that this ratio is given by some paleontolo
gists among the shell-characters, where of course it is per
fectly useless.           Methods quite analogous may be used for
curved shells where the pole is known.                  For if with pole as
centre any circle be described cutting the two curves, the angles
between the tangents or between the radii corresponding to
the points of intersection will be the 0 required.               Or if di, dt

    If   the transverse section of a conical shell is elliptical, the
apical angle will not, of course, be the same in the planes of
tne major and minor axis, though, the ratio of these being
constant, one angle may be deduced from the other.                     When
curvature takes place in the plane of the major axis, the curves
 formed by the ends of the minor axis do not lie in one plane,

the major axis being supposed to be perpendicular to the axis
of the shell. This, of course, is not the tangent cone to the
whorls.   It follows that if the curves in the plane of the major
axis remain regular, and yet one plane can be made to touch
the surface at the extremities of all the minor axes, the shell
must either be unsymmetrical or the shape of the section must
vary ; and the latter will certainly be the case when two such
planes can be found. We cannot, therefore, measure the apical
angle of a Cyrtoceras or Dentalium, in a plane perpendicular
to that of the curvature, with perfect accuracy.
   17. When a discoid shell has suffered distortion (that                                                 is,

In this case the two above expressions become respectively
-0071 and '0048. Hence the tapering in the compressed shell
compared is more rapid.                            If
                             a conical shell be perfectly flat
tened and its transverse ornaments become circular arcs, the
length of any semicircumference =va gives the original dia
meter of the shell when circular.

By the compression of the shell  the radii, and therefore the 0's
corresponding to them, will be enlarged and this will take         ;

may be constant. This gives

and cancel the fractions in (6): the rest are not required.
The only important application of these conditions is when a
shell has been completely flattened in shaly beds.       In any case
crumplings    of   the surface  may   be  induced   by resistance   to
lateral expansion, when the expression for the area of      the  com
pressed shell will come out less than it ought ; but if it comes
out greater, the two shells compared could not have had the
same original form.       An example may be take in Ammonites
planorbis, which,    when   uncompressed, has been called Ammo
nites erugatus.     In an example of the latter we find R=1'33,
X=-431; whence by (5) a=-449; and by (2) sin0 = -838.
The last whorl on which these measures were taken was 10-83
millims. in breadth ; .-. 10'833-a = -838a,or a=5'894. The
thickness of the same whorl was 8-33 millims., whence e = -7065.
The elliptic integrals are best observed directly by measure
ment of the arc ; and if the values differ slightly from the
theoretical values, the correction has probably to do with the
deviation of the form from a perfect ellipse. In this case
 = the circumference of the whorl between its intersections
with the inner whorl =26 millims, whence

 Hence the first side of equation (1) becomes 1-071.           In the
flattened shell as seen in the type, R=1'33 and A' ='384,
whence a' = '49 and a' sin 0'=-428.         Also, e' being unity,
       E(e',  -^-J  + E(e',0) =  l + sm0',  and  '.
and
 Hence the second side of the equation reduces to
Now we have seen that

       Curves formed by Cephalopoda and other Mollusks.         261
and by direct measurement we find that
                     E(e,0) + E(e,*,) = 1'037;
whence, from (6),
                     «*f*--*>«*«= M39
(the coefficient on the right-hand side becoming 1 + </).       The
second side of (1) becomes now 1-184.         This value does not
agree sufficiently with 1-071 for the difference to be due to
any errors of observation ; and it follows that Ammonites pla-
norbis was produced from a more involute shell than that called
Ammonites erugatus: and such more involute varieties occur
in the south of England.
   19. To find the angle of elevation in a turbinated shell.
   The point in the tracing-curve whose angle of elevation is
measured must, of course, depend on the shape of that curve.
When it is such as to form a complete cone, as in Eulima, the
angle for any point on the surface is directly measurable.
When the curve is such as the ellipse, the angle measured by
the tangent lines does not correspond to the 7 already used,
but is connected with it by an easily expressed relation ; for
if <u be the semi- vertical angle of the tangent cone, the equa
tion (A) must give equal roots when r cot to is written for z,
which requires that
    tany=    cot<B + 0V/c2(cot<»   cote + l)2 + (coto>— cote)2.
When, as is often the case, «=e, this reduces to

It is obvious that when to and y can both be observed directly,
this gives an equation to find a, as noted in § 15.
   An example of the use of this equation may be taken from
the previously quoted Cyclostoma elegans.         Here
           o-=-46,    o>ss24°,    e=156°,     *= -87315,
whence
                   tan 7=4-874 = tan 78° 24',
the angle derived from direct measurement being
   20. The semi- vertical angle of the cone for any particular
point may also be calculated by means of other angles often
more easily measured. Let ta be such an angle, and i the angle
between the tangent at that point and the axis.        Let AB (80-)
be an element of the curve at that point, DB its projection on
the plane of xy (os).      Then

spiral shells are not absolutely geometrically constant, and all
measures are therefore more or less approximate.
   One example of their use will suffice: this maybe Phasianella

Also B,=1'2; to this value corresponds in the Table 86° 41'.
Substituting these values of o> and ix in ( 1 ) we obtain i = 78° 41'.
Again, substituting in (4) for R and o>, we obtain ^r=91° 36';
by observation the same angle is 92°.          These results are suffi
ciently close to prove the regularity of the shell formation in
this case.
   It has not been thought worth while to study the effects of
compression on turbinated shells, because from their shape no
assumption can be made as to the direction of pressure that
could be considered generally applicable.
XXXIII.      On. the Limits of Hypotheses regarding the Properties
   of the Matter composing the Interior of the Earth. By HENRY
   HENNESSY, F.R.S., Professor of Applied Mathematics in the
   Royal College of Science for Ireland .

          very  moderate knowledge of the materials existing
below the solid crust of the earth. The depth to which we can
penetrate by mining and boring operations into this crust is
comparatively insignificant ; and these operations give us little
knowledge of the earth's interior in comparison with what is
afforded by the outpourings of volcanos.          Two hundred active
volcanos are said to still exist, while geologists have established
that many thousands of such deep apertures in the earth's crust
have existed during remote epochs of its physical history.
The source or sources of supply for all these volcanoes have
poured out a predominating mass of matter in a state of liquidity
from fusion. Evidence is thus furnished that matter in a state
of fluidity exists very widely distributed through the earth.
The supposition that this fluid fills the whole interior, and that
the solid crust is a mere exterior envelope, is usually designated
as the hypothesis of internal fluidity.        From this hypothesis
mechanical and physical results of primary importance in ter
restrial physics may be deduced.
    Newton, Clairaut, Laplace, Airy, and other illustrious ma
thematicians have used an extension of this hypothesis in dis
cussing the earth's figure.      They supposed the particles com-

264         Prof. H. Hennessy on         the Properties    of the
posing the earth to retain the same positions after solidification
as that which they held before it.             I  ventured, for the first
time, to discard the latter portion of the hypothesis as useless
and contrary to physical laws.           I  now venture to say that, in
framing any hypotheses          as   to the   physical character of the
matter of the earth, we should not afhx any property to the
supposed matter which is opposed to the properties observed in
similar kinds of matter coming under our direct observation.
Observation has disclosed that liquids are in general viscid,
and that they possess what has been designated internal fric
tion in a high degree *. Observation has recently shown that
among the three states of matter (gaseous, liquid, and solid)
a law of continuity exists.            Observation also discloses that
gases   and   vapours are,   of  all  forms   of matter, the most com
pressible, that liquids are much less compressible, and that
solids are still less compressible. Thus, for instance, water is
about fourteen times more compressible than copper or brass.
    2.  If these general comparative properties of liquids and
solids are admitted, it follows that in the hypotheses regarding
the earth's internal structure we should most carefully guard
against any assumption directly in contradiction to such pro
perties. By assuming that the earth contained a fluid totally
devoid of viscidity and internal friction, the late Mr. Hopkins
attempted to prove the earth's entire solidity.             He only proved
that it did not contain any of this imaginary fluid ; but he by
no means proved the non-existence of a liquid possessing the
properties of viscidity and internal friction common to all
liquids.     In the Comptes Rendus of the Academy of Sciences
of Paris for 1871 is a paper in which           I have given a rdsumdof
the arguments against Mr. Hopkins,s conclusions as to the
earth's complete solidity ; and in the subsequent discussions
my priority on this matter seems to have been fairly and
honourably acknowledged f. In a recent admirable work on
 Geology, PfafPs Grundriss der Geologie, the author gives a
brief account of the bearing of astronomical and mathematical
investigations on the internal structure of the earth; and he
very justly says that the results of observation compel us to
regard the earth as for the most part fluid, in order to bring
these results into harmony with calculation.               Professor Pfaff

attributes this conclusion to Hopkins, whereas it is precisely
                 I
that which had long since enunciated, and is entirely opposed
to the views of Mr. Hopkins. More recently Sir William
Thomson and Mr. Darwin have investigated the tidal action of
an internal fluid nucleus upon its containing solid shell. They
have both supposed the liquid to be totally incompressible, and
the containing vessel to be elastic and therefore compressible.
They have thus given the liquid a property which no liquid in
existence possesses, and the solid a property which solids pos
sess in a much less degree than liquids. Their hypothesis is thus
 totally inadmissible as a part of the problem of inquiry into the
 earth s structure.       I
                          at once admit that a tliin elastic spheroidal
 envelope   filled with  incompressible liquid and subjected to the
 attractions of exterior bodies would present periodical defor
 mations, owing to tidal action far surpassing the tides of the
 ocean.              I
           But do not admit that such impossible substances
 can represent the materials of the earth.           My hypothesis is
 that the liquid interior matter, instead of being incompressible,
 is, like all liquids we observe, relatively far more compressible
 than its solid envelope.       A highly compressible liquid con
 tained in a very much less-compressible shell would be           a hy
 pothesis   more    in harmony    with   physical   observation.    The
 tidal phenomena of           compressible fluid,
                               a                   it   is easy to see,
 would he very different from those of an incompressible fluid.
 The work done by the action of certain disturbing bodies in
 the strata of compressible fluid would partly result in causing
  variations of density, instead of producing tidal waves of great
 magnitude.       This has been already shown in the Af&anique
  Cdleste   by  Laplace, in discussing the tides of the atmosphere.
  Theory shows that the atmospheric tides should be nearly in
  sensible, notwithstanding the great depth of the atmospheric
  column, because the work done in the atmosphere            isvery dif
  ferent from what       peformed in the less-compressible water of
                         is
  the ocean.     Observation has fully verified this result.
       3.It admitted that the earth's density increases from its
            is
  surface towards its centre.      If  its interior     occupied by a
                                                       is
  compressible fluid, the law of density of this fluid would result
  from the compression of its own strata; just as the law of density
  of the atmosphere        produced by the pressure of the upper
                          is
  atmospheric layers upon those below.          But instead of suppo
  sing the interior of the earth to be filled by a fluid thus con
  forming to the observed properties of fluids, both Sir William
  Thomson and Mr. Darwin have applied their great powers as
  accomplished mathematicians to the tides of an incompressible
  and homogeneous spheroid, such as     I     admit to have no real
  existence whatsoever.

    4. The labour bestowed on the problem investigated could
scarcely be considered at all necessary or fruitful, except as
affording an admirable illustration of the results flowing from
the employment of hypotheses framed in direct contradiction
to the fundamental conditions to which every truly philoso
phical hypothesis must conform.           It is scarcely necessary to
add, that the conclusions of Mr. Darwin, as well as those of
 Sir William Thomson, cannot be considered as having invali
dated the carefully framed hypothesis that the earth consists
of a solid crust physically similar to the rocks we are enabled
to observe, and a contained spheroid of liquid matter partaking
of the established properties of liquids, and physically similar
to the liquid rock poured out by volcanic openings.
    5. It is with much satisfaction that         I can trace a gradual
growth    of more   correct physical views   on the  questions referred
to in this paper.      In ' Nature,' vol. v. p. 288, a paper appeared
            I
in which ventured to criticise Sir William Thomson's memoir
on the Rigidity of the Earth, in the ' Philosophical Transac
tions.'    At the Meeting of the British Association in Glasgow,
Sir William Thomson acknowledged the invalidity of many of
his arguments, and requested his audience to draw their pens
through paragraphs from 23 to 31 in his paper.              These para
graphs contain statements and reasonings which           I  had already
shown to be inconclusive in the paper which has just been
quoted.
    In Mr. Darwin's paper, recently communicated to the Bri
tish Association, he admits that in discussing the precessional
and tidal phenomena of a viscous liquid, the supposition of an
elastic spheroid would lead to very different results — -that is to
say, results very different from those deduced by himself and Sir
William Thomson regarding the earth's structure, and which
the followers of the late Sir Charles Lyell have frequently
assumed to be established.        Thus the late Mr. Poulett Scrope
appears to have referred to the bearing of the mathematical
                                                      "
investigations alluded to, on what he calls the sensational
      "
idea of an internal incandescent fluid beneath the solid crust
of the earth. He forgot that an idea may not be the less true
because it is sensational.      The idea of antipodes was at one
time regarded as highly sensational. Those who witness a
great earthquake or a volcanic eruption are usually impressed
with the sensational character of the phenomena.

since, met a woman over one hundred years of age, and asked
her if she recollected the great earthquake of Lisbon.              She
replied, that    it was  the  event of   all  others  in her   long life
which she ought to vividly recollect, on account of its impres

of the destruction of Pompeii.                   If

  To   the   Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      GENTLEMEN,
       the series of articles which Mr. Norman Lockyer is pub
IN    lishing in the columns of Nature,' entitled " Physical
                                      '
Science for Artists," he broaches an explanation of certain
effects of aerial perspective and sky-colour, which appears to
me inconsistent in itself.      It moreover, entirely at variance
                                           is,
with the explanation which         believe to be generally accepted
                                       I
by those who have thought about the matter, ana which                          is
stated without any reserve by Professor Helmholtz in the last
volume of his popular lectures published in 1876, in            lecture
                                                                      a

well-deserved authority         and;         it       is,

scientific readers (since he writes for artists) a novel expla
nation of his own, without at least indicating that there            an   is
entirely different and generally accepted explanation of the
phenomena of which he speaking for he alludes
                                  is              ;             (p.

to Dr. Tyndall's conclusion as someiohat similar to his own.
I    wish specially to draw attention to the apparent incon
sistency of his explanation of the blue colour of the air so fre
quently seen between the observer and distant mountain.     a
   In No. of the series (May 30) he explains that gold
             4                                                                 is
yellow because, out of the white light which enters             it,
                                                              the com
ponents at each end of the spectrum are absorbed in their trans
mission into the mass of metal, and so there remain over only
the middle rays, which,      transmitted, appear green,
                                  if                         reflected,
                                                                if
yellow, owing     to the  greater quantity    of the light.     Clearly
he regards the colour of gold as green (or yellow), because
the other colours are absorbed.         He then quotes from Pro
fessor Stokes's admirable South-Kensington              Lecture, and
accepts   his conclusion,  that    poppy
                                       a     red  because
                                                       is   out of the

268                Mr. A. M. Worthington     on the
white light that enters it and emerges from it to be reflected,
only the red survives absorption ; the rest is absorbed in the
interior of the leaf.
    So far, beyond his own explanation of the molecular group
ings which cause this selective absorption, Mr. Lockyer has
advanced nothing new ; he has dealt only with what are called
" natural bodies. ' But in No. 6 of June 6th, he apparently
applies the explanation of the colours of natural bodies to the
colour of the air between the observer and a distant hill ; and
here   I cannot follow him.
    He says, page 155,    § 2 :
                                —
    " We   are in the presence of aqueous vapour competent to
be set    in vibration by blue light, and because it vibrates in
this way it appears blue."       And in the next paragraph: —
    " If the stratum of aqueous vapour had had a oackground
of bright sky, it would have absorbed the blue light of that
sky.     By virtue of the principles which   I have stated, the sky
would have appeared red in consequence of the abstraction of
blue light."
    Mr. Lockyer here clearly regards the molecules as abstract
ing the blue rays ; as being set in synchronous vibration by
them, and therefore sending blue light to the eye.          He can
hardly mean that the phenomenon is one of selective absorp
tion and emission, for no vapour emits visible light until its
temperature is very high : indeed there seems no doubt that
he considers the air to appear blue by reflected light ; for he
 says, speaking of similar water-vapour, on page 156, §§2 and
3: —" Let us consider, then, the action of those molecules which
absorb the blue light.
    " Now, since these molecules absorb blue light, we know that
they will reflect blue light, and, practically speaking, nothing
else.    Here, then, we have the cause for the blue colour of
 the sky."
    Why I Mr. Lockyer has himself explained that gold is
yellow beceuse it absorbs the red and blue and reflects the
 yellow light ; that a poppy is red because it absorbs all but
 the red ; and now he says that water-vapour is blue because
 it absorbs blue.
    Apart from the inconsistency of this explanation,      I do not
 think that, as a matter of fact, Professor Stokes's explanation
 of the colours of " natural bodies " can be applied to the ap
 pearance of a mass of air in which particles of aqueous vapour
 are suspended.      The following is what Professor Helmholtz
 says  of  the same phenomenon, translated from the lecture        I
 have mentioned.      On page 65, § 3, he says: — " Under the head
 of aerial perspective we understand the optical effect of the

                      Blue Colour of the Sky.                         269
appearance of light proceeding from the illuminated mass of
air lying between the spectator and a distant object. This
appearance of light is due to a slight turbidity, from which
the atmosphere is never quite free.       Whenever there are scat
tered through a transparent medium small transparent particles
whose density and ability to deviate the light are different
from those of the medium, these particles turn aside out of its
direct course any light which falls upon them in traversing
the medium, and, partly by reflection and partly by refraction,
'          '
  disperse   it in all directions, to use an expression of optics."
After mentioning, as sources of turbidity in the air, dust, smoke,
organic matter, w^ater-vapour on the point of condensation,
and the presence of hot and cold currents of air, he goes on
to say that, as regards the cause of turbidity in the higher
and drier regions of the atmosphere, which produces the blue
light of the sky, whether we have to do here with particles of
foreign matter, or whether the molecules of the air itself act
as a turbidity in the aether, science has no certain information
to give.
   "As regards, however, the colour of the light reflected by the
disturbing particles," he resumes, "this depends practically on
their size.    When a log of wood floats on water, and we excite
small  wave   rings by letting a drop of water fall near        it,
                                                                these
waves are reflected by the floatmg log as though            itwere a
fixed wall.     But in the long waves of the sea, such a log of
wood would be tossed up and down without the form of the
waves being materially altered in their progress.          Now light
alsois  known to be an nndulatory motion transmitted through
the aether that fills space.     The red and yellow rays have the
longest  waves,   the  violet and  blue the shortest.    Very small
bodies disturbing     the  continuity of the aether will therefore
reflect the latter rays notably more than the former. In fact,
the finer the disturbing particles are, the bluer the light of the
turbid medium   ;     while larger particles reflect more equally
light of every colour, and for this reason cause whiter tur
                                                        a
bidity.     Of such kind is   the blue of the sky, i.e. of the turbid
atmosphere seen against black space.           The purer and more
transparent the air, the bluer the sky.          In like manner        it
becomes bluer and darker        when  we  ascend a high mountain,
partly because the air high up     is  freer from turbidity, partly
because there   is, of course, less air above onr head. But the
same blue which we see before the dark background of space,
appears also before terrestrial objects, e.g. distant mountains
in shadow or wooded, whenever       a    thick layer of illuminated
air lies between them and us.          It is  the same air-light'
                                                            c
which makes both sky and mountain blue only in the former
                                               ;

case it is pure ; in the latter it is mixed with other light pro
ceeding from the objects behind, and moreover belongs to the
coarser turbidity of the lower layers of the atmosphere, for
which reason it is whiter.       In the drier air of warmer coun
 tries the turbidity is finer, even in the lower strata of the at-
 mosphere, and hence the blue seen before distant terrestrial
objects is more like that of the sky.      It is to this circumstance
that Italian landscapes owe their clearness and richness of
colour."     I fail to detect in this explanation, which was origi
         I
nally, believe, due to Dr. Tyndall, the slightest resemblance
to that of Mr. Lockyer.

    The hydrodynamical equation of pressure for irrotational

    Let us now apply this equation to the case of a resonator

neither the variation of pressure nor the velocity is sensible,

    the constant logarithmic pressure at a distance.  Equation (5)

XXXVI.     On certain Phenomena accompanying Rainbows. By
   SILVAOTS P. THOMPSON, D.Sc.,B.A., F.R.A.S., Professor of
   Experimental Physics in University College, Bristol*.
        literature of the Rainbow is somewhat extensive ; yet
The I do     not recollect having anywhere seen any record of
certain phenomena, of radial streaks of light, which are occa
sionally to be seen accompanying rainbows.           I
                                                    am convinced
that the phenomenon is not rare ; and in the desire of inducing
more observers to watch for its occurrence,      Ibeg to present
the few notes which follow.       On the evening of July 8th,
 1877, I  stood with a friend upon the summit of the Drachen-
fels about an hour before sunset.     To the south and south
east the sky was obscured by dark masses of cloud ; and the
sky above us and to the north and west was covered with
broken clouds : there was no perceptible wind.             A fine
rainbow spanned the valley, and extended eastwards toward the
Lowenberg.       Both primary and secondary bows were fine ;
and several supernumeraries were noticed. As the bow faded
away a faint streak of light was observed, not unlike the
streak of an aurora, outside the right limb of the secondary
bow, extending up to          it,
                             about 12° of arc long by 2° wide,
and making an angle of about 15° with the horizon.       It lasted
fully ten minutes, maintaining nearly same position and form.
It was perfectly free from colour. A similar, fainter streak
was observed on the left limb at about 70° to the horizon.
Standing upon the very summit of the Drachenfels, the pro
file of the nil! and our shadows were rudely projected upon
the nearest hillside ;    was very easy, therefore, to verify that
                         it
these streaks were really radial in direction.     Each of them,
if produced backwards, would have passed through the point
of space exactly opposite the sun.
    July 15th, 1877, after very wet and stormy day, we ob
                               a
served, from the promenade in front of the Schweitzerhof at
Lucerne,   a  very fine rainbow at sunset.     The colours were
unusually brilliant. Seven supernumeraries of the primary
bow were distinctly visible, and one of the secondary.        The
clouds behind presented      uniform deep grey tint. A colour
                              a
less streak was visible within the primary bow, radial in posi
tion and at about 45° to the left.
    July 16th, 1877, about 6.30 P.M., from the high road near
Sarnen, the same observers watched the same phenomenon.
The day was thundery and with frequent showers and gusts
from the north.      A very fine and complete bow was seen,

partly against the sky, partly against the hills which bound
on the south-east the high road from Alpnach.            At intervals
several radial streaks were observed both interior and exterior
to the rainbow.      They shifted position and magnitude rapidly.
It was noticeable that to each streak corresponded a patch of
sunshine on the hills behind, each streak pointing to a patch
and moving with it.
   Three times in June 1878 1 observed at Bristol similar phe
nomena accompanying rainbows, though not so favourably.
   The explanation which is suggested by the observation made
at Sarnen is very simple.       These wedge-shaped radial streaks
are "beams" of sunlight, and become visible by diffuse re
flexion from particles of matter in their path, just as the appa
rently divergent beams of sunrise or sunset become visible.
These " beams
                  "
                     being practically parallel to one another,
appear to converge in the point exactly opposite the sun by
perspective ; or, in fact, just as the parallel beams of sunsot
appear divergent.       Since the rainbow has for its centre the
point opposite the sun, such beams must necessarily have
positions radial with respect to the bow.            They resemble,
                "

east at sunset, or in the west at sunrise.
   Here let me mention one peculiarity of the radial streaks,
in which they appear to differ from the "rayons du cr^-
puscnle."  I have never observed a " streak
                                                "
                                                  crossing the dusky
region between the primary and secondary bows, though have             I
seen one and the same streak extend beyond the bows both
outside the secondary and inside the primary.

                                                          have never
seen a    streak     of colourless light cross the coloured part of
a rainbow.     I have noticed a faint bow crossed by a streak ;
where the streak crossed         the bows (primary, secondary, and
                                     it,
supernumerary)      became   more   vivid.   There was more light           ;
but it   was dispersed- in the usual way, and the intermediate
region between the bows was no brighter where the streak
crossed it.    I conclude, then, that such a streak          the very
                                                                  is
stuff, so to  speak,   of  which   rainbows   are  made    only when
                                                              ;
the neighbouring regions are obscured by clouds,         the  beam of
light which struggles through builds up its own portion of the
arch in its appropriate place.
   Two not dissimilar phenomena (quite independent of the
rainbow) appear to confirm this conclusion.            Stand in the
sunlight, when the sun        high, so that the shadow of your head
                                is
falls upon the surface of slightly turbid pond or lake, whose

  Thames     I have often observed this.         The waves or ripples of
  the   surface cause the sun's rays to enter the water with
  unequal intensities at different points. At certain points the
 l>eams will enter almost without loss by reflexion, and will be
 traceable by their illuminating the particles of the turbid
 water. These beams will be nearly parallel to one another ;
 but as they all retreat from the observer, they will appear to
 converge to a point exactly opposite the sun ; to a point within
 the shadow of his head, in fact, giving the nimbus effect.
     The other analogous phenomenon requires to be explained
 by reflexion.        If  you stand upon a ridge, or a high wall in
 the sunlight, so that your shadow falls upon a field of waving
 corn, you will notice that the corn-field appears to be illumi
 nated in the region all round the shadow of your head.               This
 is best seen when travelling by railway, with the sun about
 50° above the horizon, from the top of an embankment, so
 that the shadow of the train and observer fall upon the corn
 fields below.

 XXXVII.         On   the principal Screws of Inertia of a Free or Con
     strained Rigid Body.         By ROBERT S. BALL, LL.D., F.R.S.,
     Royal Astronomer of Ireland*.

        impulse upon        a
                                     propose to treat of the effect of an
                              quiescent rigid body, so far as the initial
movement of the body is concerned.              The analytical investiga
tion of this problem is so well known, that I do not propose to
enter into that subject at present.            I  believe, however, that
the ordinary method of viewing the question may be supple
mented by the purely geometrical or physical treatment which
I   shall endeavour to sketch. This geometrical aspect of the
problem, as it has presented itself to my mind, has been de
veloped in the course of certain researches in the dynamics of
a rigid body which            I  have ventured to call the Theory of
Screws.       I  shall here indicate the more salient points of this
theory which are necessary for the present question.
    The most important feature of the geometrical method of
viewing the subject is its extreme naturalness, as well as the
wide generality with which the problem is grasped.                 If  the
rigid body were perfectly free, the questions presented are
comparatively simple, so much so that there is not a great deal
of interest attached to the investigation.           But when we con
sider the case of a rigid body whose movements are more or

less constrained, the problems possess a high degree of geo
metrical interest. It is also the occasion of some surprise that,
notwithstanding the infinite variety of conceivable constraints
(such as fixed points, axes, contact with fixed surfaces, ar
rangements of link-work and the like) by which the move
ments of the rigid body may be hampered, their geometrical
classification is of the utmost simplicity.         It will be shown
that there are six. fundamental descriptions of constraint,
which include every conceivable arrangement, from leaving the
body absolutely free on the one hand, or absolutely immovable
on the other. With the investigation of these fundamental
forms of constraint we may fitly commence our inquiry.
    In the first place, it is to be observed that, as the constraints
limit the movements of a body, we may adequately describe
the nature of those constraints either by pointing out all the
movements of the rigid body which are prohibited, or, on the
other hand, by ascertaining all the movements which are per
mitted.    It is obviously more to the purpose to adopt the latter
method of viewing the subject ; and therefore we shall proceed
to indicate the method by which a complete inventory may be
made of the possible movements which a rigid body can
execute.     It is also to be continually borne in mind that we
are only considering the initial movements of the body, and that,
consequently, it is only necessary to consider movements which
 are of indefinitely small 'magnitude.
    Let it therefore be supposed that the rigid body is submitted
 to our examination when it occupies a definite position A. We
are not now going to apply the impulsive forces to it ; we are
at present merely making a preliminary trial of a purely geo
metrical or kinematical character of its capability for displace
 ment. It is at once perceived that the body, not being fixed,
 can be moved into many closely adjacent positions.         Take any
 one of these positions and call it B.
    By a celebrated theorem of Chasles it is known that the
 displacement of the body from A to B can be produced by
 translating the body parallel to a certain line, and at the same
 time rotating the body about the same line.       We may, for con
 venience, speak of this motion as a tw ist ; and we may term
 the angle of rotation the amplitude of the twist.      The distance
 of the translation is proportional to the amplitude of the twist,
 and may be taken to be equal to the product of the amplitude
 of the twist and a certain linear magnitude called the pitch.
 The axis about which the rotation is made, associated with the
 linear magnitude termed the pitch, constitute what is called a
 screw.    We therefore say that the displacement of the rigid
 body from A to B is effected by a twist about a screw.

276              Dr. R. S. Ball on      the     principal Screws of Inertia
     It is to be observed that the twist involves two elements,
t. e. a graphic element (the screw), and a metric element (the
amplitude of the twist).        A little reflection will show that the
constraints which permit displacement from A to B must also
admit of any infinitely small twist being made upon the screw
defined by A and B. We may therefore say that the body is
 free to twist about the screw (A, B).                         If
                                                    we find on exami-
tion that the body cannot be displaced to- any position except
those which could be attained by twists of suitable amplitude
about the screw (A, B), then we can assert that the body has
only one degree of freedom ; and that freedom is perfectly ex
pressed by the capacity to twist on one definite screw.
    It is easy to verify in particular cases the general principle
 that, no matter what the constraints be, a body which has but
one degree of freedom can twist about a certain screw and
can have no other movements.             For example, a body free to
rotate about an axis, but not to slide along                         it,
                                                        can only twist
about a screw of which the pitch              zero, oris   body free toa
slide along an axis, but not to rotate around                        it,
                                                         can only twist
about     a screw whose pitch      infinite.

normals to the surfaces, and regard them as the rays of                              a

                                   it
being able to twist about a certain screw a, was also able to
twist about       second screw

                                      then twisting about an in
finite number of other screws must also be possible. For
the position attained by       twist about a, followed by twist
                                        a                                        a

are arbitrary,        obvious that

                of a Free or Constrained Rigid Body.             277
    A body which has two degrees of freedom is therefore able
to twist about all the screws which lie upon a cylindroid. This
is true, no matter what be the nature of the constraints.          It
is a matter worthy of notice       that notwithstanding the infinite
variety of constraints which would permit a body to have two
degrees of freedom, that freedom must still be completely de
fined by a cylindroid, although all cylindroids are similar sur
faces, and possess no variety except as to absolute size.          It
should also be remarked that the pitches of the screws on the
cylindroid are proportional to the inverse squares of the paral
lel diameters of a certain conic.
    If  it be found that a body can be twisted about three screws
which do not lie upon the same cylindroid, then the body must
be capable of being twisted about a doubly infinite number of
screws.       Of this doubly infinite number three pass through
each point in space, all the screws of given pitch lie upon a
hyperboloid, and all the screws parallel to a plane lie upon a
cylindroid. The pitch of each screw of the system is propor
 tional to the inverse square of the parallel diameter of a certain
 quadric called the pitch-quadric ; and the pitch-quadric is
 itself the locus of the screws of zero pitch. The entire sys
tem is determined when the pitch-quadric is known.            These
kinematical theorems are intimately connected with Pliicker's
 geometrical speculations on a system of three linear complexes.
     Included in the case of freedom of the third order, we have
 the celebrated problem where a body is rotating around a
 point.     In this case, however, the pitch-quadric assumes an
evanescent form, and the general conception of the capabilities
of a body which has freedom of the third order are very much
degraded.
    If   a body be able to twist about four screws which do not
 all belong to such a system as that we have just been describing,
 then the body must be able to twist about a trebly infinite
 number of screws.        A cone of screws of this system passes
 through     each point  of  space ; and the cone may be drawn by
 letting fall perpendiculars from the point upon the generators
 of a cylindroid.      It is remarkable that these cones are of the
 second order ; and it can also be shown that the feet of their
 perpendiculars upon the generators of the cylindroid are in
 the same plane. It is thus to be observed that the capabilities
 of motion possessed by a body which has freedom of the fourth
 order are completely determined when a certain cylindroid is
 given in size and position ; for then all the cones are deter
mined.
    In    the  case where a body can twist about five screws
 not belonging      to a system such as that we have just been

278           Dr. B. S. Ball on              the   principal Screws of Inertia
describing, then the system of screws is quadruply infinite ; in
fact, the body can then twist about one screw of a certain pitch
on every line in space.
    Finally, if the body can twist about six screws not belong
ing to the system just mentioned, then the body has freedom
of the sixth order, and                is,
                                 in fact, perfectly free.
    We thus see that, corresponding to each order of freedom,                                a
certain group of screws                is
                                 appropriate      and we may call such
                                                             ;
a group      screw-system
              a              for  the  sake of  brevity.   Thus, in the
case of freedom of the second order the screw-system             a cylin-          is
droid     in the case of freedom of the fourth order the screw-
          ;
system consists of all the screws of proper pitch which inter
sect a generator of a cylindroid at right angles, and so on.
    By this preliminary investigation we are enabled to dismiss
entirely all further mention of the constraints. Every con
ceivable form of constraints can only give the body permission
to twist about one of the six types                         of
                                                 screw-system.       have           I
not in this brief summary attempted to give any demonstra
tions of the different theorems involved.           For these, reference

 tain how the body will move when              receives an impulse.

    It will, however, be first necessary to consider the most
 general form of impulse which the body can receive. Now
it   iswell known that all the forces acting upon a rigid body
 may be reduced to        single force, and a couple in plane per
                               a                                               a
 pendicular   to  that force.     The efficiency of the couple        ex                is
 pressed by its moment         and the moment
                                     ;                  the product of    is                 a
 force and     linear magnitude.
                  a                     It will not be unnatural to as
 sociate this force and couple with the conception of the screw,
 already introduced.       We may use the expression wrench to
 denote     force along
              a              screw and
                                   a        couple in a plane perpen
                                                        a
 dicular to the screw, the moment of the couple being equal to
 the product of the force and the pitch of the screw.               Thus,
 every system of force acting upon a rigid body constitutes a
 wrench upon a screw and       ;   is completely determined when the
                                         it
 screw on the one hand, and the force on the other, are both given.
    The analogy subsisting between the twist and the wrench,
 as implied by their mutual connexion with the abstract geo
 metrical conception of screw, will be the main source of the
                                     a
theorems now to be enunciated.
    The original problem has now been brought into this con
 dition.    On the one hand, we have a body whose freedom                                    is

             of a Free or Constrained Rigid Body.                      279
expressed by a certain screw-system ; and, on the other hand,
we have    a group of impulsive forces which constitute a
wrench on wnat may be called the impulsive screw.       Now,
in consequence of this impulse the body will commence to
move ; but the only motion it can execute must be to twist
about some screw of its screw-system ; there must therefore
be in the screw-system a certain instantaneous screw corre
sponding to each impulsive screie.      If   the impulsive screw be
given, the instantaneous screw is determined ; but the converse
is not true. In fact, the instantaneous screw is limited to the
screw-system, whereas the impulsive screw may be anywhere
in the universe and with any pitch.        It however, possible to
                                             is,
clear away this ambiguity in a very satisfactory manner. It
can be shown that, whenever the body         is not quite free, there
are a group of impulsive screws corresponding to each instan
taneous screw.       It not here necessary for us to enter into
                      is
the properties of these groups of impulsive screws, further
than to remark that,   if      abody receive an impulsive wrench
upon any     one  of  the screws   belonging to this group,       will
                                                                  it
commence to twist about        the instantaneous screw to which the
group  is  correlated. In each group of impulsive screws there
is one screw which merits most particular attention.           It can
 be proved that in each of these groups there            always one
                                                        is
 screw (but only one) which not only belongs to the group but
 also belongs to the screw-system expressing the freedom of the
 body. It therefore follows that the effect of an impulsive wrench
 anywhere in space could have been produced by an impulsive
 wrench on screw suitably chosen from among the members
             a
 of the screw-system itself. We need therefore only consider
 the effect of impulsive wrenches upon screws which actually
 belong to the screw-system.
    In this way the ambiguity has been dissipated without any
 sacrifice of generality   :  to each screw of the system regarded
 as an instantaneous screw corresponds another screw of the
 complex regarded as an impulsive screw, and vice versa.
    The study of this system of correspondence between the im
 pulsive screw and the instantaneous screw of the same screw-
 complex, leads to many results of considerable interest, not
  only on account of their great generality, but also on account
 of their geometrical character. It     is   natural to consider, in
 the first place, whether there are any common elements in the
 two corresponding systems         ; and we are thus led to the dis
 covery   that when   a rigid  body has freedom    the nth order, then
                                                   of
 n screws can be selected from the screw-system expressing that
freedom such that,  if  the body receive an impulsive wrench on any
 one of these screws, the body will commence to twist about the
 same screw.    These are called the principal screws      inertia.

  280     On tlie Inertia of a Free or Constrained  Rigid Body.
     We shall illustrate the existence of these principal screws
 of inertia by pointing them out in the particular cases of
 freedom of the second and third orders.         When the body has
 freedom of the second order, the screw-system is a cylindroid.
 All   the generators of a cylindroid are parallel to a plane ; and
 by   the anharmonic ratio of four generators is to be understood
 the anharmonic ratio of four parallel rays drawn through any
 point.      Now it can be shown that the anharmonic ratio of four
 instantaneous screws on the cylindroid is equal to the anhar
 monic ratio of the four corresponding impulsive screws. When,
 therefore, three impulsive screws and the three corresponding
 instantaneous screws are known, the instantaneous screw
 corresponding to any impulsive screw is at once determined
 by geometry. The double rays of the two equianharmonic
 systems must of course be parallel to the two principal screws
 of inertia on the cylindroid ; and thus the problem of finding
 the principal screws of inertia for freedom of the second order
 is completely solved.
     In the case of freedom of the third order, the three principal
 screws of inertia can also be completely determined by geo
 metry.       For this purpose it is necessary to construct a certain
ellipsoid, which is defined by the following theorem.
     The kinetic energy of a rigid body when twisting with a
given twist velocity about any screw of a screw-system of the
third order is proportional to the inverse square of the paral
lel diameter of a certain ellipsoid.
    If  this ellipsoid be made concentric with the pitch-quadric,
it will be possible to draw a triad of common conjugate dia
meters to the two surfaces ; and the required principal screws of
inertia are the three screws of the complex which are parallel
to these conjugate diameters.
    In that special case of freedom of the third order in which
a body is rotating about a fixed point, then the general pro
perty of the three principal screws of inertia degrades to the
well-known property of the principal axes.            It will be ob
served that the theory here propounded may be considered to
generalize the property of the principal axes into a general
property for freedom of the third order, and then further into
a property for freedom of any order.
    We conclude by pointing out the six principal screws of
inertia of a perfectly free rigid body.           They are found as
follows : — Draw the three principal axes, A, B, C, through the
centre of gravity, and let a, b, c be the radii of gyration; then
two screws on A with the pitches +a, — a, and two similar
screws on B and on C, constitute the six principal screws of
inertia.

XXXVIII.        On  the  Discharge of Water from Orifices at diffe
   rent Temperatures.       By Professor W. C. UNWIND. I.C.E*
IN thereJournalpaper
       the
              is a
                        of the  Franklin Institute for May 1878,
                            by Chief-Engineer Isherwood, of the
U.S. Navy, giving an account of some experiments on the
discharge of water from orifices at different temperatures.
Those experiments appear to have been made on a sufficient
scale and with very great care ; and they lead to the conclusion
that temperature has a very marked influence on the discharge.
The author evidently supposes his conclusions to be applicable
                                                   "
to orifices in general ; for he remarks that, in the various de
terminations which have been made of the ratio of the actual
to the theoretical discharge of water through orifices, the tem
perature of the water should have been noted. The experi
mental ratios are true for only the experimental temperatures,
and need reduction to a standard temperature."
   The experiments were made by noting the time in which
the level of the water in a cylindrical vessel fell from one level
to another, the water being discharged from a given orifice.
The observed results of the experiments are not given.              These
results were plotted in a diagram, and a fair curve drawn pass
ing as evenly as possible through the plotted points. The
results are stated to have been corrected for the dilatation of
the orifice by heat ; but it is not stated whether any correction
was made for the dilatation of the volume of the vessel from
which the water flowed, a correction quite as important as the
other. The following short Table gives a few of Mr. Isher-
wood's results, as measured by him from the curve represent
ing the observed results : —
           Temperature,       .Relative time    Relative velocities

               212                0-8855             M293
Thus the velocity of discharge increases 12 per cent, as the
temperature rises from 32° to 212°, and it increases 8 per
cent, as the temperature rises from 60 to 180°.
   Now there is this difficulty in accepting the results of Mr.
Isherwood's experiments, —that the actual velocity of discharge
at ordinary temperatures differs from the whole velocity due
to the head by only from 3 to 6 per cent, for simple orifices.

282       Prof. W. C. Unwin on      the  Discharge of Water
It is not easy to see that any increase of fluidity of the water
or diminution of friction could do more than annul this loss of
from 3 to 6 per cent.      Mr. Isherwood's experiments seem to
imply that the velocity of discharge at high temperatures may
be greater than the velocity due to the head.          It seemed worth
while therefore to repeat the experiment. The means at the
author's disposal did not permit him to make the experiments
on quite so large a scale as those of Mr. Isherwood ; but it
was, he believes, quite large enough to indicate any gain of
velocity of the amount mentioned above.
   A cast-iron cistern was used, the interior bored out to a
diameter of 0'4 metre.      The first orifice tried was a carefully
formed brass conoidal orifice, formed as nearly as might be to
the shape of the vena contracts, and very approximately O'Ol
metre diameter.      Three pointed indexes were fixed in the cis
tern, below the surface of the water ; so that, as the level of
the water descended, the instant at which the point broke the
surface could be very exactly observed.           Calling the levels of
the three indexes A, B, and C, the time was noted in which
the water-level descended from A to B and from A to C.                   A
 chronograph-watch     was  used, the   seconds'   hand    being   started
 at the moment the water-level was at A. When the level
 reached B, the time elapsed was noted by an observer count
 ing seconds. When the level reached C the hand of the watch
 was stopped.     This last observation was perhaps more reliable
 than the  intermediate one at the level B.
    For the higher temperatures the water was taken from a
 steam-engine boiler ; it was somewhat discoloured by iron
 and sediment.     The same water was used in the experiments
 at lower temperatures, but in its ordinary clean condition.
 The author does not think that the condition of the water made
 any sensible difference in the results of the experiments.

   These results show a distinct increase of velocity of dis
charge at the higher temperatures ; but the increase from 60°
to 190° is only 4 per cent., or less than half the increase ob
served by Mr. Isherwood.
    When water issues from an orifice with gradually diminish
ing head, the relation between the time and volume of dis
charge is given by the well-known equation
where    fl = area of water-surface in reservoir,

    The experiments on a conoidal orifice having shown a small
but definite influence of temperature on the discharge, it
seemed desirable to try whether a similar effect would be pro
duced in the case of a thin-edged orifice.           With the conoidal
orifice there is no contraction of the jet, and the discharge is
 less than the so-called theoretical discharge by an amount de
pending only on the friction of the orifice.              In the case of
a thin-edged orifice,   the   jet contracts to      an   area of about
that of the orifice ; and the discharge is diminished not only

temperature increasing the contraction at the same time as it
diminishes the friction, could only be determined by much
more extensive experiments.

   These results seem to show that the temperature has hardly
any sensible influence on the discharge from orifices of this
kind.
   It will be seen that the results of these experiments do not
at all agree with those of Mr. Isherwood ; and although made
on a smaller scale, the author believes that if the influence of
temperature had been nearly as great as that stated by Mr.
Isherwood, it could not possibly have escaped detection. Mi
nute errors in measuring the head or the size of the orifice
would sensibly affect the values of the coefficients obtained ; and
these may possibly be wrong to the extent of 2 or 3 per cent. ;
but these errors would not affect the relative values of the
coefficients in any sensible degree, and the author therefore

286              Prof. W. C. Unwin on             the   Discluirge    of Water
believes that temperature has a far less influence    on the dis
charge  from  simple  orifices than Mr. Isherwood's results would
imply. It is difficult to explain to what the higher results
obtained by Mr. Isherwood are duo ; but the conjecture may be
hazarded that the orifice in his experiments was very excep
tionally placed.    It was at the end of a bell-mouthed tube
some 10 inches long, a great part of which was only
diameter ; and there was a plug-cock immediately above the
                                                             inch                       J
orifice. It seems possible that there was a good deal of fric
tion in this pipe, and that the diminution of friction in this
part of the apparatus led to the increase of discharge as the
temperature increased *.
   Thus far the effect of the temperature on the capacity of
the reservoir and the size of the orifice has been neglected.
It only remains to examine whether the expansion of these
has any material influence on the results.
   The effect of temperature on the quantities entering into the
                                                                       D2      .

because the mouthpiece was of brass and the reservoir of cast
iron ; and the former expands more than the latter. Secondly,
the level marks being attached to the side of the cistern, the
distance between these marks and the centre of the orifice in
creases as the temperature rises.    There     however, an un   is,
certainty  in  applying    correctiona for the expansion of the
metal, because, its external surface being exposed to the air,
its mean temperature would be less than the temperature of
the water.    The following estimate of the correction   there                     is
fore approximate only.
   Let     et be the         expansion of brass per unit of length and per

of the tube to which, in Mr. Isnerwood's experiments, tho orifices were
attached.    Taking   inches length of pipe

and putting the data in feet —        :

Then, in consequence    of the expansion of the metal, the ratio
of the areas -s becomes
and the true difference   of the square roots of the heads is
The formula of flow, allowing for the alteration of the dimen
sions by rise of temperature, is therefore
   Let «„= -000006,
        ^=-00001,
        T= 190°- 60°= 130;
Hence it is obvious that the effect of the expansion of the
reservoir and orifice is very small for the range of temperature

in these experiments. Allowing for that expansion, we get
for the experiments at 190°,

or slightly smaller values of the coefficient than those given
above.
   It is rather curious that it is stated in Mr. Isherwood's paper
that the results are corrected for the variation of the size of
the orifice as the temperature varied, but no mention is made
of a correction for the size of the reservoir or the expansion of
the vessel to which the index-marks denoting the initial and
final heads were attached.       If  these latter corrections have
been omitted, though this is difficult to believe, Mr. Isher
wood's results should be divided by
where ec is the coefficient of expansion of the material of the
reservoir, whatever that was.       This would sensibly diminish
the apparent increase of discharge at high temperatures given
in his experiments.

 XXXIX.      Action of Alkaline Solution of Permanganate          0,
    Potash on certain Gases.        By   J. A. WANKLYN and W.

                  alkaline solution of permanganate of potash,   we
have made experiments on the common gases, and have arrived
 at results of some interest.     The solution which we have em
ployed in these experiments contained 16 grms. of permanga
nate of potash ana 5 grms. of caustic potash dissolved in a
litre of distilled water.
                      Binoxide of Nitrogen, NO.
    This gas was prepared in the usual manner by the action of
diluted nitric acid on metallic copper. On submitting it to
the above-described solution of alkaline permanganate there
was immediate action, the gas being instantly absorbed at
ordinary temperatures, and the solution being instantly deco
lorized and caused to deposit the brown hydrated binoxide of
manganese.
    110 cubic centims.     of NO and 30 cubic centims. of the
potash-and-permanganate solution were shaken up together.
Immediately the solution lost its colour and deposited the
brown binoxide of manganese, and 85 cubic centims. of the
gas was absorbed.
    The reaction is
                   NO + KMn04 = Mn02 + KN03.
                     Protoxide of Nitrogen, N20.
    This gas, prepared in the usual way from nitrate of ammonia,
appears to be quite without action on the alkaline solution of
permanganate of potash.         Even on prolonged heating of the
materials in the water-bath there was no sign whatever of
action, the permanganate preserving its brilliancy, and the
volume of the enclosed gas undergoing no diminution.
                            Nitrogen Gas.
    Experiments published some years ago by one of us show
that this gas is not attacked by the alkaline solution of per
manganate, even when the temperature is considerably raised.
                         Carbonic Oxide, CO.

the case of the binoxide of nitrogen, but is comparatively slow.
    118 cubic centims. of CO and 30 cubic centims. of the
above solution of potash and permanganate of potash were
scaled up and heated in the water-bath, being frequently
taken out of the bath, cooled, and shaken.       Altogether the
heating occupied some three or four hours. On opening the
tube under water it was found that great absorption of ga§
had taken place.

regard being had to the amount of KMnO4 which had been
reduced during the operation. At ordinary temperatures the
action takes place, but very slowly.
                                     Hydrogen
is also absorbedby the alkaline solution of permanganate. In
an experiment in which 64 cubic centims. of hydrogen were
sealed up with 16 cubic centims. of alkaline permanganate and
heated for some hours in the water-bath, an absorption of 34
cubic centims. of hydrogen was noted.
   We are continuing the investigation.

 cylinder in such manner that one of the electrodes is in con
 tact with it in the vicinity of the poles of the magnet, and the
 second electrode at a point situated between the two poles,
experience shows that the cylinder begins to rotate about the
magnet. The direction of rotation depends on that of the
 current in the cylinder, and also on the situation of the poles.
As to the magnet itself, it remains perfectly motionless ; con
sequently the galvanic current does not exert upon it any ro
tatory action. It is therefore possible to turn the magnet
mechanically round its axis without the slightest obstacle being
offered by the reciprocal action of the magnet and current ;
the sole resistance to be surmounted in the mechanical rotation
of the magnet is occasioned by the friction in the sockets of
the axis, &c., a resistance which has nothing to do with the
current.       In a previous memoir*         I  have demonstrated that,
according      to  the  mechanical    theory  of heat, every phenomenon
of the sort mentioned will be accompanied by a phenomenon
of unipolar induction.           In fact, if the pile be removed and
replaced by a galvanometer inserted between the two above-
mentioned electrodes, and in contact with the cylinder, the
galvanometer indicates the rise of a current as soon as the cy
linder is mechanically put in rotation.                 The electromotive
force here consists of the mechanical work necessary to over
come the reaction of the magnet upon the current in that part
of the circuit which is set rotating. This species of induction
has received the name of " unipolar induction."                 The current
produced is proportional to the velocity of the cylinder.                Of
course the simultaneous mechanical rotation of the magnet
produces no augmentation in the current generated by the
rotation of the cylinder, since this augmentation would be
made without the consumption of a corresponding amount of
mechanical work — which would be perfectly absurd. Pliicker
has also proved by experiment that in this case the rotation of
the magnet is incapable of producing a current.                 Here is an
other .reason : — It has been demonstrated by experiment that,
in the case in question, for the magnet a solenoid can be sub
stituted, producing the same effectf.               I have myself shown,
on a previous occasionJ, that the rotation of the solenoid about
its axis cannot produce a unipolar induction current, whether
proceeding from a single fluid or from two fluids in transla-
tory motion.         It is therefore, in this case, the rotation of the
cylinder about the magnet that gives rise to the observed uni-

sicists have assumed.           If the magnet and cylinder be connected
together so      as  to  form    a  compact body, the magnet is carried
in the direction of the rotation of the cylinder without any
modification in the induction of the magnet resulting, as we
have seen.        The magnet acts in this case on the cylinder as if
the former were immovable and the latter alone rotating. The
-opinion expressed by several physicists, that the magnet can
not produce unipolar induction in a conductor with which it is
intimately united, is therefore not correct.            If the radius of
the cylinder be sufficiently reduced for the cylinder to be in
 perfect contact with the magnet, this circumstance will not
prevent induction taking place in the cylinder ; and since in
duction will be produced perfectly irrespective of the thickness
of the cylinder, the latter can be entirely removed and the
electrodes of the galvanometer put into immediate contact with
the magnet without causing the induction to cease.                    The
magnet itself       then    performs   me  functions of a conductor, and
 the induction does not result from its being put in rotation as
a magnet, but from its rotation as a conductor.             We are here
 in presence of the phenomenon of unipolar induction first pro
 duced by W. Weber*.
     If now we are asked how it is that a current is possible in
 this case, we can reply that this must necessarily take place if
 our idea of the nature of the galvanic current is correct —
 namely, that it consists in the translatory motion of a fluid
 going in the positive directionf, or of two fluids following op
 posite directions.         To understand the necessity of the produc
 tion of  a  current     in   the case in question, one can adopt either
 of the above-mentioned opinions. In the memoir cited (p. 3),
 I  have recalled the known fact that a metal ring surrounding
 a magnet and traversed by a galvanic current transports itself,
 if movable, along the magnet. It stops in the middle, where
 it takes up a position of stable equilibrium if its galvanic cur
 rent follows the same direction as the molecular currents of
 which we imagine the magnet to be formed. If, on the con
 trary, the current of the ring follows the opposite direction,
 the ring will be in unstable equilibrium at the middle of the
 magnet ; and if removed from that position, it will continue
 moving further from the centre until it passes beyond the
 poles of the magnet.             This motion of the ring is determined
 by the law which regulates the action of a magnetic pole upon

an element of current, which law, as is known, is formulated
as follows : — A single magnetic pole acts on a current-element
ds with a force directly proportional to the product of the
magnetic moment M of the pole, the intensity i of the current,
and the sine of the angle         \
                             between the currcnt-element and
the straight line joining the pole of the magnet to the same
clement, and inversely proportional to the square of the dis
tance   r   between these last.       The force in question may there
fore be expressed by          -5        .   The point of application   of
the force is situated in the current-element ; and its direction
is perpendicular to the plane which passes through the mag
netic pole and the current-element.       The sense in which the
force -acts upon the said direction depends, moreover, on the
direction of the current and the nature of the pole.
   When the cylinder is put in rotation about the fixed mag
net, the electric fluid or the two fluids (if we admit two) put
themselves in rotation in the same direction.      They form, then,
currents with a horizontal circulation round the vertical mag
net ; and their intensity will be proportional to the velocity of
the rotation.
   The sole difference between these currents and ordinary
galvanic currents      is,
                         that the two fluids (if they are two in
number)    follow  the  same  direction, while in ordinary galvanic
currents they take opposite directions.       But, according to the
usual ideas, the action of the magnet upon the negative cur
rent  isthe same as its action upon       positive current going in
                                            a
the opposite direction.      Now the poles of the magnet act, in
virtue of the law above cited, upon the currents produced by
the rotation of the cylinder      and the consequence of this will
                                  ;
be that the cylinder will receive an excess of aether (electro
positive fluid) at its two extremities, and deficiency of aether
                                                  a
(electronegative fluid) in the centre, or vice versa, according
to the direction of the rotation and the position         of
                                                          the poles.
In a conducting wire, one of the extremities of which             in
                                                                  is
contact with the centre, and the other with one of the edges
of the cylinder, there will necessarily arise galvanic current.
                                                      a
The direction of the current thus produced and the augmen
tation of its intensity with that of the velocity of rotation are
perfectly like what takes place in experiment.
   In opposition to this view the following objection may now
be raised: —     If
                 the rise of the unipolar induced current depends
on the electric molecules commencing to move round the
magnet at the same time as the conductor in which they are
present,    similar induced current should also arise
            a                                               if,
                                                            the con
ductor and the electric molecules remaining at rest, the mag

net is put in motion round them, seeing that the phenomenon
can only depend on the relative motion between the magnet
and those molecules. If, then, it is proved by the above-
mentioned experiments that the magnet acts on an electric
molecule in rotation about it. it must equally act on the mole
cule if the latter is at rest while the magnet moves round it.
This certainly ought to be the case, and we shall see examples
of it in the sequel.
    Let us imagine the cylinder divided into vertical column?,
each presenting a section equal to unity.     To determine quanti
tatively the force of induction produced in the cylinder by
the magnet, it will be sufficient to take one of the columns
into consideration.       Let us represent the magnet by ab
(Plate   VIII.  fig. 1), and name one of the columns dc, the dis
tance of which from the magnet shall be indicated by r. Let
« designate the south pole, and n the north pole, and 21 the
distance from the one to the other. Suppose that the cylinder,
viewed from above, revolves round the magnet in the opposite
direction to that of the hands of a watch. The excess of aether
(electropositive fluid) will then collect at the extremities of the
column, and the deficiency will make itself sensible in the
centre.    If the angular velocity be designated by v, the velo
city of the column will be equal to rv. The intensity of a
current can be expressed by qav, in which q denotes a constant,
a the section of the conductor, and v the velocity of the elec
tric fluid. The intensity of the current produced by the rota
 tion in any element dz can then be designated by grvdz, in
which q is a constant, and rv, as we have seen, the velocity of
the. before-mentioned element.      If straight lines be drawn from
the two poles to the element ds situated in k at the distance z
from the line fe, and if kg and kh are perpendicular to the lines
mentioned, the south pole will drive the aether (electropositive
fluid) along kg, while the north pole will lead it along kh.
 Designating by M the intensity of the magnetic poles, the
first force will be represented by

   Supposing the length of the cylinder equal to the distance
between the poles of the magnet, or 21, by integration we shall
obtain the force conducting the electric fluid of the cylinder
to its extremities, namely

This last expression constitutes the electromotive force pro
duced.
   We will now see if this expression of the electromotive force
conforms to the exigences of the mechanical theory of heat.
If a current equal to unity be made to pass through the column
from fiod, the column begins to rotate in the opposite direc
tion to that in which we considered it to move by the action
of the external mechanical force. From the law previously
given, it is easy to calculate the force with which the mag
net acts upon the current.     The squares of the distances of the
two poles from the element dz, situated at the distance z from
the line /«, are (l — zf + r* and (l + z)2 + r2 ; and sin X is equal,
in the two cases, to                  =- and  -            , respec-
tively.   The force with which the magnet acts upon the cur
rent in the direction normal to the plane containing the poles
of the magnet and the element dz is therefore

It has been demonstrated in my memoir* that, according to
the mechanical theory of heat, the electromotive force of in
duction resulting from the rotation of the cylinder with a
velocity w^=rv will be equal to a constant (the value of which
depends on the unit chosen to designate the intensity of the
current) multiplied by the product of the expression (B) and
rv. In fact, by multiplying rv into that expression we find
again the previously given expression (A).
                                                     If
   We obtain, then, the following result : — it bo admitted
that, in the case in question, unipolar induction is produced
by the action of the magnet on the currents due to the electric
molecules being carried along in the direction of the rotation
of the cylinder, we shall get for the electromotive force an ex-

pression conformable to the requirements of the mechanical
theory of heat.
    We will now treat another case of induction.                 sn (fig. 2)
represents    a powerful     magnet,    the   south  pole  of which  is in «,
and the north pole        in  n  ;  and  abed   is a  circular metal   plate
haying its centre in the prolongation of the geometrical axis
of the magnet, and its plane perpendicular to the same axis.
If   the plate be set in rotation about the axis so, the electric
fluid will be carried in the direction of the rotation, and the
velocity of an electric molecule will be proportional to its dis
tance from the centre o.            Now let us imagine a plane con
taining    the  axis   of  the     magnet    and an electric element dz
situated   in  m, at  the   distance   r  from   the centre of the plate.
Then let the right lines mq and mt be drawn in this plane,
 respectively perpendicular to the lines sm and nm. The line
mq is then perpendicular to the plane which passes through
the south pole and the tangent of the orbit of the element dz ;
 and the line mt is perpendicular to the plane passing through
 the same tangent and the north pole.              The plate being in ro
 tation in the direction indicated by the arrows, the electric
 element is urged by the south pole towards q, and by the north
 pole towards t. Let l be the distance between the poles, p the
 distance from the north pole to the centre of the plate, r the
 distance from this last to the point TO, and M the force of the
 poles ; further, let A; be a constant, and v the velocity of rota
 tion of the plate : the force with which the element dz is urged
 by the south pole towards the periphery of the plate (or, which
 comes to the same, the component of the action of the same
 pole upon dz along the plane of the plate) will be given by
                              kMvr(l+p)dz
 and the force with which the north pole tends to direct the
  same element towards its centre will be expressed by
                                kMvrpds
                               (p> + *?)*'
      By equating    these two expressions we shall obtain the value
  of r for which the two forces make equilibrium.               We get this
  value from the equation
  The circle whose radius has this value may be called the neuter
  circle.   If, for example, we take 1=10 and p = b centims., we
  get r=12'7 centims. The electric molecules situated between
  the neuter circle and the periphery of the plate are directed by

   296           Prof. E. Edlund on Unipolar Induction.
   the magnetic force towards that periphery ; and those which
   lie between that circle and the centre are driven towards the
   latter. As the formula shows, the value of r of the neater
   circle increases with l and p.         If  the plate be touched outside
   of the neuter circle with the ends of the electrodes of a galva
   nometer, the galvanometer indicates a current which goes from
   the point of contact situated nearest the periphery, through
   the galvanometer, to the other point of contact.                  If, on the
   contrary,   both  points   of  contact    lie between      the neuter   circle
   and the centre of the plate, the current passes from the point
   of contact situated nearest the centre, through the galvano
   meter, to the other point of contact.            If  the neuter circle lies
   between the two points of contact, the positions of these latter
   can be selected so as to give rise to no current.               If  the plate
   moves ih the reverse direction, the electric fluid accumulates
   around the neuter circle, and the current consequently changes
   its direction.    These deductions from theory have been verified
   by the observations of M. Felici*.
       Pliicker has experimentally investigated the following
   case : — Through the centre of a metal disk, ab (fig. 3), passes
   an axis, cd, of the same metal, about which the disk can be set
   in rotation. Nearer to the circumference of the disk an aper
   ture is pierced, into which a magnet, sn, is fitted so that its
   centre is in the plane of the disk, and its axis parallel to the
   axis of rotation.     If the rotation takes place in the direction
  indicated by the arrow, the poles of the magnet having the
   position shown in the figure, on uniting by a conducting wire
   one of the extremities of the axis of rotation to the circumfe
   rence of the disk we obtain a galvanic current passing from
'
  the former to the latter through the wire.                The current con
  sequently    follows  the  same   direction    as  if  the disk with its axis
  were in rotation about the magnetf.
      According to what precedes, the induction at any point of
  the conductor depends on its motion relatively to the magnet
  regarded as a fixed point.         As is known, this relative motion
   undergoes    no  modification    if to the magnet as well as to the
  point in question equal velocities in the same direction be im
  parted. Thus, in the first place, it is easy to determine the
  induction in the axis of rotation itself by proceeding as fol
  lows : — To the rotation-axis and the magnet a velocity is im
  parted equal but opposite to the actual velocity of the magnet,
  which therefore comes to rest, while the axis rotates about it
  in the direction indicated by the arrow. The induction in tho
  axia consequently becomes the same as if tho magnet were at

rest and the axis were revolving round it with the same an
gular velocity. As regards the induction in the metallic disk,
it can be determined in the following manner : —
   Let a (fig. 4) be the point of the disk in which the axis
is fixed, m that in which the disk is traversed by the magnet,
and p the distance between these points. The rotation- velocity
may then be expressed by pv, v denoting the angular velocity,
and this being effected in the direction from in to b. Any
point, q, of the disk, at the distance r from the axis, will then
move with the rotation-velocity rv in the direction qs.        In
order to determine the induction at the point q, we now give
to the magnet and to the point q the velocity pv, but in a di
rection opposite to that previously impressed on the magnet.
This comes to rest, and the point q receives a velocity equal in
quantity and direction to the resultant of the two velocitiespu
and rv, represented in the figure by the lines qt and qs. The
angle qsw being equal to the angle a, the value of that resultant
will be
                         v >/ r1 +p2 — 2rp cos «.
Now   -Jr+p* — 2rpcosa       denotes the distance at which q lies
from m, the point at which the magnet is fixed in the disk.
Consequently the point q receives the same velocity as if it
moved round the faxed magnet.         As this applies to any point
whatever, it follows that the induction produced in the disk
during its motion round the axis will be the same as if the
disk moved round the magnet with the same velocity of rota
tion.
   The following case of induction permits the intensity of the
induced current to be compared with the result obtained by
calculation : — In fig. 5, sm represents a magnet having its
south pole in a and its north pole in m. At the centre of the
magnet and near the south pole are two brass bars of equal
length, ab and cd, fixed perpendicular to the axis of the mag
net. The bar ab is insulated from the magnet, and furnished
at its lower side with a cylinder which is soldered to     it, sur
rounding   the magnet   without  being  in contact with  it. Upon
this cylinder slides    metal spring connected to the galvano
meter by the wire    it I. a
                         The other bar, cd,     in metallic contact
                                                    is
with the magnet  ;     carries at its upper extremity a mercury-
cnp, into which dips the second wire,        coming from the gal

vanometer.
   The two brass bars are joined together by the cylinders ac
and bd of the same metal. These cylinders can be placed at
different distances from the magnet, either one on each side
or both on the same side of it.      If this apparatus be put in

298          ,Prof. E. Edlund on Unipolar Induction.
rotation abont the axis of the magnet so that, viewed from
above, it moves in the opposite direction to the hands of a
watch, an induced current is obtained passing from the mer
 cury-cup, through the galvanometer, to the spring that slides
 upon the metal cylinder.      We will now calculate the intensity
of this induced current.
   An electric element dr, situated in t, at the distance r from
the magnet, has a velocity which may be designated by ro if
 v signifies the angular velocity.     Upon this element the two
poles  exert  equal  actions,  the one  along the right line tu, the
other along tic. Taking      the component of these forces in the
direction ab, we shall get (21 signifying the distance between
the poles, M the magnetic moment of the poles, and k a con
stant)
   Integrating this expression      between the limits r=0 and
r=r0 (this last denoting    the distance between the magnet and
the cylinder ac), we get, for the total electromotive force in
duced in the bar ao,
                                                                 (C)
   The two poles tend to drive in opposite      directions an elec
tric element dz of the bar ac, situated at the distance z from
the point a; but the action of the south pole is the more pow
erful, because that pole is nearer to dz than the other.         The
resultant of their action will be                               •
   Integrating between the limits z=0 and z=l, we get, as
the expression of the total of the electromotive force induced
in the cylinder ac,
                                                                (!  }
   For the calculation of the electromotive force induced in
the bar cs, the north pole will be sufficient to take into consi
deration, since the south pole, acting perpendicularly to the
length of this bar, does not contribute to the transfer of the
electric molecules. It is moreover evident that the electro
motive force induced in cs acts in a direction opposite to
      of the forces induced in ao and ac.           The expression

               Prof. E. Edlund on Unipolar Induction.                 299
of this force will be
                                                                      (E)
    Subtracting the expression (E) from the sum of (C) and
(D), we get, for the total electromotive force of the induced
current,
                                     kMv.
    This force, then, is independent of the distance between the
bar ac and the magnet, just as it is of their lengths. The
theoretic consideration, moreover, evidently requires that the
force be independent of the section of the conductor, and that
it have the same value, whether the brass cylinders ac and bd
are introduced both at the same time into the apparatus, or
only one at a time *. In the former case we have two elec
tromotors ; but they are placed side by side and consequently
do not augment the electromotive force.             The same fact pre
sents itself here as when we connect each to each the po
sitive poles and the negative poles of two ordinary piles : the
electromotive force is not changed ; but the resistance of the
combined pile is lessened by one half. Now the resistance in
the circuit oacs is extremely slight in comparison with that of
the galvanometer ; therefore the intensity of the current will
remain the same, whether the cylinders ac and bd be both in
troduced into the apparatus or only one of them, and the dis
 tance at which they happen to be from the magnet will not
influence the result. This is proved by the following experi
 ments, made with an apparatus of this kind : —

    These observations, therefore, have verified the results of
the theory.
  It  is unnecessary to say that the above deflections are cleared
of the feeble thermoelectric currents produced               by
                                                         the heating
of the points of contact during the rotation. It             easy tois
eliminate these currents, seeing that they are independent of
the direction of the rotation.
    After thisI     proceeded to the following experiment —                    :
Two ebonite disks, agbh and ekfm (fig. G), of equal dimen
sions, their peripheries encased in        a  band of brass, were
pierced   in the centre  and passed    over an axis cd, about which
they could be put in rotation.        ab and    represent two brass
                                               ef
rules fixed to the disks and communicating in a and              with      e
the brass bands, while they are insulated from them in            and      b
/and likewise      from  the  axis   cd.  tn   is   magnet passing
                                                    a
 through the two disks without any communication with the
two brass rules.     One of the disks is  placed at the height of the
 south pole, and the other at the centre of the magnet, tu                         is
 a. brass bar communicating with the rules ab and            this bar
                                                                  ef
                                                                  ;
 can be placed at different distances on both sides of the axis.
 The brass springs  p   and q  slide over the brass bands that en
 circle the disks, and thus communicate with the rules ab and
ef  and the bar tu.    These springs are connected with the elec
 trodes of the galvanometer.        The rotation of the apparatus
about cd, in the direction indicated by the arrow, gives rise to
an electric current which passes from the spring            through q,
the galvanometer, to the other spring.
    During the rotation the poles of the magnet describe circles
about the rotation-axis the radius of which             is
                                                       equal to r0                 ;

              Prof. E. Edlund on Unipolar Induction.                     301
their velocity may therefore be denoted by r0v, if v is the
angular velocity.     The velocity of the bar tu is r-jV, r-^ de
noting  its distance from  the rotation-axis.   The relative velo
city of the bar  with  respect to the magnet regarded as im
movable will therefore be (r0 + r!)», as already remarked above.
If the bar passes through the points x and y on the same side
of the axis of the rotation as the magnet is placed, and at the
distance TI from that axis, the relative velocity of the bar with
respect to the magnet will be (r0— r-^v.        Thus the relative
velocity of the bar will in both cases be the same as if the
magnet were regarded as immovable, and the disks as well as
the bar as in rotation about it with the same angular velocity
as that which they have in reality about the axis cd.         It is
the same with the brass rules ab and             ef.
   This being admitted, let us suppose we make two experi
ments with the same velocity of rotation, but with this dif
ference—that in the one the bar occupies the place indicated
by the figure, while in the other      itplaced in ay. In both
                                            is
cases the induction will be the same as       the apparatus were
                                                  if
in rotation about the magnet at rest.         In the first case we
have to consider the induction in the circuit atue as well as in
the two rings surrounding the disks, and in the second case
the induction in a?ye as well as in the same rings.       Now the
calculation given above has shown that the induction in the
circuit atue    equal to that of the circuit axye.
                 is                                  Therefore,               if
these deductions are correct, the intensity of the induced
current must be the same, whatever the situation of the bar.

   According to the preceding statement, unipolar induction
ought not to be considered a real induction, but an ordinary
electrodynamic phenomenon due to the action of the magnet
upon the electric currents produced by the motion of the
conductor relatively to it.  As for the action of the magnet,
whether the currents on which       acts are produced by spe

 302          Prof. E. Edlund on Unipolar Induction.
 cial electromotive forces, or by the electric fluid being carried
 along in the direction of motion of the conductor, is quite
 immaterial.     If we notwithstanding continue to regard the
 unipolar phenomena as belonging to those of induction, we
 shall be obliged to distinguish        the following species of
 magnetic   induction  : —
    1. Induction due to the action of the magnet upon the
 induced circuit augmenting or diminishing, or in general un
 dergoing a variation.     This may take place in the two follow
 ing ways   :
    (a) The magnetic moment undergoes a change, while the
 induced circuit and the magnet remain at rest, and conse
 quently do not alter their relative position ;
    (b) The magnet and the induced circuit approach towards
 or recede from each other without the magnetic moment under
 going variation.
    2. Induction due to the circumstance that the conductor
 moves in regard to the magnet without the distance from the
 poles of the latter to the different points of the conductor ne
 cessarily varying, and without augmentation or diminution of
 the magnetic moment — unipolar induction.
    These different species of induction may of course some
 times present themselves in combination, as the following ex
 ample shows.      Let *?i (fig. 7) be a magnet, and ab a metal
 tube the axis of which coincides with the prolongation of the
 axis of the magnet.     If  we increase, or if we diminish the
magnetic moment, there will arise in the tube induced cur
rents of the species la.      If we move the brass tube towards
or away from the magnet without modifying the magnetic
moment, induced currents will result of the species 16, but
also at the same time those of the species 2.    On removing the
tube away from or approaching it to the magnet, the electric
molecules present in the tube are carried in the direction of
the movement, and thus form true electric currents, upon which
the magnet acts according to the known law of action between
a magnet and an electric current.          It is easy to perceive
that these two kinds of currents proceed in the same direction;
but those of species 2 are so feeble in comparison with the
others, that they can hardly be observed at the same time with
them. In the last place, if the tube is put in rotation about
its axis, induced currents exclusively of species 2 tend to be
formed ; and they become appreciable if the two ends of the
tube be connected with the electrodes of a galvanometer.
    By making the theory which has just been expounded serve
for the explanation of the known cases of unipolar induction,
any one may convince himself that it gives for every case re

              Prof. E. Bdlund on Unipolar Induction.                 303
suits accordant with the experiment.            The principle on which
it rests, that the magnet acts upon the electric currents due to
the rotation of the conductor with respect to the magnet in
the same way as upon ordinary currents, this principle cannot,
as far as   I can see, give occasion for any doubt.             The only
objection which it would be possible to make to it would be
that, the velocity we are able to impart to the conductor being
relatively slight, these currents become so feeble that the
action of the magnet upon them is in reality inappreciable.
But to this remark it may be replied that the velocity of the
electric molecules in an ordinary galvanic current has never
been measured ; several physicists have assumed, upon good
grounds, that this velocity is in reality not very great ; it is
therefore not improbable that the velocity which it is possible
 to impart mechanically to a conductor is comparable to that
of the electric molecules in a galvanic current of average in
 tensity.     We must here carefully distinguish between the
 velocity with which the electric movement is propagated from
 place to place and that with which the molecules themselves
 move.     These two velocities have no relation with each other;
 thus, as experiment shows, the former velocity may be ex
 tremely great, although the latter be insignificant *.
     As the electric molecules are carried along in the direction
 in which the conductor is moved, it might perhaps seem, pre
 vious to mature reflection, that a cylindrical tube set in rota
 tion about its axis must exert an electrodynamic action in the
 same manner as a coil through which a galvanic current passes.
  Such an inference, however, is any thing but justified.           If we
 admit two electric fluids, one positive and one negative, it will
                                                                          '
 be noticed that both fluids are conveyed with the same velocity
 and in the same direction during the movement of the con
 ductor ; therefore these curents mutually destroy their reci
  procal effects.    Even if it be admitted that the electric phe
 nomena proceed from one fluid only, the above conclusion is
  premature.      But to prove this it is necessary to revert to the
  principles of the theory as previously explained by me f.
     The phenomena of optics have led to the assumption that
  the a3ther is attracted by ponderable matter.         A material body
 condenses the aether between its molecules until the attraction
  exerted upon an aether molecule situated within the body by
  the molecules of the body becomes equal to the repulsion ex
 erted by the already condensed aether upon the same aether
  molecule. When this point is reached the material body is no
  longer in a position to put in motion the external molecule of
 aether.    Besides that quantity of aether which may be regarded

as connected with the body's own molecules, there exists free
aether between those molecules ; and the quantity of free aether
contained by the entire body must be equal to the quantity of
aether contained in a volume of vacuous space equal to that
of the body. This is what takes place as long as the body is
at rest.   If, on the contrary, the body is put in motion with
the aether which it contains, not only the repulsion of that
aether, but also the attraction of the molecules belonging to
the body upon an exterior aether molecule at rest is modified,
and that in virtue of the established principle that " every
thing that takes place or is effected in nature requires a certain
time." But, as        I
                      have already pointed out, it does not at all
follow from this principle that the modification which the at
traction between the material molecules and the exterior aether
molecule undergoes in consequence of the motion must be
equal to the modification of the repulsion between the aether
molecules contained in the body and the same exterior molecule.
                      I
On the contrary, have positively expressed the opinion * that
the action between different kinds of molecules is also different
 in this respect.    Let us now suppose that d (fig. 8) represents
 an element of a circuit containing the quantity m of free aether
and a quantity m0 of condensed aether, and that this element,
 with the aether contained in        moves with the velocity

the development of electricity by friction.    In this phenome
non the aether molecules pass from the rubber to the body
rubbed, or vice versa.  This passage of the molecules from one
side to the other can hardly have its cause except in the fact
that the repulsion exerted upon them by the body in motion
has been modified in some way by the motion itself.         Now
the action of the moving body upon an aether molecule present
in the motionless rubber     given by the sum of the three ex

same value           for the repulsion as before the body was put in
motion.            Therefore, in order that friction may be capable of
producing electricity, — and                           -£-   cannot have precisely the same

      M. Lemstrom, however, has succeeded in showing, in a
 series of very remarkable experiments, that a rotating cylin
 der is capable of producing a real although excessively feeble
 electrodynamic action.           On putting a pasteboard cylinder
 filled with air in rapid motion round a cylinder of soft iron, be
 found that the magnetic condition of the latter was modified
 by the rotation. M. Lemstrom has demonstrated that the mo
dification can hardly be attributed to any other cause than the
 electrodynamic action of the pasteboard cylinder.                 He intends
 to continue these researches so interesting              and  important, es
pecially from the theoretic point of view.
      As is sufficiently apparent from the preceding considera
 tions, the theory above formulated for the phenomenena of
 unipolar induction does not rest upon vague and arbitrary
assumptions respecting the properties of the magnet and the
galvanic current.          Quite the contrary ; it is based exclusively
on their known properties, discovered by means of experiments
or of investigations of another kind.                The theory is indepen
dent of the admission of one or two electric fluids, and
gives results in complete accordance with experience and with
the requirements of the mechanical theory of heat.                         We
therefore believe we am affirm           that   it  furnishes   the  only ad
missible and true explanation of the phenomena of unipolar
induction, which, as we shall see in the following section,
play a most important part in nature.

Elements      of Dynamic ; an Introduction to the Study of Motion and
    Rest   in Solid and Fluid B°dies. By W. K. CLIFFORD, F.RJS.,
     late Fellow and Assistant Tutor of Trinity College, Cambridge ;
     Professor of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics at University
     College, London.     Part I. Kinematic.         London : Macmillan and
     Co. 1878. (Crown 8vo, pp. 221).
rPHI8 is the first part of a work the completion of which will be
 -*-     looked forward to with great interest by all students of Ma
thematical Physics. Its scope is sufficiently described by its name :
it is a treatise on Kinematics.        Change of motion as it occurs in
nature is due to the mutual action of bodies on each other.               It is,
however, possible to study and describe the motion of a system
without taking into account the conditions that arise from these
mutual actions.        The theory of motion when thus treated is Kine-
&„
    = &.    In this way the same result is arrived at as by assuming that tbe
                                                m ' m°
ratio between these constants is equal to                but its deduction be-

mattes ; or, in the words of the author " the science which teaches
how to describe motion accurately, and how to compound different
motions together, is called Kitiematie (K-JKIJ^U, motion)'" (p. 2).
The existence of a distinction between Kinematics and Dynamics
was recognized long ago, perhaps in the first instance by Ampere* ;
but up to the present time it has only been obtaining recognition
gradually in the Mechanical Treatises most commonly in use. The
 Kinematieal part of Applied Mechanics, it is true, received separate
and systematic treatment long ago in Professor Willis's ' Elements
of Mechanism ; ' and in Professor Bankine's ' Applied Mechanics '
there is a separate Part (III.) on the " principles of Cinematics, or
the comparison of Motions," in addition to a Part (IV.) on the
" theory of Mechanism."       But long after the publication of the
former of these works the distinction was simply ignored in the
text-books of Theoretical Mechanics commonly in use ; or where
that was hardly possible (as in treating the motion of a rigid body
about a fixed point), a few kinematical propositions were introduced
under some such heading as " the Geometrical Nature of a Body's
Motion about a Fixed Point," or " the Geometry of the Motion of a
Rigid Body," &c. In fact the distinction was not worked out com
pletely until the appearance of the first (and hitherto the alone
                                                 '
published) volume of Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy.'
   When a subject consists of two distinct branches, that alone is a
sufficient reason for their separate treatment; but if a further reason
for the separation were needed, it would be found in the fact that,
in consequence of the customary indirect treatment of Kinematics,
parts of it seem to escape the attention of students. Thus, though in
the course of their Dynamical studies most students obtain indi
rectly an acquaintance with the geometry of translatory and rota
tional motion, comparatively few (as we have reason to believe)
have any acquaintance with the geometry of strains.
   The work before us will doubtless confirm the existing tendency
towards a separate study of the theory of pure motion; but this
may be regarded as one of its least merits.         The most marked pe
culiarity of the volume is the unusual form in which even the most
elementary parts of the subject are set forth. To all appearance
the author has established for himself a peculiar point of view from
which to regard the whole subject of Dynamics ; and consequently
his exposition of the kinematical part follows lines quite wide of tho
beaten tracks.     This does not indeed appear at first sight ; for he
treats it under its most obvious subdivisions of Translations, Rota
tions, and Strains ; but when the details of any one of these sub
divisions are examined the originality of the treatment becomes at
once apparent.      For example, the second chapter of the first book
is headed "Velocities," and occupies nearly a fourth part of the
volume.     Although it treats in great part of matters familiar to
every student of Mathematics, the form in which they appear is
very unlike that in which they are commonly treated, and is appa
rently the author's own : «. #., instead of introducing the reader

 directly to such a function as «', our author prefers to start with
 the definition " that a point is said to have logarithmic motion on a
 straight line when its distance from a fixed point on the line is
                                    "
 equally multiplied in equal times (p. 78) ; and then, from the discus
 sion that follows, the function et, as it were, emerges. It is needless
 to add that it is most instructive to see how familiar matters are
 regarded by a mind of great acuteness. Other instances might be
 given, such as the articles headed
                                       " Exact Definition of Tangent,"
 which leads up to another, entitled " Exact Definition of Velocity."
 However instructive many of these discussions may be, it is never
 theless somewhat difficult to account for the presence of many
 things in the volume.    For instance, it is hard to see why a trea
 tise on Kinematics should contain a demonstration of the fact that
 the flux of a function of functions is given by the formula
 and the more as the demonstration is hardly perfect.    "What Pro
 fessor Clifford says is this: — u denoting f(x, y), where x and y
 are functions of t, we find
"and when we strike out common factors and omit suffixes in this
last expression, it becomes a-d,/+i/dy/, where            /
                                                 has been shortly
written instead of^-r, y). Or, substituting u for/, we have" the
above formula (p. 66).   We will not urge that the reader might
easily misunderstand the direction to strike out common factors on
the right-hand side of the equation.      But we would ask how, in the
case of any function not purely algebraical, does the student know
that there is a common factor to be struck out of the numerator
and denominator of any one of the four fractions concerned ? The
fact is, that in all but a few cases the calculation in question can
hardly be performed except by the use of limits or infinitesimals.
   The point which has given rise to these remarks by no means stands
alone.    We find in different parts of the volume : — accounts of
the elementary properties of quadric curves (pp. 27-31, 38, 39, 91)
and surfaces (pp. 172-176, 177-181); the method of finding the
fluxion of tn (p. 55), of finding the area of a parabola (p. 73), of
establishing the relation   I   <*i&=<*+1   :   fc+1   (p. 73), and of pro

the question, For what class of readers is the book designed ? The

      Looking at this well-known relation when thus written, we are
strongly tempted to suspect that in matters of notation there is a good
•leal of mere fashion or arbitrary preference. Mr. Clifford's way of writing
the formula combines two modes of notation, both of which, a few years
ago, would have been considered to have had their day.        Thereis,how
ever, a  reason why the fluxional notation should not be altogether lost
sight of.

The Moon, her Motions, Aspect, Scenery, and Physical Condition.

evidence of an increasing interest in Selenographical inquiries.
The Moon's distance, size, and motions, which Mr. Proctor treats
of in his opening Chapters, have long claimed the attention of astro
nomers ;   and of all the triumphs yet achieved, the Lunar Theory
stands preeminent.      It of late years that many astronomers have
                              is
exhibited no little interest in examining the external characteristics
of members of the Solar System, seeking from them to obtain some
indications of their physical condition   and those who are interested
                                                 ;
in our Satellite are turning their attention especially to the external
configuration of her globe, with      view, first, to ascertain

changes occur among the numerous objects diversifying her sur
face, and, secondly, from the observations obtained to endeavour to
derive some idea of the forces operating in her interior. To this
part of his general subject our author has devoted two chapters —
one on the study of the Moon's surface, the other on its condition.
These chapters will be read with interest by every student seeking
information on the rise, progress, and present state of Selenography.
In many respects this edition an improvement on the first and
                                      is                                           ;

ditions of the Meux's-Well Deposits."         By Charles Moore, Esq.,
F.G.8.
     The author remarks that the Tarious deep-well borings around
 London have abundantly proved the correctness of Mr. Godwin-
 Austen's inference that tie Palaeozoic axis of the Mendips is con
 tinued beneath the Secondary rocks of the south-eastern counties.
 Mr. Moore has himself shown that where these Palaeozoic rocks
 finally disappear under the Secondary strata, there are found at the
 unconformable junction of the two formations a set of deposits in
 dicating the existence of very peculiar physical conditions, and con
 taining an admixture of fossils from very different geological hori
 zons.   Hence he was led to inquire whether any trace of similar
 abnormal deposits might be found in the deep-well borings of
 London.
     With this Tiew he set to work at washing some of the materials
 supplied to him from the Meux's well, and studying the minute and
 often microscopic organisms thus obtained.
     The Chalk was not particularly examined ; but from a single small
 sample of Upper Greensand he obtained numerous Foraminifera and
 Entomostraca, including one Cyprid new to science.
     The Gault yielded 1 (i genera and over 30 species of Foraminifera,
 and 20 species of Entomostraca, 4 of which are new, together with
 many young forms of Gasteropods and Cephalopods.
     But the chief interest of Mr. Moore's investigations centres in the
 C7 feet of strata intervening between the Gault and Devonian.        In
 this marly and oolitic-looking deposit he found no less than 85 dif
 ferent kinds of organisms, exhibiting a singular admixture of marine
 and lacustrine forms of life. Foramiuifera are rare, but Entomostraca
  and Polyzoa are very abundant. Some genera are found, such as Car-
penteria, Saccammina, Thecidium, and Zellania, of which the range in
 time is greatly extended by these investigations.
     The author fully confirms Mr. Etheridge's reference of the beds
 in question to the Neocomian period, widely as they differ in phy
 sical characters from the Lower Greensand strata of the south-east
 of England.    From a careful study of the nature and condition of
 preservation of the minute organisms he concludes that the deposits
 which contain them were formed at first in shallow lacustrine hollows
 on the surface of the Devonian rocks now lying buried at a depth of
 1000 feet below London, and that these lakes were invaded by the
 waters of the Neocomian sea, with the deposits of which their sedi-
 monte were in part mingled, and under which they were finally buried.

    5. " A Microscopical Study of some Huronian Clay-slates."          By
Dr. Arthur Wichmann.
    Although a considerable amount of attention has been devoted
during recent years to the microscopical study of clay-slates and
slate-clays, yet in none of the published researches on this subject
has any account of the structure of the clay-slates of arehaean age
been given.      The author has availed himself of the extensive series
of Huronian clay-slates collected by Major T. V. Brooks in the
country around Lake Superior to supply this deficiency. The suc
cession and relation of the rocks described have been fully treated
of in the work of Hermann Crcdner and the publications of the
Geological Survey of Michigan.
    The chief object of the author is to discuss the origin of the crys
talline constituents in clay-slates, and at the outset he describes in
detail the microscopical character of clay-slate, of novaculite or
whetstone, and of carbonaceous shales and slates respectively, dwell
ing more especially on the crystallized minerals which can be detected
in each of these rocks, and the nature of the isotropic ground-mass
which sometimes surrounds them. He then points out that three
theories have been advanced to account for the presence of these
crystalline constituents in clay-slates.      According to the first of
these theories, the crystals in question are regarded as the
product of chemical action in the ocean in which the original
material was deposited ; the second theory attributes the formation
of the crystalline minerals to processes of metamorphiam which
have taken place subsequently to the solidification of the rocks ;
the third theory refers them to aggregative action going on in the
still plastic cla3'-slate mud prior to its solidification.    The first of
these   theories  has been maintained by G. R.   Credner  ; but against it
the author adduces numerous arguments, -and especially points out
the difficulty of supposing an ocean capable of depositing from its
waters at successive periods minerals of such different chemical
composition as chlorite, actinolite, &c.     In opposition to the second
theory, which has received the support of Delesse, the author points
out the existence in the rocks in question of broken crystals which
have been recemented by the surrounding clay-slate substance.
The author is thus led to incline towards the third theory, in favour
of which some striking facts, drawn from the microscopical structure
of the rocks, have already been adduced by Zirkel. He admits,
however, that later metamorphic actions arc not to be excluded in
seeking to account for the origin of the crystalline constituents of

312                      Geological Society : —
clay-slates, and points out that four distinct stages must be con
sidered in the series of changes by which the rocks in question have
acquired their present character: — 1st, the deposition of the mud ;
2nd, the formation of minerals during the plastic state ; 3rd, the
separation of materials during solidification ; and 4th, the action of
metamorphic processes.
   6.  " On  a Section through Glazebrook Moss, Lancashire."         By T.
Mellard    Reade, Esq., P.G.S.
   The section described has been exposed in a cutting made by the
Wigan Junction Railway. The moss rests on an almost perfectly
level floor of Boulder-clay, and is at the deepest part about 18 feet
thick.    In the 3 or 4 feet at the base are branches &c. of trees ; and
the stools are found resting on and rooted in the Boulder-clay;
these are of oak or birch.       Prostrate trunks were found, one, an
oak, being   46 feet long  and 3  in diameter.    The surface of the clay
is about 60 feet above    O.D.   The   author  thinks  the section shows
that the   moss originated  from   the decay  of  the forest, favoured by
change of climate, and gradually extended itself from the centre
outwards, trees within it at the outer part being much less dis
coloured than those further in. In the latter part of the paper
some cuttings and borings in the clays and sands are described, and
the asserted occurrence of the trunk of a tree in the Boulder-clay is
noticed.

       " On the Tertiary Deposits    on the Solimoes and Javary Rivers
in Brazil."    By  C. B. Brown,  Esq.    With an Appendix by R. Ethe-
ridge, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S., and communicated by him.
   The author in 1874 had the opportunity of examining some beds
on the Solimoes, or Upper Amazon, and the Javary, one of its
tributaries, containing fresh- and brackish-water shells similar
to those found in Tertiary deposits at Pebas, still higher up the
river.   The author indicates certain errors into which he considers
previous writers to have fallen, and calls attention to the great
extent of these beds, now demonstrated to occupy a tract of country
300 miles in length by 50 miles in breadth, and to the enormous
change in the physical features of the region which must have taken
place since their deposition.     When this took place the sea reached
probably 1500 miles west of its present shore-line, covering the
country which is now the valley of the Amazon.            The absence of
examples of false-bedding in the deposits leads him to the conclusion
that they were formed in comparatively still water, into which
flowed numerous streams bearing much vegetable matter, which has
served for the formation of lignitic deposits, the whole being pro
bably the upper beds of a series deposited under similar conditions
to those of deltas in the present day.    In an appendix, Mr. Etheridge
notices the fossils collected by the author, which included seeds of
Chara, and species of Mytilus (1 new), Anisothyris (4, 1 new),
Lutraria (1), Thracia (1), Anodon (1), Unio (1), Natica ? (1),
Neritina (2 new), Odostomia (1), Hydrobia (1 new), Iscea (1), Dyrit

    8. " On the Physical History of the English Lake-district, with
Notes on the possible Subdivision of the Skiddaw Slates."          By J.
Clifton Ward, Esq., Assoc.K.S.M., F.G.S.
    The author traces the physical history of the lake-district from
the commencement of the period when the Skiddaw slate was
deposited. To this succeeded the volcanic Borrowdale series, which
is followed after a physical break by the Coniston Limestone.
Between this and the succeeding Silurian deposits there is little, if
any, break. Thus, in the Lake-district, the break between Upper
and Lower Silurian is physically below the Conistou Limestone,
though palaeontologically it is above it.
    The Old Red Sandstone period was one of denudation, which was
continued into the Carboniferous period ; and perhaps the whole
district was actually covered by the sea during the maximum
depression of the Lower Carboniferous epoch.          Since then it has
 probably never been submerged, but exposed to continuous subaeriol
 denudation.     The physical significance of the Mell-Fell (Lower
 Carboniferous) conglomerates receives special attention.
    The author then, from consideration of the amount of deposition
 and rate of denudation, attempts to estimate the period which has
 elapsed since the commencement       of the record, and sets it down as
 62,000,000 of years. The author then considers the age of the
 Skiddaw slates. From lithological resemblances he is led to cor
 relate the Skiddaw grit with the basement grit in the Welsh Arenig
 series, and thus to regard the beds below the grit as the equivalent of
 the Tremadoc, and perhaps of part of the Lingula Flogs.
    The palsoontological evidence for the correspondence of the Arenig
 series with the whole of the Skiddaw slates rests chiefly on Graptolites
 and Trilobites. The author holds that the evidence from the former
 is inconclusive, and that from the latter to some extent contradictory,
 so that the physical evidence can in no way be overridden by it.

 North Wales."      By F. Ruddy, Esq. Commuuicated by Prof. T.
 M'K. Hughes, M.A., F.G.S.
     The author describes a series of sections in the upper part of the
 Bala and the succeeding beds, and gives lists of fossils. Details of
 the various beds between the Bala and Hirnant Limestone are
 given, above which come soft blue shales underlying Tarannon
 shales, when fossils cease until the base of the Wenlock is reached.
 The author has been able to trace the Hirnant Limestone and grit
 considerably beyond the limits of the Hirnant valley.       The sections
 at Cynwyd (to the west of Corwen) are described.         Here occur the
 equivalents of the Bala Limestone and beds above this up to the
 level (probably) of the Hirnant Grit.

       A SPECTROMETRIC        STUDY OF SOME SOURCES OF LIGHT.
                                BY A. CROVA.
rPHE       general law of emission of the radiations emitted by a body
 -*-    raised to an elevated temperature is not completely known.
Uulong and Petit * have given the empirical law of the obscure ra
diations emanating from a body heated to temperatures below 240°;
and Edm. Becquerelt has demonstrated that the intensity of the
red, green, and blue radiations varies with the temperature of the
body which emits them, according to an exponential law analogous
to that of Dulong aud Petit.
    The exponentials which represent the law of emission of radia
tions of different refraugibilities are represented by curves of which
the origin corresponds to the temperature at which the radiation
considered commences to be produced, and rises the more rapidly
as the wave-lengths of the radiations become less.           According to
M. Edm. Becquerel, the logarithms of the bases of these exponen
tials vary in the inverse ratio of the wave-lengths of the radiations.
     These considerations may serve as a starting-point to a method
of determination, t'n a spectrometric way, of the temperature of
incandescent solids or liquids.       In fact it follows from the investi
                          J
gations of Mr. Draper aud M. Edm. Becquerel that, when the tem
perature of an incandescent solid increases in a continuous manner,
the spectrum of the radiations emitted by it lengthens towards the
violet end, and that each of the radiations of this spectrum is at the
same time increased in intensity according to an exponential for
mula.      The temperature of the luminous source can therefore be
measured : — (1) by means of the wave-length of the radiation which
limits the spectrum towards the violet ; (2) by the position of the
thermal maximum of the spectrum, which approaches nearer to the
violet in proportion as the emission-temperature becomes higher ;
(3) by means of the ratio of the luminous intensity of a determi
nate radiation A, taken in the spectrum of the source, to the inten
sity of the same radiation in the spectrum of a source of known
temperature, compared with the ratio of the luminous intensities of
another radiation X' in the same two spectra.
    These last determinations can be easily effected by meaus of a
spectrophotometer.        Several observers have made use of instru
ments of this kind §.         I used that of M. Glahn, which permits
measurements to be made upon homogeneous radiations.
     On the other hand,    I  have measured the thermal intensity of the
simple radiations of the solar spectrum by means of a linear ther
moelectric pile and a very sensitive galvanometer, using for the

at its surface instead of an achromatic lens. The employment
of a network of lines engraved on the metal instead of the prism
would permit the influence of any elective absorption to be elimi
nated.
    1 have made numerous determinations of thermal curves of the
solar spectrum on exceptionally fine days, at different periods in
 the years 1877 and 1878. These curves differ in the ratio of their
 respective ordinates, but especially in the position of the thermal
 maximum, as has been shown by Melloni.                These curves were ren
 dered comparable with one another by bringing them to the scale of
 the wave-lengths, and reducing, by means of the dispersion-curve of
 the prism, the intensities to those which would correspond to the
 theoretic case of the normal spectrum — that is, of constant dis
 persion.
    The following are, for the luminous part of these spectra, the
 means of a number of concordant observations made under excel

  to the intensity of the same radiation in the solar spectrum, repre
  senting these latter by the value of their thermal intensities, and
  always representing by 1000 the intensity corresponding to the

fcrary case,    rays of the same wave-length, taken from different
spectra, may have notably different properties.
   We can, however, already state that, the intensity being the
same in the red for the four spectra, the weakening towards the
violet varies with each source, according to a certain function of
the temperature ; and without being able yet to attempt a measure
ment of this, we can already arrange them in the order of increasing
temperatures : — moderator lamp ; stearine candle ; illuminating-
gas, of which     I   have not given the less-accordant Tables ; Drum-
mond light ; electric light, and, lastly, the solar light, which cor
responds to an emission-temperature much higher than that of the
electric light, in spite of the uncertainty caused by the absorptions
it has undergone from its transmission through the gaseous en
velopes of the sun and our atmosphere.
   It will be possible to make rigorously exact measurement of the
temperatures in the spectrometric way as soon as we know the
precise law of emission for all the radiations and the numerical
constants for each wave-length.             The results contained in this Note
may be regarded as a first essay towards the solution of this im

   ON   THE EXCITATION OF ELECTRICITY BY PRESSURE AND
      FRICTION.          BY H. FRITSCH, OF KONIGSBERG, PRUSSIA.
   1.  It is well known that many crystalline bodies can be power
fully  electrified     by pressure.     This, however, takes place in each
case only under a perfectly definite condition.               Calc-spar becomes
electric only    when     pressed against      another   substance,   never when
pressed against     another     piece  of   calc-spar.    Three   pieces of calc-
spar were    laid  one    upon  another   ;  a pressure   was  then  exerted upon
the uppermost,      which     would   have   made   each  of the pieces singly di
stinctly electric    :  the  central   piece proved      to  be  quite devoid of
excitation ; only      the  two  outer   ones    possessed   the  usual quantity
of electricity.     If   two  calc-spars    were  pressed against one another,
the surfaces      which     were   in  contact    with the foreign bodies by
which the pressure was exerted exhibited electricity distinctly ; the
two inner surfaces, where calc-spar had been in contact with calc-
spar, were without excitation.            I  have not yet succeeded in carry
ing out the same experiment with other bodies.
   2. According to previous observations, a definite substance, on
undergoing friction against another, acquires always a certain in
variable electrical excitation independent of the collateral circum
stances, and accordingly the nature of the electricity excited is
constantly the same.          To test the correctness of this position the
following experiments were instituted, in which the collateral
circumstances were varied as much as possible.
   «. With a violin-bow         I  stroked plates of zinc, copper, brass, and

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                  317
four different     glasses so that they vibrated transversally ; they became
only negatively electrified.          If  the same bow was drawn backwards
and forwards lengthwise along the same part of the plate without
producing a tone, it became only positively electric.
    b. Copper plates of 4 and 7 centims. diameter were whipped
with white silk in various ways.                  If the stroke was delivered
 nearly perpendicular        to  the   plate, the  latter became strongly posi
tive ; if it was more nearly grazing, the plate became just as strongly
negative.      Whether the plate was fresh cleaned with hydrochloric
acid, or by longer exposure to the air had become tarnished, made
no difference, nor yet the size of the plate.                Further, by lightly
rubbing    its  entire    rim  (best   with   a  silk  or woollen  cloth in the
form of cone-cover), the plate is always rendered negative; by
hard rubbing with the same silk on the same place, always
positive. Coarse woollen cloth appeared to excite less powerfully.
Zinc gave the same result.
    c. With brass the collateral circumstances appeared to have an
influence.      A square plate intended for the production of Chladm's
sound-figures behaved exactly like the copper plate.                The shallow
brass scale of a table-balance, however, gave both electricities only
when struck with silk, and when its surface was well cleaned.
Lastly, an old pound-weight could not be excited in different ways
with silk ; this could only be accomplished with a violin-bow, ac
cording as the bow was applied to its thick main part, or to its
 thin neck.
    d. A small scale- pan of fine silver gave both electricities only
 with silk, with wool it only became negatively electric.
    «. A hard-gum plate always became negative when slowly stroked
 with a tightly folded linen cloth — when stroked quickly, in other
 wise like circumstances, positive. The surface of the hand produced
 the same effect as linen ; only for the positive excitation the stroking
 had to be very rapid.
    /. White silk always makes the principal-cleavage-surface of
 gypsum positive, but the second, which exhibits a vitreous lustre,
 negative ; while it makes no difference whether the surfaces of this
 second cleavage are already present on the piece of gypsum, or are
artificially produced by roughly scraping a surface of the principal
 one.
    Many other substances give opposite electric excitation on friction,
 according to the circumstances — for instance, mica struck with silk,
 hardgum rubbed with copper, hardgum whipped with silk, glass
struck with silk ;      I  have not, however, succeeded in discovering posi
 tive  rules  for  this.    The few experiments cited above (from a to/)
 even   show   the impossibility of constructing a series of intensities
 for frictional electricity.         If two bodies are rubbed against one
 another, the electricity excited in each of them may change into
 the opposite as the pressure, the velocity, or the direction of the
 rubbing motion, &c. varies. — Wiedemann's Annalen, 1878, No. 9.

              THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF JULY 29TH, 1878.
                  BY PROFESSOR HENRY DRAPER, M.D.
    As  I have  recently been giving attention to the subject of solar
spectroscopy in consequence of my discovery of oxygen in the sun,
it seemed to be desirable to take advantage of the total eclipse of
July 20th, to gain as precise an idea as possible of the nature of
the corona, because the study of that envelope has been regarded
as impossible at other times.         The main point to ascertain was
whether the corona was an incandescent gas shining by its own
light, or whether it shone by reflected sunlight.
    For this purpose     I  organized an expedition, and was fortunate
enough    to  secure  the  cooperation  of my friends Professors Barker
and Morton and Mr. Edison.            The scheme of operations was as
follows : — (1) the photographic and photo-spectroscopic work as
 well as the eye slitless spectroscope were to be in charge of my
 wife and myself ; (2) the analyzing slit spectroscope was in charge
 of Prof. Barker, with the especial object of ascertaining the pre
sence of bright lines or else of dark Fraunhofer lines in the corona ;
(3) the polariscopic examinations were confided to Professor Morton,
 who was also to spend a few moments in looking for bright or dark
 lines with a hand spectroscope ; (4) Mr. Edison carried with him
 one of his newly invented tasimeters with the batteries, resistance
coils, Thomson's galvanometer, etc., required to determine whether
 the heat of the corona could be measured.
     This entire programme was successfully carried out ; and good for
 tune attended us in every particular.        The results obtained were : —
 1st, the spectrum of the corona was photographed, and shown to
 be of the same character as that of the sun, and not due to a special
  incandescent gas ; 2nd, a fine photograph of the corona was ob
 tained, extending, in some parts, to a height of more than twenty
 minutes of arc — that is, more than 500,000 miles ; 3rd, the Fraun-
  hofer dark lines were observed by both Professors Barker and
 Morton in the corona ; 4th, the polarization was shown by Pro
 fessor Morton to be such as would answer to reflected solar light ;
 5th, Mr. Edison found that the heat of the corona was sufficient to
  send the index beam of light entirely off the scale of the galvano
  meter.     Some negative results were also reached, the principal
 one being that the 1474K, or so-called corona line, was either very
  faint or else not present at all in the upper part of the corona,
  because it could not be observed with a slitless spectroscope, and
 the slit spectroscope only showed it close to the sun.
     The general conclusion that follows from these results is, that
 on this occasion we have ascertained the true nature of the corona,
 viz. : —it shines by light reflected from the sun by a cloud of
 meteors surrounding that luminary, and that on former occasions
 it has been infiltrated with materials thrown up from the chromo
 sphere, notably with the 1474 matter and hydrogen.             As the chro
 mosphere    is  now   quiescent,  this infiltration  has  taken place to a
 scarcely perceptible degree recently.            This explanation of the

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              319
nature of the corona reconciles itself so well with many facts that
have been difficult to explain, such as the low pressure at the sur
face of the sun, that it gains thereby additional strength.
    The station occupied by my temporary observatory was Raw-
lins (latitude 41° 48' 50", longitude 2h 0m 44" W. of Washington,
height 6732 feet above the sea), on the line of the Union Pacific
railroad, because, while it was near the central line of totality, it
had also the advantages of being supplied with water from the
granite of the Cherokee Mountain and of having a repair-shop
where mechanical work could be done.       I knew by former experience
 that the air there was dry and apt to bo cloudless : in this parti
cular our anticipations were more than fulfilled by the event ; for
the day of totality was almost without a cloud, and the dew-point
 was more than 34° F. below the temperature.
    The instruments we took with us were as follows, and weighed
altogether almost a ton : — (1) An equatorial mounting with spring
governor driving-clock, loaned by Professor Pickering, Director of
Harvard Observatory.         (2) A telescope of five and a quarter inches
aperture    and  eeventy-eight inches focal length, furnished with a
lens specially corrected for photography, by Alvan Clark & Sons.
(3) A quadruple achromatic objective of six inches aperture and
twenty-one inches focal length, loaned by Messrs. E. and H. T.
 Anthony, of New York ; to this lens was attached a Rutherfurd
 diffraction grating nearly two inches square, ruled on speculum-
 metal. The arrangement, with its plate-holders, etc., will be desig
 nated as a phototelespectroscope.          (4) A four-inch achromatic
 telescope  with Merz   direct-vision spectroscope, brought by Professor
 Barker from the collection of the University of Pennsylvania.
  (5) A four-inch achromatic telescope, also brought by Professor
 Barker ; to it was attached Edison's tasimeter. Besides these there
  were polariscopes, a grating spectroscope, an eye slitless spectro
 scope with two-inch telescope, and, finally, a full set of chemicals
 for Anthony's lightning collodion process, which in my experience
 is fully three times quicker than any other process.
     The arrangement of the phototelespectroscope requires further
  description ; for success in the work it was intended to do, vi/,.
  photographing the diffraction spectrum of the corona, was difficult,
  and in the opinion of many of my friends impossible.        In order to
  have every chance of success, it is necessary to procure a lens of
  large aperture and the shortest attainable focal length, and to havo
  a grating of the largest size adjusted in such a way as to utilize
  the beam of light to the best advantage. Moreover the apparatus
  must be mounted equatorially and driven by clockwork, so that the
  exposure may last the whole time of totality ; and the photographic
  work must be done by the most sensitive wet process. After some
  experiments during the summer of 1877 and the spring of 1878,
  the following form was adopted.
     The lens being of six inches aperture and twenty-one inches focal
  length, gave an image of the sun less than one quarter of an inch
  in diameter and of extreme brilliancy.        Before the beam of light

    320               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
    from the lens reached      a focus it was intercepted by the Rutherford
    grating set at an angle of sixty degrees.         This threw the beam on
    one side and produced there three images — a central one of the sun
    and on either side of it a spectrum ; these were received on three
    separate sensitive plates.         One of these spectra was dispersed
    twice as much as the other — that            gave is,  photograph twice as
                                                                  a
    long.   This last photograph was actually about two inches long in

322       Mr. T. Gray on  the Experimental Determination
a globe    of the same magnetic moment as the earth. He
found that this bar must contain 3'55 kilogrammes of the
steel of which his magnets were made.
   No experiments, however, have been made and published
hitherto (so far as  I know) having for their object the deter
mination of the magnetic moments of steel magnets of different
tempers and tempered by different methods, or which give
information as to the permanence or non-permanence of the
magnetism of such bars when left undisturbed for any consi
derable time. The experiments described below were under
taken with the view of supplying some approximately accurate
information on these points, and also as to whether a hard or
soft quality of steel gave the stronger magnets. They were
performed in the Physical Laboratory of the University of
Glasgow.      The experiments on the effect of temper were all
made on small bars cut from a wire of soft carbon steel.
   The apparatus used is shown in the accompanying diagram
(PL V.). M represents the magnetometer, which is a reflect
ing instrument consisting of a small mirror about one centi
metre in diameter, carrying, cemented to its back, four small
needles about O8 centimetre long, and suspended by a single
silk fibre ten centimetres long, which passes down a narrow slit
cut in the front of a wooden upright fixed to the base. This
slit terminates in a small cell, in which the mirror hangs. The
slit and cell being closed in front by a glass plate, a dead-beat
arrangement is obtained similar to that of Thomson's reflecting
galvanometer.     B B is a bar of wood capable of turning round
the vertical axis R, which, by means of a brass spring S is
made to bear against two brass V's, one of which is fixed
to the upper and the other to the under side of B B.
A A are two arms of wood (shown in plan at the foot of the
diagram), each of them fixed to B B by means of two thin
wooden strips W. As will be seen from the plan of the arms,
these strips were, in every position in which they were placed,
in a vertical plane passing through the axis R.
   The upper side of the bars A A was on a level with the
centre of the mirror ; and along the centre of them a small
V-groove was cut, the line of which was arranged to pass
through the centre of the mirror.        The axis of a magnet
placed in this groove could evidently, by turning the arms
A A, be caused to make any desired angle with the magnetic
meridian ; and hence the instrument could be used either as a
sine or tangent instrument.      L is an ordinary galvanometer-
lamp, and M a scale of half-millimetres placed at a distance of
one metre from the plane of the mirror.
   The image of a fine wire, fixed vertically at F, was brought

             of Magnetic Moments in Absolute Measure.           323
to a focus on the scale by sliding L to the proper distance from
the mirror, and served as an index by means of which the de
flection was read.    The distance of any point on either of the
arms A A from the mirror was found by referring it to a fine
line marked on the upper surface of each of the arms by a
sharp point attached to a fixed support above in such a
position as just to bear on the upper surface of the arms when
they were turned under it. The distance of this line from the
axis was evidently the same for each of the arms ; and half
the total distance between the two lines thus drawn gave
the distance of either.
    The plane of the magnetometer-needles was made to pass
through the axis by first placing the magnetometer in such
a position on the stand that this condition was approximately
fulfilled, and then adjusting it by means of the levelling-
screws at the base of the instrument until the deflections given
on the scale by a magnet placed in the V-groove on one of the
arms, when the arm was turned so that the magnet was alter
nately due east and due west of the centre of the mirror, were
 equal. In order that the magnetometer might be removed
 from the stand when desired, and replaced in exactly the same
 position, Sir William Thomson's geometrical arrangement was
employed.      One of the three rounded feet of the instrument
 was made to rest in a conical hollow cut in the upper surface
of the stand, another in a V-groove cut with its axis in line
with the centre of the conical hollow, and the remaining foot
on the plane upper surface of the stand.
    The mode of experimenting was as follows : — A large
 number of cylindrical steel bars were cut from the same bar,
the diameter of which was '097 centimetre, its weight per
 metre 5'77 grammes, and its density 7-83.
    Before being tempered the bars were carefully filed to a
uniform length of five centimetres. Their lengths were com
pared with a scale of half-millimetres by means of a lens.
About sixty of these bars, in order that they might be heated as
 nearly as possible to the same temperature, were spread on the
 bottom of a small thin iron tray, and the whole raised to a bright
 red heat in the heart of a glowing fire. To temper the bars glass-
 hard, the tray with its contents was quickly removed from the
 fire and plunged into water at about 15° Centigrade. The bars
 were then made up into parcels of five each, and placed in a
 vessel containing oil.    The whole was then heated by means
 of Bunsen lamp,
     a                and  parcels of the bars removed at each of
 the following temperatures— 100°, 150°, 200°, 240°, 250°,
 260°, 270°, 280°, 300°, 310°. While this process was going
 on, the heated oil was taken advantage of to temper a number

324         Mr. T. Gray on    the   Experimental Determination
of separate parcels by plunging them, after having been heated
to a bright red heat, into oil of various temperatures.  These
bars were not again heated.   All the bars were then magnetized
by the current from ten of Thomson's Tray Daniells, flowing
through a magnetizing coil, of the same length as the bars,
made of insulated copper wire.      This coil consisted of four
layers  of forty turns each, and had  a resistance of '065 ohm.
   Thus, taking the electromotive force of a Tray Daniell as
108 C.G.S. units, and its resistance    as •1 ohm or 108 C.G.S.
units, the current was, in absolute measure, approximately,
           This was distributed       over 160 turns of a solenoid five
centimetres long     ;   and therefore the magnetizing       force was
V065
       X
           IT x 4"-= 377    nearly.
   Before the magnetic moments could be calculated, it was of
course necessary to determine the horizontal component of the
earth's magnetic force at the place where the magnetometer
was to stand during the experiment.         This was done by
observing  the period of oscillation, under the horizontal com
ponent of the earth's force, of five separate magnets, each
suspended by a silk fibre about thirty centimetres long, and
enclosed in a glass case placed on the magnetometer-stand.
The magnetometer was then placed on its stand, and the
deflection of its needle by each of these magnets, placed
with its centre at a distance of twenty centimetres from the
needle, observed.    A reading was taken with the magnet
resting in the groove on the arm A, which was placed in an
east-and-west direction.   The arm was then turned through
180°, and a reading taken with the magnet in its new position.
   The same operations were repeated with the ends of the
magnet reversed, and the arithmetic mean of these four read
ings taken as the deflection on the scale.
   The formulas for deducing the horizontal component and
the magnetic moment are easily obtained, as follows : —
  Let H = horizontal       component of the earth's magnetic
                   force.
           T = period of vibration of magnet under H.

                through its centre at right angles to its length.
           r = distance of centre of magnet from centre of
                  needle.
           a = virtual half-length of the magnet (that           is,   half
                the distance beteen its poles).
           0 = deflection of needle in degrees.
           M = moment of magnet.

   These formulas were used in preference to the approximate
formulas which they become when a      struck out, and which

   In  the determination of the magnetic moments no correc
tion of the value of H was made for induction.
   The magnets were then magnetized a second time by means
of the current from twenty double tray-cells flowing through
a magnetizing coil of the same length as the magnets, con
sisting of ten layers of wire of seventy turns each, and having a
resistance of 2'15 ohms.       By the same method as before, the
 magnetizing force is found to be 1100 nearly.            For ease of
 comparison,    the  moments   of  the  magnets   after the  first and
second magnetization are placed side by side in the Tables of
results. They show that the magnetizing force first employed
nearly saturated the bars.          A few of these magnets were
placed   between    the  poles of  a  powerful Ruhmkorff magnet,
when the increase or magnetism was found to be very small.
It will be observed from the Tables of results that one or two
of the magnets showed that their magnetic moment had been
diminished by the second magnetization.               This may have
been  due   to some accident ; but the results have been entered
in the Tables as they were obtained.
   To show the relative effects of different magnetizing forces
on bars tempered glass-hard and "blue," two bars were
brought one to each of these tempers, and were then magne
tized, first with a very small magnetizing force, which was
increased by small measured amounts, and observations of the
magnetic moments of the bars made at each increase. The
results are shown in the annexed curves (Plate V.), of which
the upper corresponds to the blue-tempered, and the lower to
the glass-hard magnet. The abscissae are proportional to mag
netizing forces, and the ordinates to magnetic moments.              It
will be observed from the curve that for every magnetizing
force the magnetic moment of the blue-tempered magnet is
greater than that of the glass-hard magnet, and that the differ
ence between them diminishes as the magnetizing force is in
creased.
   As will seen from the appended Tables, the results show
that magnets made of steel which had been previously
heated to a bright red and cooled suddenly in cold water,
were scarcely so strong, after the first magnetization, as those
(made of the same steel) which, after having been so treated,

             of Magnetic Moments in Absolute Measure.        327
had been again heated in oil to any temperature up to 310°
Cent., and afterwards allowed to cool slowly in air. By the
second magnetization, however, the difference between the
magnetic moments per gramme of the glass-hard and softer
magnets, though still in favour of the latter, was greatly dimi
nished, which seemed to indicate that the greater strength of
the softer magnets after the first magnetization was rather
due to their being more easily magnetized to saturation.
   Magnets made of steel which had been heated to redness and
then cooled in oil had a comparatively small magnetic moment
when they had been cooled in cold oil ; but the magnetic
moments gradually increased as the temperature of the oil was
raised till it reached about 150° Cent., after which the mag
netic moments were smaller the higher the temperature of the
oil.   This result was not altered by the second magnetiza
tion.    The magnetic moments of these bars varied from about
60 to 80 per gramme.
     Some magnets supplied to Mr. James White, Glasgow,
to be used as adjusting magnets for Sir William Thomson's
compass, were found to have, when magnetized by a powerful
 Rnhmkorff coil, an average magnetic moment of about 50
per gramme. Each bar weighed about 170 grammes, and
was 30 centimetres long.
    These magnets, when supplied by the maker, were com
paratively soft ; and their magnetic moments were slightly
 diminished by tempering them glass-hard and magnetizing
them.
    A series of experiments was made with magnets of the
homogeneous iron or steel supplied by Webster and Horsfall
for the sheathing of the 1865 cable.     Each of these magnets
was five centimetres long, and weighed 2-27 gra.nmes.
Their magnetic moments per gramme for the different tem
pers were as follows : —
                 Glass-hard                 20'22
                 Yellow                     17-18
                 Blue                       11-29
                 As supplied                12-09
     This shows a marked difference as to magnetic moment
between magnets made of this steel and the magnets used in
the former experiments.
     Thus the glass-hard magnets of the soft steel had a mag
netic moment of 74-3 per gramme, while the magnetic
moments at the other tempers were a little greater.       On the
other hand, as the Table above shows, the magnetic moment of
the glass-hard magnets made of Webster and Horsfall's steel

328          Mr. T. Gray on         the  Experimental Determination
was only 20*22, and that of the blue-tempered magnets little
more than half of this amount.
    With regard to the permanence of the magnets employed
in the first series of experiments, their magnetic moments
were found to be very little, if at all, changed by lying nine
months undisturbed in the laboratory.                    When newly magne
tized, the glass-hard magnets lost about 2 per cent, of their
magnetic moment when allowed to fall three times with true
north pole down from a height of 70 centimetres to a hard
paving-stone. Blue-tempered magnets by the same treatment
lost 10 per cent.              After lying nine months, the glass-hard
magnets when allowed to fall three times as just described,
lost 0"5 per cent, of their magnetic moment, blue 2-8 per
cent.
     The same magnets were then remagnetized and again
allowed to fall as before.              The magnetic moment, which had
been but little increased, was found to be diminished in the
case of those tempered glass-hard by 1*7 per cent., and in the
case of those tempered blue by 4'4 per cent.

      XLV.       On Multiplication by a Table of Single Entry.
                 By   J. W.    L. Glaisher, M.A., F.R.S.*
§ 1.   TN       the   British-Association         Report (Bradford, 1873,
       -L     pp. 22, 23)     I made    the following remarks in refer
ence to multiplication by         means   of tables of quarter squares : —
   "In 1854, Professor Sylvester, having seen a paper in Ger-
gonne in which the method was referred to, and not being
aware that tables of quarter squares for facilitating multipli-
                       *  Communicated    by the Author.

•832          Mr.  J. W.  L.    GMaisher on Multiplication
cations had been published, suggested the calculation of such
tables in two papers — Note on a Formula by aid of which, and
                          '
of a table of Single Entry, the continued product of any set of
 Numbers     ....   may be effected by additions and subtractions
                                           '
 only,  without  the use of Logarithms       (Philosophical Magazine,
                                     '
 [IV.] vol. vii. p. 430), ' and On Multiplication by aid of a
 Table of Single Entry (Assurance Magazine, vol. iv. p. 236).
 Both these papers were probably written together ; but
there is added to the former a postscript, in which reference
 is made to Voisin and to Shortrede's manuscript.             Professor
 Sylvester gives a generalization of the formula for db as the
 difference of two squares, in which the product a^2 ... aB is
expressed as the sum of nth powers of ait «2, . . . a,, connected
 by additive or subtractive signs. For the product of three
 quantities the formula is
                             '                            '
 And at the end of the          Philosophical-Magazine      paper Pro
 fessor Sj-lvester has added some remarks on how a Table to
 give triple products i should be arranged.
     " At the end of a memoir, " Sur divers
                                                    points d' Analyse,"

 en Tables     (Journal de l Ecole Poly technique, cah. xv. t. viii.
 pp. 258-265, 1809), in which he has briefly discussed the
  question of multiplication by a table of single entry.            His
 analysis leads him to the method of logarithms, quarter squares,
 and also to the formula
                         >=i {cos(a— 6)— cos
  by which multiplication can be performed by means of a table
  of sines and cosines.      On this ne remarks: — ' Cette maniere

  duced at once from
               sin a sin b=    % {cos (a— b)

                       + sin(?> + c— a) — sin(a + 6 + c)},
  by equating the terms of three dimensions we obtain

                     by a Table   of Single Entry.            333
as written down above, and so on, the general law being easily
seen. We may remark that there is an important distinction be
tween the trigonometrical formulae and the algebraical deduc
tions from them, viz. that by the latter to multiply two factors
we require a table of squares, to multiply three a table of cubes,
and so on ; i. e. each different number of factors requires a
separate table, while one and the same table of sines and co
sines will serve to multiply any number of factors.    This latter
property  is shared by  tables of logarithms of numbers,  the use
of which is of course in every way preferable ; still it is inter
esting to note the inferiority that theoretically attaches to the
algebraical compared with the trigonometrical formulae."
   The object of this paper is to enter in some detail into the
matters briefly referred to in the above extract.
   § 2. The method of quarter squares depends upon the for
mula
so that, with the aid   of a table of quarter squares, in order to
multiply   two  numbers   it is only necessary to enter the table
with their sum and difference as arguments and take the dif
ference of the tabular results.        The first table of quarter
squares was published by Voisin at Paris in 1817, and extends
to 20,000 ; and the largest that has appeared was published
by the late Mr. S. L. Laundy, and extends to 100,000.
General Shortrede's manuscript table, that extended to 200,000,
and so would enable five figures to be multiplied by five
figures, has not been printed.      Ludolf, who in 1690 published
a table of squares to 100,000, explains in his introduction how
it can be applied to effect multiplications by means of the
above formula.     The title of Voisin's work is Tables des mul
tiplications, ou logarithm** des nombres entiers depuis 1 jusgu'a
20,000, an moyen desquelles on pent multiplier tons les nom
bres qui n'excedent pas 20,000 par 20,000, et gendralement
faire toutes les multiplications dont le produit n'excede pas
400,000,000 . . . , par Antoine Voisin      ....By a logarithm is
here meant a quarter square, viz. Voisin calls a a root, and ^a2
its logarithm.      If
                    the sum of the two numbers to be multiplied
exceeds the limits of the table, but each of the numbers is in
cluded in     it,
               the multiplication      to be effected by means of
                                       is
the formula
Voisin    thus justified in stating that by means of his table,
         is
any  two  numbers     neither of which exceeds 20,000 may be
multiplied together but  ;   it  clear that
                                  is        the sum of the fac
                                              if

334              Mr.       J. W.   L. Glaisher     on   Multiplication
tors exceeds 20,000 the method loses its advantages, as the
 last-written formula requires three entries and a duplication.
    An ordinary multiplication table, or Pythagorean table,
giving the product ab for arguments a, b is of double entry', and
so could not be carried to any veryconsiderableextent on account
of the great bulk of the table.     Herwart ab Hohenburg's table
of 1610, referred to in §§ 9-12, extends to 1000 x 1000, as
also is the case with Crelle's Rechentafeln, which are in general
use ; but the Pythagorean table has never been carried beyond
this limit. The question of the reduction of the process of
multiplication to that of addition or subtraction is one that is
interesting both from a practical and historical point of view.
    § 3. In the Philosophical Magazine, [IV.] vol. vii. pp. 431,
432 (1854), Sylvester gave the generalization of the quarter-
square formula for the product of n quantities in the following
form : —
    " Let 0!,    03, ...
                     03,   be disjunctively equal to
                                   0B                       ... n; 1,    2,   3,

The first and last terms, the second and last but one, &c., are
                                                                ......             (1)

the middle      if
              n be even    viz. this becomes
                                    ;
     (4.6.8...
the last term being
                                          + &c.;        .......                    (2)
ifn=2m+1,             and
ifn=2m.       This last expression   integral, notwithstanding the
                                              is
factor    since each term composing
           £,                             occurs twice as, ex. gr.,
                                                    it              ;

                                             is
are the formulae given by Sylvester on p. 432.        The equation
(1)   isthere   proved by showing that the expression on the
right-hand side vanishes when aB =             and therefore when
                                                         0,

 §   4. The formulae can, however, be proved in the manner

                         by a Table      of Single Entry                      335
indicated in § 1 , viz. by equating the terms of the nth order in
the equation giving sin oi sin «2 - - - sin fl» as a sum of sines or
cosines.
    Denoting        by 2rsina the sum of the sines of the angles
 ±«i ±ai.       . . ±0", in which r signs are negative and n— r
positive, viz. denoting by SP sin a the expression which would
be written in Sylvester's notation,
            sn-aei-a^...-a0r                  a0r^i   a0r+1...        aei,,
and attaching         a similar meaning to 2r cos a, we have
      —

                                                                     )m2mcosa
 if  n=2m.          The factor £ has here the same explanation as
 before ; viz. each term under the sign 2m occurs twice over,
 and the £ merely causes it to be counted once instead of
 twice.       The truth of these formulae is readily seen by starting
 with sinasin& = £{cos(a— &) — cos(a+6)}, multiplying by
 sin c and obtaining the expression as a sum of sines, then mul
 tiplying by sin d and so on ; the general law then soon becomes
 apparent. There is a simple and direct investigation of the
 formulae by Mr. R. Verdon in the ' Messenger of Mathematics/
 vol.vii. pp. 122-124 (1877).
    The formulae of § 3 in the form (2) follow at once by equa
 ting terms of the nth order in the expansion of the terms in
 these trigonometrical formulae, or, what is the same thing, by
 writing a^x, . . . a^x for al, . . . an and equating coefficients of «" .
    We also see that if in the formulae in § 3, the exponent, in
 stead of being equal to n, the number of quantities alt . . . on,
 be less than n, and differ from it by an even number, the ex
 pressions on the right-hand side of the equations are equal to
 zero, and that in general, if we denote
 by   "S,raP,  then

where p ! denotes 1 . 2 . 3 . . . p, and p, n are supposed to be both
even or both uneven. It is easily seen, by considering separately

and some of the algebraical identities thus obtained are of
interest. An identity of this class is referred to in the ' Mes
senger of Mathematics,' vol. viii. p. 46 (July 1878).

 Laplace then shows that the values off(x,y) can be calculated
 by means of a table of single entry, if the differential equation
 obtained by eliminating c from the equation f(x, y) = c be of
 the form Sdx + fdy—Q, S being a function of o> only, and T a
 function of y only.
     It is clear that the formula
                 sin a sin b~  | {cos (a— V) — cos (a
 does reduce multiplication to addition or subtraction by means
 of a table of sines ; and Laplace's remark that tables of sines
 had actually been used in this manner for about a century
 before the invention of logarithms led me to search for the
 history of this curious method.
      § 7. The method in question was* called prosthaphceresis,
 often written in Greek letters •n-poa0afyalpeois, and had its
 origin in the solution of spherical triangles. A careful exa
 mination of the history of the method is given by Scheibel in
 his Einleitung zur mathematischen BQcherkenniniss : siebentet
 Sttick (Breslau, 1775), pp. 13-20 ; and there is also an account
 in Kastner's Geschichte der Mathematik, t. i. (1796) pp. 566—
 569, in Montucla's Histoire desMathfrnatiqves, t. i. pp. 583-585
 and 617-619, and in Kliigel's W&rterbuch (1808), article Pros-
 thaphceresis.      The method consists in the use of the formula
               sinasin6=£       {cos   (a— £•)— cos(a + 6)},
 by means of which the multiplication of two sines is reduced
 to the addition or. subtraction of two tabular results taken from
 a table of sines ; and as such products occur in the solution
 of spherical triangles, the method affords the solution of sphe
  rical triangles in certain cases by addition and subtraction
 only.      It seems to be due to Wittich, of Breslau, who was
 assistant for a short time to Tycho Brahe*; and it was used by
     * ChristmBnn, in his Theoria
                                   Lutue, states that the first inventor of the
 method was Werner of Nuremberg, who employed it in a treatise De
 Triangulix, which was never printed (Montucla, t. i. p. 684).

known at Cassel the calculation of one case by this prostha-
phseresis ; and Justus Byrgius proved it in such a manner that
from his proof the extension to the solution of all triangles
could be deduced.             Clavius generalized the method in his
treatise De Astrolabio (1593), lib. i. lemma liii. The lemma
commences as follows : —
     "

  sive in medio, sive denique nullo modo interveniat : quae res

      The work of Raymarus Ursus, referred to by Clavius, is
  his Fundamentum Astronomicum (1588).                  Longomontanus,
  who also assisted Tycho Brahe, in his Astronomia Danica
  (1622) gives an account of the method, stating that it is not
  to be found in the writings of the Arabs or Regiomontanus.
  Scheibel also mentions a manuscript
                                                " Melchior Jostolii logia-
  tica irpoa-6cuf>aipeinii astronomica" (1609).
      With the exception of Clavius,           I  have not examined the
  works referred to, but have relied on Scheibel and the
  other writers mentioned at the beginning of this section.
  It did not seem necessary to enter further into the matter, as
  there can be no doubt that the method of prosthaphaeresis is
  that to which Laplace's remark refers, and that it was used
  for performing multiplications, even when the quantities to be
  multiplied did not present themselves as sines and cosines.           It
  need scarcely be remarked that when the method was in use
   (previous to the invention of logarithms) the cosine had not
  been introduced; so that the rules for the different cases of
  sin a sin 6, sin a cos b, &c. were complicated, it being neces
  sary to frequently pass from the angles to their complements.
   In Kliigel's Worterbuch it is mentioned that, if other trigono
   metrical functions have to be multiplied besides sines and
                                        Z2

340           Mr.  J. W. L.  Glaisher on Multiplication
cosines, or   if a sine or cosine is a divisor, the process is more
troublesome — that these multiplications can be effected by the
formula, but that the requisite transformations are more la
borious than the multiplication itself, which is purely mecha
nical, while with the prosthaphaeresis method more care is re
quired and, in addition, it is more difficult to obtain accuracy
in the result. These remarks seem to be obviously just; and it
is clear that the method could not be a good one for the
 ordinary multiplication of numbers not given in the form of
 sines of angles, as four entries of the tables would be neces
 sary, besides very troublesome interpolations.
    § 8. Napier published his Canon Mirificus in 1614; and then
 the prosthaphaeresis method was at once superseded by loga
 rithms.    The latter process requires only three entries of the
 table in order to multiply two numbers, and, even regarded
 merely as a multiplication method, is greatly superior in every
 respect to that of prosthaphaeresis, which requires four entries.
 Before the invention of logarithms the object was to arrange
 formulae, of which numerical values were required, as sums of
 sines by prosthaphaeresis,so that they might admit of calculation
 by addition or subtraction ; since the invention of logarithms
 the object has always been to throw formulae into the form of
 products.
    Regarded as processes for effecting multiplications, the
 methods of (1) prosthaphaeresis,        (2) logarithms, and (3)
 quarter squares, may be compared as follows : — The first
 theoretically solves the question, but is impracticable as a
 general method.       The second is the best method, if only a few
 figures (viz. 6 or at the most 9 figures) of the product are
 wanted : if n numbers are to be multiplied together, only n + 1
 entries are required.     The method of quarter squares is the
 best if only two numbers are to be multiplied together, and
 if all the figures of the product are wanted. Only two entries
 are required ; and a table from 1 to 200,000 (which would
 only occupy a moderate octavo volume) would give the pro
 duct of any two five-figure numbers by two entries and one
 subtraction, no interpolations being necessary.          A Pytha
 gorean table of this extent would be absolutely impossible, as
 it would occupy 100 x 100, or 10,000 volumes similar to Crelle's
 Rechentafeln, which in the new edition occupies one volume
 folio (see § 10). The quarter-square method seems not to have
 been much used, partly because it has never become generally
 known, and partly because no table exceeding 100,000, and
.therefore available for all five-figure numbers, has been pub
 lished. Such tables are also only suitable for the one purpose
 of multiplication, while logarithms have a great variety of uses.

                   by a Table  of Single Entry.                 341
    The connexion between prosthaphaeresis and quarter squares,
and between the generalization of the prosthaphaeresis formula,
as given in § 4, and the formula for the product of n quan
tities as a sum of wth powers, viz. that the algebraical formulae
may be obtained by equating terms of the same order in the
expansions of the trigonometrical formula, is noteworthy ; but,
as mentioned in § l,the trigonometrical formula only requires
one and the same table (a table of sines), however many quan
tities have to be multiplied together, while the algebraical for
mula requires a table of squares to multiply two numbers, a
table of cubes to multiply three, and a table of wth powers to
multiply n numbers ; and to multiply n numbers, 2"-1 entries
would be required. We might, however, multiply two numbers
by means of a table of quarter squares, and then multiply their
product by the third number and so on (which would also re
quire 2""i entries); but we should only obtain the exact
value of the result if all the products were included within
the limits of the arguments of table, i. e. if the sum of the
largest multiplier and the product of the other factors be within
these limits.    Practically, however, the sine table would only
contain a certain number of decimal places ; and if we assume
the sine table to be perfect so as to render any number of multi
plications possible, we ought at the same time to assume the
quarter-square table to be extended ad libitum; so that the theo
retical advantage of the trigonometrical formula, as only re
quiring one table, is more apparent than real, if we admit the
repeated use of the quarter-square table.
    As just remarked, a table of sines, like a table of logarithms,
 is only available for obtaining results to a certain number of
figures; and the superiority of the quarter-square method,
when only numbers within the range of the table have to be
multiplied together, is very decided.

     The mathematical bibliographers and historians afford Tery
 little information with regard to the work.       Heilbronner {Eu-
 toria Matheseos, 1742, p. 801) gives the title not quite cor
 rectly, and adds,
                       " Docet in his tabulis sine abaco multiplica-
tionem atque divisionem perficere."         Kastner (Geschichte der
Mathematik, 1796-1800, t. iii. p. 8) quotes the title from Heil
bronner and his remark, and adds that Heilbronner could not
have known Herwart's method, or he would have described it
 He remembers to have read somewhere that the book con
tained a number of tables of products, arranged by factors,
like a great multiplication table.         Scheibel (Einleitung zur
mathematischen Bilcherkenntniss : eilftes Stuck, 1779, pp. 417-
420) gives the full title of the work, a description of           andit,
an example worked out to show how           it   is to be applied to
multiply numbers of more than three figures. He commences
his account: — " Der Herausgeber dieses colossalischenEinmal

thematiques, t.    ii. pp. 13, 14) gives a short account of the table
and the mode of using  it    when the numbers to be multiplied con
tain more than three figures. This    is introduced by the words: —

ence to     it in Leslie's    Philosophy of Arithmetic        (2nd edit.
1820, p. 246).        In  his  article on Tables in the  English Cyclo
paedia (1863), De Morgan, referring to this table, wrote : —
" The table goes up to 1000 x 1000, each page taking one
multiplier complete.          There are then a thousand odd pages ;
and as the paper is thick, the folio is almost unique in thick
ness.      There is a short preface of seven pages, containing ex
amples of application to spherical triangles. It is truly remark
able that while the difficulties of numerical calculation were
stimulating the invention of logarithms, they were giving rise
to this the earliest work of extended tabulated multiplication.
Herwart passes for the author ; but nothing indicates more
than that the manuscript was found in his possession.
The book is excessively rare; a copy sold by auction a few
years ago was the only one we ever saw."                Graesse (Tr&or
des livres rares, 1859-1867) says that by the book the use of
logarithms was first spread in Germany, which is obviously
erroneous.
     § 10. Crelle's Rechentafeln^liich also extend to 1000 x 1000,
were first published in two octavo volumes in 1820.            A second
 (stereotype) edition in one volume (folio) was published under
 the editorship of the late Dr. Bremiker in 1864.             This work
is well known, and is much used. From Crelle's preface to
his table in 1820, it is clear that he knew nothing of Her-
 wart's work, and was not aware that a table to 1000 x 1000
 had ever been published ; for he writes, " Das neueste und

  Paris, chez Valace, 1812 ;' and then he states that this work
 only extends to 500 x 500, and is therefore the fourth part of
 his own table. It is not a little remarkable that the first mul
  tiplication table of any extent published should have reached
  the limit beyond which the table has never been carried.
  That Herwart's idea was good and practicable is proved by
  the continual use made of Crelle's tables ; and but for the great
  bulk of his ponderous volume, the table would in all probability
  have come into use.         The invention of logarithms four years
  afterwards afforded another means of performing multiplica
  tions, and Herwart's huge work never became generally known.
   It is curious that from 1610 till 1820 no similar table should
  have been published, as it seems clear that the work of 1610
   was a failure chiefly in consequence of its inconvenient
  size.    Herwart's table is rare; but there are copies in the
   British Museum, the Bodleian Library, and the Graves

relating to the history of the table ; but the hope is there ex-
         that, considering the attention so large a work must

of the tables, his objects, &c.     I
                                   afterwards met with a corre
spondence of six letters between Herwart and Kepler, which
took place at the end of 1608, and throws light upon these
points. The letters are printed in Dr. Frisch's Joannis Kepleri
Astronomi opera omnia, t. iv. pp. 527-530, 1863.       Herwart,
who was Chancellor of the Palatinate of Bavaria, and a man of
mark in his time as a statesman, was a frequent correspondent
of Kepler's; and many of his letters upon chronology are
printed in Kepler's Eclogce Chronica. There is a gap in the
 correspondence,      however, between January 12, 1608, and
 December 5, 1608 ; and Dr. Frisch, in the notes to the Eclogw,
                                                            "

 nihil facerent ad Chronologiam, et maxima ex parte spectarent
 opus Herwarti arithmeticum, quod edidit Monachii 1610 . . ."
 In the first letter, dated September 13, 1608, Herwart writes: —
 " Ich hab bisher in Multiplicatione et Divisione sonderbare
 geschriebene praxin gebraucht, dadurch ich den numerum ex
 quavis multiplicatione productum, per solam additionem, und
 den Quotienten ex divisione resuitantem per solam subtrac-
tionem (absque tasdiosa multiplicationum et divisionuni ope-
ratione) gefunden."        He states that   J.Praetorius and others
who have seen      it, recommend him to have       printed and he
                                                   it          ;
adds that   if   he had not had this method (diesen modurn), on
 account of his continual occupations, and because he           notis
a good calculator, he should long ago have had to give up all
mathematical matters requiring calculation.        He sends a spe
cimen page of the Table, the use of which he illustrates by the
multiplication 945,678     x  587, and he asks Kepler to give him
his opinion upon the subject.
    Kepler replies on October 18, 1608, and remarks that tables
are very useful to the sedentary man, and "           qui perpetuo
                                                        ei,

volume, which cannot always be at hand.         As will facilitate
                                                        it
astronomical calculations he advises that short precepts on the
solution of triangles should be added.          Kepler then pro
ceeds — " Nam multis partibus expeditius est uti hoc tuo
      :

                    ly  a Table  of Single Entry.              345

tiplicemas et dividamus simpliciter, tune videmus quid aga-
mns ; et possnnt varietates triangulorum talibus praeceptis
comprehendi, quae memoria retineri facile possunt."           Then
follows a synopsis of the different cases of the solution of sphe
rical right-angled triangles.      Herwart writes on November 5,
and says he had found that triangles could be solved better
and more quickly by means of his table than by prostha-
phaeresis, so that Kepler was quite right.        He proceeds : —
" Darunter ich aber Vitichium nit gesehen. Dieser. a.biecs
ist universalis.    Weil man pflegt den Buchern ein splendidum
titnlum zu geben, ut reddantur venales, wollt ich gern dessen
 Gutachten vernehmen, ob es nit thunlich ungefahr so : Nova

sultans absque operosis ambagibus divisionis per solam sub
tractionem cujuscunque, etiam maximae summae, etiam ab eo,
qui arithmetices non admodum sit gnarus, citius quam ulla alia
ratione invenitur."      He then asks Kepler for his advice as to
how the book should be entitled in Latin and German, and
prays him to write soon.
    Not receiving an answer, on December 2 he sends a short
letter to Kepler, again asking for a reply, and suggesting that
                                "
perhaps it was not prudent so speciosum titulum tantillae rei
zu praefigiren." But immediately after, Kepler's reply [which
is lost] was received ; and writing on December 5, Herwart
explains that he does not expect an answer to his last letter, and
that he understands that Kepler has no suggestion to make
-with regard to the title, but thinks it should be shortened.  He
cannot understand the meaning of Kepler's advice, " Graeca
compositio imploranda, sed exercito," and asks for an expla
nation.
    In the last letter of the correspondence, dated December 12,
1608, Kepler explains that, as the title seemed long, he had
advised that it should be shortened by the composition of two
Greek words, as in %pvinire\ai;, po|ro/ctvSiivo?, &c., and con
tinues: — " Mihi quidem cum non occurreret quidquam hujns-

dividendi inextricabilibus.          Sed facile est exercitato, copiam
afferre similium compositorum, ut ex iis aptius aliquod eliga-
tur.      Mibi jam plura non occurrunt."             He then refers to the
 Tabula Tetragonica [Venice, 1592] of Maginus, and adds in
a postscript
                    " Titulus igitur talis :
                                                  'S.eiaa^deta sive Novae

candi et dividendi liberantur, ingenio, tempori viribusque ra-
tiocinantis consulitur."
     § 12. It thus appears that the table was printed from a
manuscript that Herwart used himself, and which very likely-
he had had made.            As for the word prosthaphaeresis which
 occurs on the title, it is shown by the correspondence that
 Herwart used the table for multiplications in general, and that
 it was Kepler who pointed out that by means of it spherical
 triangles could be solved more easily than by the prosthaphae
 resis of Wittich, and suggested the addition of the precepts
 for the solution of triangles, which actually occur in the pre
 face to the work.          The title suggested by Kepler was not
 adopted,    nor    was  his  advice about shortening it ; but it must
 be acknowledged that Herwart succeeded in obtaining a
 " splendid title," which also contained a Greek word. De
                                                "                    "
 Morgan explained the use of the word prosthaphaeresis                 upon
 the title-page of Herwart's table, thus: "Prosthaphaeresis is a
 word compounded of prosthesis and aphaeresis, and means addi
 tion and subtraction. Astronomical corrections, sometimes ad
 ditive and sometimes subtractive, were called prosthaphasreses.
 The constant necessity for multiplication in forming propor
 tional parts for the corrections, gave rise to this table, which
  therefore had the name of its application on the title-page."
  The correspondence,          however, shows that the table derived
  its title not from its general use in the calculation of astrono
  mical prosthaphaereses, but from the special prosthaphaeresis
  of Wittich for the solution of triangles. In a paper on Her
  wart's Table read before the Cambridge Philosophical Society*
  on October 25, 1875, which contained the greater part of the
  contents of §§ 9 and 11 of the present paper,            I remarked that
  the prosthaphaeresis referred to seemed to be most likely a
  method of solving spherical triangles, in which the product of

two sines, or a sine and cosine, was avoided by the use of a
formula such as sin a sin b = ^{cos (a— 6) — cos (a + b)}, adding
that Laplace referred to such a method. This inference is
shown to have been correct by the contents of § 7. Wittich
does not appear to have published the method himself, though
from the writings mentioned in § 7, and from Kepler's letters,
it is clear that it was generally attributed to him : he ought,
I  suppose, to be considered the discoverer of the formulae
sin a sin & = ^{cos (a— b)— cos(a + b)\, &c., which are really
the prosthaphaeretical         formulae.   Kepler's remarks upon the
difficulty     of using  the  prosthaphwresis for spherical angles, on
account of the confusion between sides and angles and their
complements, is interesting ; and it is for this reason that           I
have quoted so much of the letter of October 18.              The word
prosthaphaeresis       often   means   the difference between   the true
and mean places of a body in longitude or latitude ; but it
seems to have been vaguely used, very much as " correc
tion
      " is now, to denote small quantities to be added or sub
tracted to quantities obtained by theory, or by a first approxi
mation, &c. ; so that without a context its signification is not
precise ; but      I have not examined this point. In Kliigel the
word is derived from irpoa0ev and a^ai'pecrt?; but, at all events,
as far as the mathematical and astronomical use of the word
is concerned, De Morgan's derivation from irpoa0eais and
dtfrin'/H-rrii; seems to be certainly the true one.
    As it happened, Herwart's employment of the word irpo-
er0a<f>atpecre<os upon his title-page was not fortunate ; for only
four years after the publication of his table logarithms were
invented, all the processes of calculation were changed, and
Wittich's prosthaphaeresis passed out of notice.
    Kepler, as is well known, greatly admired Napier's inven
tion, and in 1624 published himself a table of Napierian loga
rithms.
    It will have been noticed that Herwart describes his table
as enabling multiplications to be performed
                                                      "
                                                        per solam addi-
tionem," and division
                                 " per solam subtractionem."       These
words would immediately suggest to a writer of the last or
present century the method of logarithms ; and it is for this
 reason, no doubt, that not unfrequently the methods of pros
thaphaeresis and quarter squares have been confounded with
applications of logarithms* Voiein, as mentioned in § 2, actu
ally called his quarter squares logarithms ; and this has added
to the confusion.

XL VI.     Magnetic Figures illustrating Electrodynamic Relations.
    By Silvanus P.' Thompson, D.Sc, B.A., F.R.A.S., Pro
   fessor of Experimental Physics in University College, Bristol*.

           preliminary communication to the Physical Society in
IN
        a
        February of the present year, the author announced a
method of studying and illustrating the known laws of the
mutual attractions or repulsions of conductors traversed by
electric currents.      The present paper is a complete statement
of the facts obtained in the experimental research which formed
the basis of that communication.
     While preparing a set of magnetic currents to illustrate the
mutual actions of magnet-poles, it occurred to the writer that
the mutual attractions and repulsion of currents might be il
lustrated in a similar manner by the figures formed with iron
filings.     He was awaref at that time that the lines of force of
a straight conductor carrying a current were a series of con
centric circles lying in a plane to which the conductor was
normal. The series of figures now published originates, there
fore, with the discovery of Faraday that the seat of the mutual
actions of currents and of magnets must be sought in the sur
rounding medium. Since the communication of the prelimi
nary notice, the writer has learned that one or two of the figures
had been previously and independently observed by Professor
F. Guthrie, but not published. Two others, Nos. 4 and 5 of
the present series, are imperfectly given by Faraday in figures
 18 and 19 of plate iii. in the third volume of his ' Experimental
Researches (Series Twenty-ninth) J, and without reference to

apparently overlooked § .
     The method employed for preserving the figures has been
uniform throughout the series. Plates of glass, 3£ inches long
by 3£ inches broad, were coated with a solution of gum-arabic
and gelatine, and were then carefully dried.                When the ar-

American Journal of Science for 1872, p. 263, by Professor A. M. Mayer,
that he has obtained magnetic " spectra " from electric currents in a manner
somewhat similar to that now described.        The figures have, however, re
mained unpublished and undescribed, so that the writer has no means of
learning how far the substance of the present communication may have
been anticipated.

rangement of magnets or of conducting-wires had been made
for the particular case of the experiment, and the plate been
laid in a horizontal position, fine filings of wrought iron pre
viously sifted were dusted over the plate through muslin, and
the plate was tapped lightly with vertical blows from a piece
of thin glass rod. When the filings had arranged themselves,
 and the plate was still in situ, a gentle current of steam was
allowed to play upon the plate, condensing upon the surface of
the gum and softening        it,  and thus allowing the filings to
 embed themselves where they lay. After the gum had again
 become hard, the prepared face was covered by           a    protecting
 plate   of glass,  on which  in certain  cases were   drawn   the posi
 tions of the wires    or  magnets employed.      The   figures,fixed in
 this manner are suitable for projection with the lantern upon
 the screen.      They can be readily photographed for transpa
 rencies, or for paper prints      ;  specimens of each of these
 methods of photographic reproduction are exhibited to the
 Society.
      Figure1    represents the condition of the magnetic field sur
  rounding the current in a straight conducting-wire, which was
  carried vertically through a hole drilled in the plate.            The
  wire employed throughout       the series was  a silver  one of about
 •8   millim. in diameter.     The battery power employed for this
  experiment was that of 20 Grove's cells arranged in two series
  of ten each. In some of the succeeding experiments less       a
  current was found sufficient.
      But for the imperfections of the method of experiment, these
   curves would be perfect circles, and the distances between
   two successive lines of force would be proportional to the
   square of the distance from the central point.        The equipoten-
   tial magnetic surfaces, being     always  normal    to  the magnetic
   lines of force, would be represented by system of radial lines
                                             a
   forming equal angles with one another. There appears to be
   no recognized name for the closed curves traced out by the
   lines of force around conductors carrying currents.              With
   great diffidence
                 I      therefore beg to speak of them as isodynamic
  lmes.     They are theoretically disposed about single straight
                                                     a
   conductor in a perfectly concentric manner, and at such dis
   tances apart as would be defined by the requirement that a
   parallel conductor, carrying a like current of unit strength,
   would do unit work in passing from one isodynamic line to the
   next.    The absolute value of an isodynamic line would of course
   be determined (like magnetic and electrostatic potential) by
   the work done by a like element of current in passing to any
   point in that line from an infinite distance.       No work  is  done
    m moving an element of    a    parallel current along an isodyna

350       Prof. S. P. Thompson on Magnetic Figures
mic line, jnst as no work is done in moving a magnet-pole
along in an equipotential surface.        The isodynamic lines
occupy, therefore, exactly the same relation to the element of
the circuit, as do the equipotential surfaces to a magnet-pole
or to an electrified point.
    Figure 2 represents the field above a horizontal wire carry
ing a current, and separated from the filings by the thickness
of the glass (about 1*7 millim.). The lines cross the wire at
right angles, and are really the projections of a series of such
circles as exist in figure 1.
    Figure 3 exhibits the form assumed by the filings when the
wire beneath the plate was coiled into a simple loop, a small
piece of mica being inserted to prevent contact where it re-
crossed its path.    The lines of the field within the loop run
longitudinally ; and their projections on the surface are mere
points, as the filings show.
    In figures 4 and 5, two wires pass vertically through the
plane of the figures, carrying parallel currrents, which in
figure 4 are in the same direction, in figure 5 in opposite
directions.    Ampere's well-known law of the attraction in the
former case, and of the repulsion in the latter, is well illus
trated by the forms of the magnetic curves. In the former,
where the parallel currents attract, the outer isodynamic lines
are closed curves embracing both centres, the inner are dis
torted ovals about each centre — the whole forming a system of
lemniscates, as would necessarily be the case, since the at
traction at any point in the plate varies inversely as the square
of the distance from each current*.
    In figure 5, where the parallel currents repel each other,
the lines of force due to either current in no case enter or
coalesce with those of the other current.    They form two series
of ovals of a peculiar form, flattened on the sides presented
towards the opposing series.
    The conception of Faraday, " that the lines of magnetic
 force tend to shorten themselves, and that they repel each other
when placed side by side," has been shown by Clerk-Maxwell,
who thus concisely states      to be perfectly consistent with the
                              it,
theory that explains electromagnetic force as the result of a
 state of stress in the medium filling the surrounding spacef-
 Faraday also observes that
                              " unlike magnetic lines, when end
 on, repel each other, as when similar poles are face to face,"
           "
 and that like magnetic lines of force," when end on to each
 other, coalesce.   The terms "like" and "unlike," as applied

to magnetic lines of force, refer, of course, to the two cases of
similarly or oppositely directed lines, the positive direction of
a line of force being reckoned as the direction in which a
north-seeking polo on it would tend to move*.                  The mutual
coalescence or repulsion exerted between the lines of force of
unlike or like magnetic poles is familiarly employed in the
experimental illustration of magnetic phenomena, so well known
 since the researches of Professor Bobison and Dr. Roget on
 the magnetic curves, and appears to have been recognized long
 beforef-       It is believed that the present is the first distinct
 attempt to apply similar considerations to the illustration of
 electrodynamic relations between systems of conductors car
 rying currents, and between conductors of currents and mag
  net-poles.
      The isodynamic lines, which are lines of magnetic force,
  tend to shorten themselves.            A very hasty inspection of fig. 4
  will show that if any one of the system of lemniscates were to
  " shorten itself," it would tend to bring the two centres nearer
  together. Consider each isodynamic line as a ring of some
  elastic material (as, for example, an indiarubber ring) stretched
  around a bundle of smooth wires, the cross section of the bundle
  having a perimeter corresponding in form to the isodynamic
  line under consideration.          The maximum shortening of such
   an elastic ring would take place when the enclosed area was
   made a circle.        In other words, the lemniscate-form isodyna-
   mics tend to become circles, and the two like parallel currents
  are mutually urged towards each other.
       In figure 5 the shortening of the isodynamic lines, and their
   approach to the truly circular form, could only be accomplished
   by the wider separation of the two conductors from each other.
   Hence the mutual repulsion of two parallel conductors carry
   ing oppositely directed currents.
       Figures 6 and 7 show the lines of force above the parallel
   currents when these pass horizontally below the glass.              In the
   case of like currents the lines coalesce.         In the case of unlike
   currents they repel each other, and pass between the two wires
   in a direction vertical to the plane of the glass, where their
   characteristic form, as lines, is lost. The observation that the
   filings adherent to wires carrying like parallel currents are
   mutually attractive appears to have been first made by Davy.
        Figure 8 illustrates the law of currents crossing one another
   at a point.       In the two quadrants in which the currents both

352          Prof. S. P. Thompson on Magnetic Figures
run to or from the central point, the lines of force tend to
coalesce.     In the alternate quadrants they mutually repel each
other ; and the angle of these quadrants tends to increase.
    In figure 9 one current is carried horizontally below the glass,
 the other traverses the plane of the figure normally.             The dis
symmetry of the resultant distribution of          the  lines  reveals the
 dissymmetrical nature of the force which tends to bring the
currents into parallelism.       Any shortening of the isodynamic
 lines would tend to move the vertical current from that qua
drant over which the lines are unbroken.              Figures have also
been obtained with two currents crossing the plate in a vertical
plane of incidence, but each at 45° to the normal. With some
distortion, these figures bear a general resemblance to figs. 4
 and 5 in the two cases of the currents passing through the
plate in similar or in opposed directions.           In the former case
their angular separation tends to diminish, in the latter to in
crease.
    Figures 10, 11, and    12 introduce the action of a vertical cur
rent upon     a small magnetic needle lying on the glass plate.
 In the first case the needle lies in stable equilibrium almost
tangentially to the isodynamic lines ; in the third its position
is reversed and unstable ; in the second case it is set at right
angles to the directive action of the current.            The dissymme
trical  action  of the forces on    its poles produces a couple tend
ing to turn it about its centre, as would be inferred from an
inspection of the lines of force of the figure.
    Figures 13 and 14 illustrate a deduction from the theory of
the magnetic shell.      A conductor carrying a current is acted
upon by a force urging it forward so as to make the number
of like lines of force included within it a maximum* ; that
is to say, a north-seeking pole is attracted into a circuit
on the side from which the positive current appears to circu
late in a right-handed cyclical order (or in the same direction
as the hands of a clock).       Similarly the circuit is urged back
wards from a contrary pole, and tends to make the number of
unlike lines of force included within it a minimum.                 In .the
figures   a current ascends through         the plane  of  the  figure on
the left, and descends through it on the right, in a right-handed
cyclical order as seen from the magnet. Hence a north-
seeking pole is attracted, and a south-seeking pole repelled.
    Figure 15 results from the action of two magnet-poles upon a
vertical conductor, which in this case is attracted between the
poles.
    Figure 16 illustrates the mutual tendency to rotation between
a magnet-pole and a conductor carrying a current parallel to
       * Clerk-Maxwell, ' Electricity and Magnetism,' art. 490.

the axis   of the magnet.       In the figure, where the vertical cur
rent passes upwards through the glass, the neighbouring south-
seeking pole (marked in position by a square dot) is urged
round the current with a couple tending in a right-handed
cyclical rotation.       The couple is reversed, and acts in a left-
handed order, if either the current or the magnet-pole be
reversed.      The contrasted dissymmetry so produced is very
curious, and the mutual displacement of the radial lines of
force of the pole and of the circular lines of the current is very
significant.
    Figures 17 and 18 show lines offeree arranged spirally in
the field. In these a current passes upwards through the glass,
while the pole of a magnet is placed vertically beneath : the
current, in fact, passes through the magnet. The form of the
lines of force is remarkable. No work would be done on or
by an element of a vertical current in bringing it up to the
centre along one of the spiral lines ; for the work done by it
in bringing it in the spiral path across the successive circular
isodynamic lines of the current would be equal to that done
upon it in carrying it across the successive radial lines of force
of the magnet-pole. The equipotential surfaces of this field
are consequently another series of spirals of an opposite cy
clical order. In figure 17 the current running up through a
south-seeking pole produced a right-handed spiral ; in figure
18, with a north-seeking pole the spiral is of the opposite order.
Since the magnetic potential decreases from a magnet-pole
with the inverse square of the distance, and since the inductive
action of the current on a point in the plane of the figure also
decreases according to the inverse square of the distance from
the current, each branch of the spirals would be described by a
moving point whose angular displacement from the arbitrary
zero is simply proportional to the distance from the central
point.     The results of actual measurement of the spirals at
successive distances of whole millimetres from the centre show
as near an agreement with this supposition as the roughness
of the method of procuring the curves permits. The number
of branches of the spiral will clearly be proportional to the
strength of the magnet pole. The obvious result of a short
                                                              "
        " of the spiral lines would be to produce a rotational
ening
movement, such as we know to be produced on a free-magnet
pole under the influence of a current traversing it longitudi
nally.

admirable photographic copies of the various figures.

 XLVII.      On  the Applicability of Lagrange's Equations in cer
     tain Cases of Fluid-Motion. By JOHN PURSER, M.A., Pro
    fessor of Mathematics in the Queen's College, Belfast*.
           ordinary condition for the applicability of Lagrange's
 THEequations to the        motion of a system is that the position
 of all its parts be determined as a function of the generalized
 coordinates or parameters which enter into these equations.
 When such is not the case, even though the kinetic energy
 may be expressible in terms of these coordinates and their dif
 ferential coefficients with respect to the time, the Lagrangian
 equations of motion are known not to be in general valid.
     A familiar illustration of this is afforded by the motion of a
 rigid body rolling on a plane so rough as to prevent sliding.
 Here it is evident that the kinetic energy can be expressed in
 terms of three coordinates defining the angular position of the
 body and their differential coefficients.      It is not, however,
 possible to express the position of all the points of the body in
 terms of these coordinates only ; and accordingly the use of
 Lagrange's equations in terms of these coordinates is known
 to lead to erroneous results.      It becomes, therefore, a matter
 of considerable interest to inquire into the grounds which
justify recent important applications of these equations to
 sundry problems of hydrokinetics, relating to the motion of
 rigid bodies in an incompressible frictionless fluid.
     This case, in fact, is in so far similar to that of the rolling
 body already alluded to, that while the kinetic energy of the
system can be expressed (in virtue of Green's theorem) in
 terms of the limited number of parameters which define the
position of the rigid bodies, it is clear from the smallest con
sideration that these parameters do not determine the position
of the particles of the fluid. It would certainly seem, then,
that we are not entitled primdjacie to assume the validity of
Lagrange's equations when applied to such problems, and that,
if their use be here justifiable, it must be in virtue of special
reasons.     To endeavour to supply the proof which is thus seen
to be requisite is the object of the present communication.
     Given a number of rigid bodies moving in a frictionless in
 compressible fluid, whether infinitely extended or enclosed in
a rigid envelope ; given also that the motion at one epoch is
irrotational, and therefore always so, — then by D'Alembert's
principle,

 Ac., let us suppose that the generalized coordinates are so
taken that one only of the coordinates, say q.,, alters with the
 time, so that the actual time displacement may be treated in
 the same way as a possible displacement Sqa.

The bodies, however, after              these two compound displacements
are in identical positions          ;   and consequently the displacements
of the fluid (S^ — S&)&,                &c., correspond to irrotational dis
placements of the fluid                 compatible with     position of the
                                                                   a

bodies momentarily fixed.                        We have then to show that, for
such a displacement,
                               2d m(x&x + ySy + z$z) = 0.
This is evident ; for the work done hy the momenta of the
particles of the system must for any possible displacement be
equal to that done by the impulse ; and the latter in this case
vanishes, as the bodies remain fixed.
  The same thing may be shown analytically thus: —

The first term vanishes, since the motion of the fluid in con
tact with the bodies is tangential; the second, since the fluid is
incompressible.
                                          Addendum.
  Sir William Thomson has shown, in his paper on Vortex-
Motion (Trans. E. 8. E. vol. xxv.), that if one or more solid
bodies are moving in an infinitely extended frictionless incom
pressible fluid, the motion of the fluid being supposed at one
mstant and therefore always irrotational, the impulse      e. the                   (i.
system   of forces which would at any instant,    applied to the   if
solids, generate the motion of the system of solids and fluids)
would, applied to rigid body, represent a constant motive. It
         if                    a
may be interesting to show that this conclusion follows directly
from the Lagrangian equations.
   First, let there be only one rigid body. Take two systems
of coordinate axes — the first (OX, OY, OZ) fixed in space,
the second (O'X', O'Y', (XZ') attached to the body.
  Let u, v, w be the components of the velocity of                                   CK esti

XLVIII.       Researches on Unipolar Induction, Atmospheric Elec
    tricity, and  the Aurora Borealis.        By E. EDLUND, Professor
    of Physics at the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences.
                          [Continued from   p. 306.]
      § 2.   Atmospheric Electricity and        the  Aurora Borealis.
IT good is known that the earth may
                conductor of electricity    ;
                                              he regarded as a relatively
                                               while, on the other hand,
the atmospheric air,       in  the dry state and under the pressure
to which it is subject at the surface of the earth, is a very
bad conductor.         Its conductivity, which depends almost ex
clusively upon      the  relative quantity of humidity which it con
tains, is consequently subject to incessant variations from the
double point of view of time and space.                 When the density
of the air diminishes, its conductivity increases           ; consequently
 there must exist at a considerable altitude above the terres
 trial surface a stratum of air the conducting-power of which
 is better, yet without being particularly good.               The terres
 trial surface, both solid and liquid, is therefore immediately
 surrounded by a stratum of air endowed with feeble conducti
 vity and subject to incessant variations. To this stratum suc
 ceeds another, the conductivity of which is greater and, as
 far as we know, sensibly invariable.                  The upper limit of
 the atmosphere has been fixed by astronomic methods at an
 altitude of between 70 and 80 kilometres.                 Truly speaking,
 these determinations signify only that the atmosphere up to
  that limit possesses sufficient density for its presence to be in
  dicated by the ordinary methods of determination.               That the
  atmosphere, though excessively rarefied,               extends  to  a still
  greater elevation is most evidently proved by the fact that
  shooting stars have been observed at nearly 900 kilometres
  above the surface of the earth.          These small bodies evidently
  can only     become    bright    in  consequence of a portion of their
  vis viva, transformed       into  heat  by the friction of the air, aug
  menting their temperature to such a degree that they begin
  to shine.      Now we can only perceive the falling body from
  the moment when it becomes luminous ; and it is clear that
  at that moment it will have already traversed a certain length
  of path in the rarefied atmosphere before attaining so high a
  temperature. Therefore the upper boundary of the atmosphere
  must be situated at a much greater distance from the earth
  than has hitherto been admitted.
      The magnetic action of the earth cannot be explained en
   tirely and in detail by the assumption that its magnetic force
  is due to a magnet of iron or steel situated in the earth, and

       On Atmospheric Electricity and      the Aurora Borealis.       301
making a certain angle with the axis of rotation.               The said
action is too irregular for such an explanation to be admissible.
Nevertheless the total intensity of the magnetic force is ascer
tained to increase in a sufficiently regular manner as we re
cede from the magnetic equator towards the magnetic poles.
If  we join the points of the terrestrial surface where the mag
netic dip has the same value, we obtain curves which, though
not forming true circles encompassing the earth and parallel
to one another, may yet be regarded as parallel circles drawn
at the surface of the earth, and having their centres on the
right line which joins the earth's magnetic poles.               If  from
the equator we proceed continually in the direction indicated
by the declination-needle (not in such a direction that the
angle of declination remains constantly the same), we obtain
magnetic meridians converging towards the magnetic poles ;
these meridians are not great circles, but yet bear a certain re
semblance to them*.          In general, and on a large scale, it is
 therefore permissible to regard the earth as a magnet the axis
 of which makes a certain angle with the terrestrial axis of ro
tation.     There is no need of a more exact idea of the magnetic
 condition of the earth for the exposition which follows.
     Let abed (fig. 9) be a section passing through the axis of
 rotation of the earth (which we will suppose to constitute a
 perfect sphere) ; ac is its rotation-axis, bd its equator, and o its
 centre. To simplify the question, we will at first suppose that
 the two magnetic poles are on the rotation-axis, the south pole
 in *, and the north pole in n. abod will consequently repre
 sent the northern lemisphere ; and we will designate by
 a,b,c,d, the upper limit of the atmosphere.            While the earth
 is turning from west to east about its axis, an electric mole
  cule situated in m describes in the same direction a circle pa
  rallel to the equator, and therefore forms a current which is
  acted upon by the two poles of the magnet.            If now we pass
  planes through the circuit-element situated in m and through
  the two poles of the magnet, these planes will cut the figure
  along the right lines sm and nm ; and if in the same planes we
  draw the right lines mp and mq respectively perpendicular to
  ms and mn, we shall get the directions in which the magnetic
  poles tend to direct the positive electric molecule (the aether).
      Let r denote the distance from the centre of the earth to m,
  p the distance from each of the poles of the magnet to the
  same centre, and I the latitude of the point m.            We remark
  at starting that the magnetic phenomena presented by tlie
  earth indicate that at least p cannot exceed in length the half
  of the earth's radius ; and, in consequence, we assume that p

   This sum, which we will name the vertical component, de
notes the force with which the magnet tends to direct the
sether (the electropositive fluid) upward in a vertical direction.
(If we assume also an electronegative fluid, this will be urged
by the same force in the opposite direction.)
   If now we consider an electric molecule which situated                                is
in the atmosphere or at the surface of the earth, for which,
therefore, r is >2p, we see that formula (A) will be equal to
zero at the polar point, and will possess    relatively minimal        a
value in the vicinity of that point.     Consequently the force
tending   to carry  the  electric molecule vertically upwards                                             is
nil at the pole, and minimum in the polar region. It follows
                        a
of course, and     besides proved by the formula, that the sum
                  is
is equal for the same latitudes in both hemispheres.
   Taking the component of these forces in direction making               a
a right angle with the earth's radius (the tangential compo
nent), we obtain the force with which the electric molecules
are urged along the tangent of the circle the radius of which
is r. We have thus —         :

                      and   the   Aurora B°realis.                363
  In   the equatorial plane this force becomes       = 0.
                                                        The electric
molecules situated in that plane move therefore vertically up
ward, seeing that the component of the force A is the only
one which acts upon them.         At the terrestrial poles (/= 90)
B and A are alike equal to nil ; therefore the molecules si
tuated in the parts themselves undergo no action from the
magnet. For all the other molecules, the distance r of which
from the centre of the earth is above or equal to 2p, the first
term of the expression (B) will be always positive.          For the
molecules of the northern hemisphere (that is to say, for the
positive values of the latitude) the first term will be numeri
cally higher than the second, and consequently the total ex
pression will be positive ; for the southern hemisphere (that
is, for the negative values of /) the first term will be numeri
cally lower than the second, and consequently the entire ex
pression will be negative.      For the same value of r, and at an
 equal latitude,  the  expression (B) will have the same numeri
 cal value in both hemispheres ; but this value will be positive
in the northern, negative in the southern hemisphere. It
appears, then, from the expression (B) of the tangential com
ponent of the force, that the electric molecules situated in the
terrestrial atmosphere or at the surface of the earth endeavour,
in the northern hemisphere, to approach the north pole, and
those situated in the southern hemisphere the south pole. The
vertical component (A) tends in the same way in both hemi
 spheres to move the molecules always further from the centre
 of the earth in their course toward the terrestrial poles.
    We will now see what is the influence which these forces
 are capable of exerting upon the electric state of the earth and
 the atmosphere.      The lower stratum of the air is a relatively
 bad conductor ; and we assume at first the ideal case that its
 conductivity is everywhere equal.       The vertical component of
 the magnetic force     in question then  tends to direct the aether
 (positive electricity) from the earth to the air, the lower strata
 of which consequently become charged with that fluid, while
 the earth itself, which is a good conductor, incurs a deficit of
 aether (that   is,
                  becomes electronegative).      The magnetic force
 being always in equally intense activity, and the earth rota
 ting with  a  constant velocity,    portion of the electric fluid
                                      a                             is
 soon conducted into the upper regions of the atmosphere,
 where the conductivity        better.
                              is         Arrived there, the electric
 fluid is impelled towards the poles by the tangential component
 of the magnetic force.      The aether (positive electricity) in this
 way accumulates in the atmosphere, while the earth itself suf
 fers a deficit of electricity (becomes electronegative).         This
 continues until the electric tension of the atmosphere      is  suffi

                    for instance, magnet sn (fig. 10) acts upon
                                            a
another magnet s,n,, and the latter      movable so as to be able
                                                     is
to take any position whatever in relation to sn, the magnet
e'n, will place itself in the direction of the resultant of the
action exerted upon         by the magnet sn. The action of sn
                                   it
upon  a  current-element situated at the point m, or in the same
place as s,n,, on the contrary, will take place in       plane nor  a
mal to the same resultant       the component, then, along this
                                        ;
resultant of the action of sn upon the current-element        equal         is
to nil.       If
             the circle abed represents section of the earth, the
                                                      a
magnet s,n, shows the direction of the dipping needle at the
point m, since we suppose s,n, to be in the direction of the re
sultant of the action exerted upon      by the earth's magnetism.
                                                 it
Therefore the action of terrestrial magnetism upon a current-
element situated in the atmosphere has zero for its component in
the direction     the dipping needle.
                       of
   At the equator the dipping needle takes horizontal posi      a
tion.   The action of the earth's magnetism takes effect here,
as the above formulae show, in        vertical direction upward.
                                                 a
If  then, the electric fluid of the atmosphere can precipitate
itself vertically into the earth, the force which produces this
effect must be sufficiently great to overcome not only the
electric resistance of the subjacent strata of air, but also the
action of the earth's magnetism upon the electric fluid of the
atmosphere or, in other words, the force must exceed the sum
                   ;
of the two obstacles to the motion of the electric fluid. We
must further observe that the action of the earth's magnetism
in the vertical direction upon a current-element situated in
the atmosphere        according to formula (A), greater at the
                             is,
equator than to the south or north of that circle.
   At higher latitudes the dipping needle has not horizontal            a
position, but makes a greater or less angle with the plane of

                       and tlie Aurora Borealis.                      365
the horizon.       Here, then, it is possible for the electric fluid of
the atmosphere to descend into the earth without the terres
trial magnetism opposing to it an obstacle directly, provided
it follows the direction of the dipping needle ; but in follow
ing that direction the electricity has a longer path to travel
 to reach the surface of the earth, and consequently suffers a
 greater resistance than if it could descend vertically.           At the
 magnetic pole the dipping needle takes a vertical position, in
 consequence of which the resistance opposed by terrestrial
 magnetism to the propagation of the electricity in the vertical
 direction is here equal to nil. From all this it follows that,
 all other circumstances being equal, the resistance to the flow of
 the electric fluid from the atmosphere to the surface of the earth
 is greater at the equator and in tlie equatorial regions than at a
  certain distance from that circle, and that the resistance dimi
 nishes as the dip of tlie magnetic needle to the earth increases.
      It is here that, in my opinion, we must seek the chief cause
  of the fact that in the equatorial regions the electric fluid of
  the atmosphere descends to the earth by strong disruptive dis
  charges, and in high latitudes chiefly by slow and feeble flow-
  ings, forming more or less continuous electric currents.              If
  we continue to charge with opposite electricities two insulated
  bodies at a suitable distance from each other, the electricity at
  last traverses the intervening space, producing sparks, and
  the two bodies are discharged.              That the discharge thus
  effected may     be  powerful    and   instantaneous, it is necessary
   that the bodies be good conductors, and the resistance of the
  intervening space great.        If the resistance is slight, the dis
   charge   commences    while  the  charge is yet feeble.      In propor
   tion  as the  resistance   grows    weaker,    the  discharge takes on
   more and more the form           of a   continuous     current.  In the
   equatorial regions, or in general in lower latitudes, the force
   of terrestrial magnetic induction acts with very great inten
   sity in rendering the atmosphere electropositive, and, accord
   ing to what has just been said, the resistance to a discharge is
   also very great.     When the aqueous vapour of the air con
   denses so as to form cloud, this becomes charged with the
   electric fluid accumulated in the air in the locality. The cloud,
   which is a good conductor, therefore takes an electropositive
   charge. It is unnecessary to say that negative clouds may
   also in turn be formed under the inductive influence of posi
   tive clouds produced in this way.            If  now the clouds have
   become sufficiently electric,     the   electric  fluid may escape to
   the earth by means of an instantaneous discharge.                 These
   discharges, or thunder-claps, then, take place when clouds are
    formed and when the electric resistance between them and the

366         Prof. E. Edlund on Atmospheric Electricity
earth is as great as is required.         Outside of the equatorial
regions this resistance    is  less, as has  been said, and violent
tempests are more rare.       Finally, at a still higher latitude the
resistance is so slight that the discharges are transformed into
slow and continuous currents, giving rise to the phenomenon
called the aurora borealit.
    That portion of the electric fluid which does not descend
into the earth by disruptive discharges in the equatorial re
gions is carried by the tangential component of the force of
induction towards higher latitudes, while its distance from
the terrestrial surface is augmented by the vertical component
of that force. These currents of electric fluid receive accessions
 everywhere during their journey towards the poles through
the inductive force of the earth's magnetism incessantly im
pelling into the atmosphere fresh quantities of that fluid from
 the subjacent terrestrial surface.       In proportion as the dis
 tance to the poles diminishes, the vertical component of the
 induction-force also diminishes, and the dipping needle conti
 nually approaches nearer to the vertical ; and in consequence
 the resistance opposed by the force of magnetic induction of
 the earth to the flow of the electropositive fluid to the earth
 grows less with the diminution of the distance to the poles.
  When the difference of electric tension between the atmosphere
 and the earth has become sufficiently great to overcome the
 resistance opposed by the induction-force of the earth and
 the subjacent strata of air, the electric fluid flows from the
 atmosphere to the earth.        The places where this phenomenon
 takes place evidently form a circle around the pole.            This
 circle is characterized by the circumstance that in every point
 of its circumference the vertical component of the force of
 terrestrial induction must have nearly the same value. In
 the vicinity of the poles the atmosphere receives only a feeble
  charge of electricity, the vertical component of the induction-
  force being there but very small (as indicated by formula A),
  and the tangential component directing towards those regions
  only an insignificant quantity of the electric fluid which enters
  the atmosphere in lower latitudes.
     The electric fluid impelled into the atmosphere by the ter
  restrial force of magnetic induction descends again therefore
  in two ways to the earth — either by powerful disruptive dis
  charges, or by more or less continuous feeble currents.         The
  former mode of discharge takes place chiefly in the equatorial
  regions, the latter especially in high latitudes.         The fluid
  which is not discharged disruptively in the equatorial regions
  is conducted by the induction-force towards higher latitudes,
  where the discharge takes place by means of continuous cur

                                   and    the   Aurora Borealis.                            367
rents. From this it follows that, the less complete the dis
ruptive discharge in the first-mentioned regions, the more
numerous and intense will be the currents in the second.
    We assumed above that the terrestrial magnet coincided
with the rotation-axis of the earth, and that the earth was
everywhere homogeneous and endowed with the same electric
conductivity.     Now the magnetic poles of the earth are not
situated on the axis of rotation ; or, in other words, the right
line connecting the magnetic poles does not coincide with that
axis, but makes with it an angle determined by observations
to be about 17°.     Moreover the conductivity of the air varies
with the time and place.      Yet these circumstances necessitate
only nonessential modifications in what has been said.        The
 circle abed (fig. 11) represents a section passing through the
rotation-axis of the earth and through the right line which
joins the magnetic poles. This line makes with the axis the
angle « (= about 17°). The distance of the magnetic poles
from the axis will therefore be p sin « — an expression in which,
as already said, p cannot exceed the half of the earth's radius.
    We will now suppose another plane passing through the
axis, and forming the angle v with the preceding plane ; and
we will consider the action of the magnetic poles upon an
electric molecule m situated in this plane.     During the rota
tion of the earth the magnetic poles describe circles the radius
of which is p sin «. The radius of the circle described in the
same time by the molecule m will be r cos /, r denoting the
distance of the molecule from the centre of the earth, and / its
latitude.   The relative velocity of the molecule m with respect
to the magnetic pole s will be obtained, according to what
precedes, by giving the same velocity to m and to «, but in the
opposite direction to that of the already existing velocity of
the magnetic pole.                       If
                           the time of rotation of the earth bo
taken as unit, that velocity will be denoted by 2i'p sin «. The
magnetic pole will in this way be brought to rest, and the
molecule m will move with the velocity

The relative velocity of the molecule with respect to the other
magnetic pole will be
                 27T   v     r2   cos2
                                     /    +   p2   sin2 « + 2rp cos    /   sin « cos   v.
Now    it obvious that these square roots denote the distance
            is
of the molecule m from the right line drawn through each pole
parallel to the earth's rotation-axis. Hence    follows that the            it
magnetic pole acts upon an electric molecule in the same way
asif  the pole were at rest and the molecule in rotation about

368        Prof. E. Edlund on Atmospheric Electricity
the right line drawn through the magnetic pole parallel to the
earth's axis. The squares of the distances between the mole
cule m and the magnetic poles will be respectively
           i9 + p2 — 2rp (cos I sin a cos v + sin I cos a)
and
           r2 + p2 +       2rp (cos I sin        a.   cos v + sin            I cos a) .
The forces with which the magnetic poles                                      s   and n act upon
the molecule are therefore expressed by

The former of these forces acts in the plane which passes
through the molecule m and the right line drawn through the
magnetic pole     s parallel to the axis of the earth, and the latter
in the plane passing through m and the right line drawn,
parallel to the same axis, through the magnetic pole n. It
will suffice for our purpose to seek the expression of the com
ponents of these forces in the cases in which             equal to 90°            v   is
and to 0°. This calculation will show that the electric mole
cule  ismoved further from the centre of the earth and carried
from lower to higher latitudes, that            situated in the plane
                                                           it       is

which the electric molecule           situated, the result obtained
                                             is                                                           is
that the electric molecules are driven vertically upward and
 at the same time from lower to higher latitudes.              For the
highest   latitudes, where   cos       minimum,
                                         /   is

 their horizontal   and  vertical  components, become very small                                          ;
 the electric density of the polar atmosphere cannot, therefore,
 be great.     Thus, although the position of the magnetic poles
is  eccentric, the upper regions of the atmosphere from which
 the electric fluid    precipitated upon the earth in continuous
                       is
 currents must describe a closed annular zone about the pole.
 But, as we shall demonstrate, this zone            not closed around    is
 the astronomic pole as its centre.
    We suppose the molecule m situated in the plane passing
 through the terrestrial axis and through the line joining the
 poles of the magnet.       By making = in the preceding for

force is =0. While the vertical component of the earth's
induction-force diminishes in general as the latitude increases,
the electric tension of the upper strata of the atmosphere, on
the contrary, is augmented with the increase of latitude until
the tension becomes strong enough to occasion the downflow
of the electric fluid into the earth.   The annular space of the
atmosphere where the electric fluid descends to the earth is
evidently closed around the magnetic pole ; it is characterized
by the circumstance that in it the vertical component of the
earth's induction-force has everywhere the same magnitude.
Formula (C) gives an idea of its situation.
   As we have seen above, the electric fluid flows from the
said space to the earth in the direction of the dipping needle
(of the inclination or dip of terrestrial magnetism).      These
electric currents in the rarefied air produce the aurora borealis.
It is evident that this phenomenon ought chiefly to be seen in
the vicinity of the annular space in question.      According to
the researches of Mr. Loomis, most of the aurorae boreales
appear, in North America, between the latitudes of 50° and

56° latitude — that           is,

from the magnetic pole.      This central line    denoted by the is

   much struck by the         want of knowledge concerning
the laws regulating the amount of change which chemically
active bodies undergo in a given time, and in what manner
the rate of change   influenced by heat, electricity, &c. Many
                      is
cases of change have been investigated and represented gra
phically;  but, as far as    am aware, no theory has been
                              I
given confirmed by experiment whereby, the temperature and
amount of active bodies undergoing change being known,
the amount of remaining energy at any time can be calcu
lated.   The nearest approach to such a theory was given by
Messrs. Harcourt and Esson in the Phil. Trans.' for 1867,
                                                    '
where they showed that for the case of hydric peroxide re
acting on hydric iodide,
the  amount of change was proportional to the amount of
acting substance, considering hydric peroxide as the active
body.

372        Mr.   J. J.   Hood on the Laws of Cfamical Change.
  A   thorough investigation on this point might lead to many
interesting facts in science, and a clearer insight might be
gained into molecular action.
   For instance, by a comparison of the rates of change at
different temperatures, all other conditions being the same,
the necessary data could be obtained to deduce the law of
temperature, and so find the point at which no action could
take place ; or, again, if analogous compounds, such as the
sulphates, nitrates, chlorides, &c., have an accelerating or re
tarding effect on the change, their
                                         " equivalence " might be
determined or compared — that is to say, whether K2 80^, or
 174 parts by weight of potassic sulphate, can perform the
same amount of work as Na2 S04, or 142 parts of sodic
sulphate.
   The cases of chemical change selected for investigation
would require to be under complete control, to allow of the
determination of the amount of change up to any period of
time, as it might so happen that the intervals of time between
 two observations would require to be equal in order to calcu
late the necessary constants required by theory.
   The methods of determining the remaining energy should
be accurate and speedy.
   When two bodies A and B undergo change and produce a
third, C, which does not take an active part in the change, it
will doubtless, by its mere presence, if not removed from the
sphere of action, either accelerate or more probably retard the
change taking place ; and if this effect be great, supposing C
not capable of being removed immediately it is formed, a
mathematical statement of the change would not be possible,
as the influence of C could not be determined.         If,
                                                         however,
the rate of change     so little influenced by the presence of
                         is                                         C
that  it may be neglected, theory of the action can easil} be
                                a
formed as   aguide to the experimentalist.
   The experiments detailed in this paper were made merely to
see how far the following theory of chemical energy           cor
                                                             is
rect, neglecting all retarding or accelerating effects of the
compounds produced during the action. By an inspection of
the results,    will be evident that this influence cannot be
                 it
very large.
   Suppose two bodies in solution which are capable of react
ing on each other to form new inactive compounds, and the
action taking place be expressed by an equation in terms of
the time and the amounts of remaining active bodies at that
time, on the hypothesis that the amount of change in an inde
finitely small space of time       proportional to the product of
                                    is
the remaining active bodies at that time. Let         A  and    B

    Experiments. — In the first experiments made, not knowing
how the rate of change was influenced by heat,          took every

care to keep the temperature of the water-bath perfectly
constant but in spite of every attention, the fluctuations
            ;
 were about ±'1° C. This,         afterwards found, could not in
                                    I
 troduce any considerable error. The flasks containing the
 experimental solutions were submerged in the bath, and were
 never removed during the experiment.           The solutions were
 freely exposed to the air, as     was found, after repeated trials,
                                        it
that atmospheric oxygen had not any perceptible influence on
 them during the time the experiments lasted.
    The active bodies used were (1)       solution of ferrous sul
                                                 a
 phate containing an indefinite amount of hydric sulphate,
 and (2)    asolution of potassic chlorate, the strengths of which
were accurately known.

374     Mr.  J. J. Hood on  the Laws of Chemical Change.
    For the determination of the iron, a dilute solution of po-
tassic permanganate was employed, the absolute strength of
which was never detennined, as the experiments were wholly
relative. For the experiments made to find the influence of
temperature on the rate of change it was necessary to express
the different solutions of permanganate in terms of one stan
dard, this being equivalent to using the same solution for all
the experiments.
    For measuring    the solutions, 10-cubic-centim.   and 50-
cubic-centim. burettes were employed ; the errors of calibra
tion were so small that they were in every case neglected.
    Experiment 1. — There were taken 100 cubic centims. ferrous
sulphate solution containing '5772 gram ferrous iron with an
indefinite amount of hydric sulphate, 10 cubic centims. po-
tassic chlorate containing '2104 grm., and 200 cubic centims.
water : total volume 310 cubic centims.
    •5772 grm. iron is equivalent to '2105 grm. KC103, by
the equation
                 KC1O3 + 6 FeO = KC1 + 3 Fe2 O3.
    All the solutions were immersed in the water-bath until
they had acquired the necessary temperature before mixing,
the iron solution being first run into the water, then the
potassic chlorate, and the whole well shaken.
    After standing in the bath five minutes, 10 cubic centims.
 were withdrawn as rapidly as possible, run into a small flask
 containing about 20 cubic centims. of water, to partially stop
 the action going on by the dilution, and the remaining iron
 determined by means of the permanganate, the whole opera
 tion occupying less than one minute. The time was always
 noted just when the iron solution withdrawn had run out the
pipette.
    As an excess of permanganate had always to be added to
 see the tint, '02 cubic centim. was deducted from the reading
 of the burette for the coloration ; but in many cases no such
 deduction was made.      When the iron to be determined was
 small, 20 or 30 cubic centims. were withdrawn for titration.
 The following Table contains the results of this experiment :
 the numbers under
                      " permanganate calculated " are calculated

of the active bodies present? Taking equation (1),
and supposing there is an excess of B sufficient to act on n
times the amount of A present, then, as before, B = wA, and
also /j = c«.   Since the amount of B rendered inactive is pro
portional to that of A up to any time, the above equation

     Since A and nA are the values of the active bodies before
 the action begins, they cannot be taken as the initial values
 when t=0, as the equation only applies when the change is
 actually going on, and the solutions require to stand a few-
minutes after mixing to allow the action to get into a normal
state before the first observation can be made, when t is to be
taken as =0. Putting y=A—«,                 or amount remaining    at

382       Mr.   J. J.   Hood on the Laws of Chemical Change.
  In all   the experiments given in this paper there is one
special point to which        I
                             wish to draw attention ; and that
is that only two observations are taken to find the neces
sary constants ; if these had been calculated for each pair of
observations and the means taken, better agreement with theory
would doubtless have been obtained ; but such a procedure
is apt to throw doubts on a theory, as to which, if it were true,
one observation should be as good as another for determining
the constants, unless large errors were suspected.
   Before selecting those observations which were to be taken
for the constants, the first few were laid off graphically, and
those which seemed to be the most regular were chosen.
                              —
   Influence of Temperature. Chemical decompositions are all
more or less influenced by heat, the effect being an accelera
tion of the rate of change ; but it is very probable there is a
point at or below which temperature no change can take
place, as in the many cases where an acid has not action on a
body at the ordinary temperature, while on heating to about
100° C. change goes on briskly.
   The relation of the rate of change to the temperature and
the point of zero action are possible to be discovered by the
foregoing experiments in a simple manner.
   It has been shown that the rate of change is expressed by
the equation
and if it be proportional to an unknown function of the tem
perature /(P), 0 being degrees Centigrade above the zero-
point, so that

riment under exactly the same conditions, but temperature
differing by n° C., the equation is found to be
                            b,=y(a, +       t),
we get at once the relation

            Prof. S. P. Thompson on Sinaural Audition.              383
but    it does not follow that   -f is also equal to this ratio, unless
the value for    y when t =0 is the same in each case.
     A   number of experiments were made to determine /(#); but
as the temperatures ranged only from 18° to 22° C., and they
are rather incomplete,       I refrain from giving them fully ; the
results, however, seemed to indicate that /(())-=02, or that the
rate of change varies as the square of the temperature from
the zero-point ; and on this hypothesis the point of no action
 was found to range from + 2° C. to — 2° C., or about the
 temperature at which the solution would become ice.
     In conclusion,    I may state that the following experiments
 were made.       An increase in the amount of H2 S04 accelerates
 the change, still obeying the law.         Ferrous chloride, in pre
 sence of HC1, is oxidized by KC103, at 18° C., approximately
 according to the law y(a + t) = b, the discrepancies in this
 case being caused by the difficulty of accurately determining
 the iron by permanganate in presence of free hydric chloride.
 Ferrous sulphate in hydric sulphate is only very slowly acted
 on by potassic nitrate in the cold, probably being too near
 the zero-point.
     I  hope soon to give the results of some experiments on the
 rates of change for the various chlorates, as potassic against
 sodic chlorate, and possibly get some relation between the
 dynamical equivalences of those salts.

      P. THOMPSON, D.Sc., B.A., Professor             of Experimental
     Physics in University College, Bristol*.
  1.   TN     a paper read before Section A of the British Associa-
       JL  tion last year (1877) on Binaural Auditionf, the author
  communicated the discovery of two phenomena : first, the exist
  ence of an interference in the perception of sound ; secondly,
  an apparent localization of simple sounds at the back of the
  head when led to the two ears in such a manner that the vibra
  tions reached the ears simultaneously in opposite phases.          The
  present paper recapitulates the former experiments, and gives
  some further account of the phenomena and of new methods
  of experimentation.

 sounds was demonstrated by leading separately to the ears
 with india-rubber pipes the sounds of two tuning-forks struck
 in separate apartments, and tuned so as to " beat " with one
                           "
 another — the " beats       being very distinctly marked in the
 resultant sensation, although the two sounds had had no op
 portunity of mingling externally, or of acting jointly on any
 portion of the air-columns along which the sound travelled.
 The experiment succeeded even with vibrations of so little in
 tensity as to be singly inaudible.
    3. The apparent localization at the back of the head of
 sounds whose vibrations reach the ears in opposite phases
 being a subjective phenomenon, was announced by the author
 as the result of the concurrent testimony of several indepen
 dent witnesses. Its existence was demonstrated by leading
 separately to the two ears the sound of two unison tuning-
 forks, one of which was slightly loaded to make its phase change
 slowly relatively to the other. The beats
                                             "       " were
                                                            described
as being not
                 " silences," as ordinarily observed when the dif
 ference of phase is half a complete vibration, yet as being
 " most
         distinctly heard, and seeming to be taking place within
the cerebellum.         Referring to this attempt to ascertain the
effect of bringing to the two ears waves of equal pitch and
intensity, but differing in phase, the author stated that a fuller
series of experiments was in course of completion.         The sequel
of the present paper records with what result those experiments
have been made.
    4. The telephone of Graham Bell, introduced into this
country at the Meeting at Plymouth, where the former paper
was read, furnishes a new instrument peculiarly adapted for
researches of this nature.       Both the phenomena recapitulated
above have been reobserved by a considerable number of inde
pendent experimenters, confirming the results announced by
the author. Thus it was announced by Professor Graham Bell,
in a lecture before the Society of Arts, November 28, 1877*,
that these two phenomena had been discovered by Sir William
Thomson when experimenting at Glasgow with the telephone.
    One important advantage of the Bell telephone as an instru
ment of research is that the phase of vibration can be inverted
at will, by reversing the connexions of the receiving-instru
ment, so that the currents traverse the coil in a reversed direc
tion, the motion of the vibrating disk being consequently also
executed in a reverse sense.        Using two systems of telephones
to bring to the ears    two sounds  capable of yielding interference-
beats, interference in the resulting perception of the sounds is

very clearly recognized.     I have not been able hitherto, how
ever, to devise any crucial experiment to decide whether the
interference is an interference of the sensations, or whether
it is to be attributed to the physical conveyance of the sounds
through the bones of the skull, and their mechanical inter
ference.
    5. Phenomena of Localization. —Almost all persons who
have experimented with the Bell telephone, when using a pair
of instruments to receive the sounds, one applied to each ear,
have at some time or other noticed the apparent localization
of the sounds of the telephone at the back of the head. Few,
however, seemed to be aware that this was the result of either
reversed order in the connexion of the terminals of the instru
ment with the circuit, or reversed order in the polarity of the
magnet of one of the receiving-instruments.          When the two
vibrating disks execute similar vibrations, both advancing or
both receding at once, the sound is heard as usual in the ears ;
but if the action of one instrument be reversed, so that when
 one disk advances the other recedes, and the vibrations have
 opposite phases, the sound apparently changes its place from
 the interior of the ear, and is heard as if proceeding from the
back of the head, or, as   I would say, from the top of the cere
bellum.     So distinctly marked is the apparent localization, that
                                     I
 it has been regularly employed, am informed, by Professor
 D. E. Hughes to ascertain whether a pair of receiving-tele
 phones are rightly adjusted or not.
     6. My recent experiments have been directed to determining
 how this apparent localization is affected by variations of the
 sounds in respect of (a) pitch, (b) phase, (c) intensity, (d) qua
 lity, and whether it is to be accounted as a physical, physio
 logical, or psychological phenomenon.      I  have made, finally,
 a few experiments on the binaural estimation of combinational
 tones.
    (a) After employing the simple sounds of tuning-forks of
 various pitches, and conveying their vibrations to the two ears
                                                   I
 in opposite phases by three distinct methods, find the appa
                                             "
 rent locality of the sound (the acoustic image ") to occupy
 an invariable position near the top of the cerebellum.       These
three methods are: — First, employing two india-rubber tubes
 of equal length, armed with either glass funnels or box reso
 nators, in front of which two tuning-forks are held, differ
 ence of phase being obtained by rotating one fork round on
 its axis, or by loading it to obtain a continuously varying
 phase.    Secondly, by employing one tuning-fork, but having
 a branching tube to the ears, and making the lengths of the
 two branches differ by half a wave-length.        Thirdly, by em-

ploying a system of telephones,    the two receiving-telephones
oeing reversed in action.
    For simple                           "        "
                tones, then, the acoustic   image does not vary
in position with pitch, if the difference of phase remains always
a maximum.        For compound tones the first and second of
these methods of experiment are impossible ; but when using
                       I
the two telephones, ohtain the localization in the same posi
tion for sounds of all pitches and kinds.     Indeed the observa
tion of articulate speech appearing to come from a spot at the
back of the head proves the phenomenon to be independent of
the pitch — that is to say, of the wave-length of the component
tones.
    I arranged  a Hughes's microphone with two cells of Fuller's
battery and two Bell telephones, one of them having a com
mutator under my control.       Placing the telephones to my ears,
I  requested my   assistant to tap on the wooden support of the
microphone.      The result was  deafening.   I  felt as if simulta
neous blows had been given to the tympana of my ears.           But
on reversing the current through one telephone,       Iexperienced
a sensation only to be described as of some one tapping with
a hammer on the back of the skull from the inside.
    7. The relation of the acoustic
                                       " image " to the difference
of phase (6) between the two separate sounds is a more difficult
matter to deal with.     The method of the telephone here be
comes inapplicable, as it provides no means of partially chan
ging the phase of one of the two sounds.           The two sounds
must be either exactly coincident or exactly opposed in phase.
With simple tones, as of the tuning-fork, any desired differ
 ence of phase can be obtained by adjusting to the appropriate
amount the difference in length between the two conveying
tubes ; or by loading one of the two forks so as to make its
vibrations lose gradually on those of the other fork, and so
establish a regularly changing difference of phase. Both these
methods agree in showing, as far as accurate observation of
the subjective phenomenon is possible, that when the difference
of phase is partial, the sound is heard partly in the ears and
partly at the back of the head, the former partial sound dying
out and giving place to the latter as the difference of phase
approaches a maximum, and vice versa.
    A variation of this experiment may be of interest to record.
A stout copper wire about 3 feet long had its ends bent round
into smooth loops, and the whole was curved so that the two
loops could be inserted into the two auditory meatus of the
ears. An UT3       = 256) tuning-fork was then struck and its
                 (c'                                      ;
stem was pressed against the middle point of the copper wire,
the vibrations having thus to travel equal lengths of the wire

           Prof. S. P. Thompson on Binaural Audttwn.              387
 before reaching the ears.      The sound appeared to come from
 the ends  of the wire in the ears. The stem of the fork was
 now slid along the wire.       At about an inch and a third from
 its former position the difference of path of the two sounds
 had been sufficient to produce complete difference of phase,
 and the sound appeared to come, not from the two ends of the
 wire, but from the back of the head. In intermediate positions
the effect was of a mixed character : part of the sound was
heard as in the ears, part at the back of the head.             With
forks of various pitches,     a similar  result was  found,  with  ap
propriate differences in the lengths of path.
    8. The next experiments concern the relative intensities (c)
 of the two sounds.      When two simple tones in unison and
agreeing    in  phase are led to the ears, one tone being louder
than the other, the simple result of experience is that the sound
is heard in one ear more than in the other. It is as if the
 sounds were loud, but as if one ear were partly deaf.         But if
the two simple sounds differ by exactly half a vibration, and
one is louder than the other, the result is wholly different.
The sound no longer seems to be in the ears.             There is an
acoustic " image " localized at the back of the head.        Instead,
however, of this image appearing        to exist at the centre  of the
l>ack of the head as it does when the sounds are equal in in
tensity, it appears to be on one side, nearer the ear in which
the sound is louder.      If two unison tones reach the two ears
separately,    with  complete difference of phase and equal inten
sity, and then the intensity of one sound be gradually reduced
 down to nothing, the acoustic image, which at first occupies
a position behind the middle of the top of the cerebellum, gra
 dually moves round the back of the head apparently just
within the skull, to the ear in which the sound arrives with
 full intensity.    I have verified this result with tuning-forks
and tubes, and also with the microphone and two BeU tele
 phones, in one of which the intensity of the vibration could
be regulated by adjusting the position of the magnet.
    9. The effect of the quality (d) of a compound sound on the
localization of an acoustic image in binaural audition is very
 complicated.     The action of the telephone in reversing the
phase of all vibrations independent of their quality has already
been noted in § 6.
    A case, however, occurred, of some independent interest.
 Suppose a simple tone and its octave to be combined together,
so yielding a compound wave of definite form.           Suppose now
the octave note to be simply reversed, and in this condition
compounded with the original fundamental tone.              The form
 of the second compound wave will exactly resemble that of

the first, except that it is (so to speak) inverted end for end.
The two associated wave-forms might be, for example, the
two (A and B) subjoined.          The question arises, Can we dis
 tinguish between the two compound tones corresponding to
 these forms by leading them separately to the two ears — that
 is, by listening to them binaurally ? We have shown that in
 binaural audition we have a perception of a difference of phase
 for single tones. Can we go further, and demonstrate the ex
 istence of a perception of phase-difference in the components
 of a compound sound ?
     Helmholtz*, after a very careful consideration of the sub
 ject, comes to the conclusion that in ordinary hearing
                                                                 " the
  quality of the musical portion of a compound tone depends
  solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple
  tones, and in no respect on their difference of phase"          Mr.
  Sedley Taylor f repeats the statement in a more emphatic form:
  " The ear being deaf to differences of phase in partial-tones,
  perceives no distinction between such modes of vibration       ....
  but merely resolves them into the same single pair of partial-
 tones."
     To put the matter to the test of binaural hearing, the follow
  ing experiment was arranged : —Two similar glass funnels
  were attached to equal tubes leading to the two ears: their
  mouths were placed facing one point, but at right angles to
  one another.     If  a vibrating tuning-fork be held at the point
  toward which    the  funnels face, it can be so held that the vibra
  tions imparted by the two tubes shall be either alike or opposite
  in phase. For if the ends of the prongs be held towards one
   funnel so that the axis of the fork coincides with the axis of

 the funnel, and then the    fork be slowly rotated round its axis,
 the vibrations transmitted down the other funnel will alter
 nately agree with or differ from those transmitted down the
 first funnel, according to the aspect of the fork.       Two forks
 were chosen for the experiment, UT3 and UT4 (i/=256 and
c"=512).        Both were set vibrating at the point whence their
 vibrations could enter each funnel ; and they were placed at
first so that the vibrations of each fork reached the ears in
similar phases.     The compound tone was heard " in the ears."
 Then the UT4 fork was rotated a quarter round on its axis,
 so that it sent opposite vibrations to the two ears.      The two
 compound waves transmitted by the two tubes differed there
 fore like those of the diagram above. The sound of the UT4/or/fc
moved its position to the back of the head ; the sound of tlie UTi
fork remained localized in the ears. When the UT3 fork alone
was turned round a quarter, its sound alone was localized at
 the back of the head. When both were turned one quarter,
 both notes appeared to sound at the back of the head.          Here
 is a case, then, in which by listening  with  the two ears we can
 detect a difference of phase between the component partial
 tones of a compound tone.       And when we reflect that, except
 for sounds whose origin is in the plane coinciding with the
 median plane of the skull, the lengths of the paths by which a
 sound reaches the two ears are unequal, so that the phases of
 the vibrations received simultaneously by the two ears cannot
 be alike for all wave-lengths, we must admit that this binaural
 perception of a difference of phase cannot but be of importance
 in the appreciation by the ear of the quality of compound
 sounds such as those of musical instruments (in which every
 fundamental tone is accompanied by a certain characteristic
 series of upper partials), and of the sounds of the vowels.
     10. As to the cause of the singular localization discussed in
 the preceding paragraphs, whether it be physical, physiological,
 or psychological (that is to say, purely associative), 1 hesitate to
 give an opinion without further evidence. In searching for a true
  explanation we must not lose sight of the other phenomenon
  of the interference in the perception of sounds, though it is
 by no means certain that both phenomena can be referred to
 the same cause.       There is no decussation of the auditory
 nerves, like that of the optic nerves, to account for a blending
 of the sensations.    The portio mollis of the right does not in
 tersect or have any commissure with the portio mollis of the
  left after leaving the fourth ventricle of the brain, from which
 they originate.     This point deserves the attention of anato-
 mists and physiologists.

points involved are more distinctly recognized.
    11. The Binaural Estimation of Combinational Tones. — In
                        I                 I
my paper of last year remarked that had been unable to ob
serve the existence of combinational (differential) tones when
two simple tones ordinarily capable of yielding such tones
were led separately to the two ears. Thus the forks e' and g1
 (MIS and SOL3) when struck together give a differential tone
of 64 vibrations, or C,( = UT,), which is perfectly recognizable;
but when led separately to the ears no such tone is to be heard.
 But if the two tones be allowed to mingle and their joint sound
be led to the two ears by a Hughes's transmitter and two tele
phones arranged to yield opposite vibrations, then the differ
ential tone of 64 vibrations is heard accompanying the two
simple tones, and is localized with them at the back of the
head.
    Other experiments with forks of higher pitch have convinced
me that the absence    of differential tones is general when the
two separate simple sounds do not mingle before reaching the
ears. During a recent visit to the workshop of Dr. R. Konig of
        I
Paris, had the opportunity of hastily repeating this experi-
mejit-spon forks of shrill tones belonging to a series purposely
constructed for observations upon the combinational tones;
and the result fully confirmed previous observations.
    My paper of last year mentioned a case which seemed to
indicate the presence of summational tones.      The difficulty of
observing these is ordinarily much greater than that of obser
ving the differential tone, and in binaural experiments is still
            Further observations are still wanting on this point.
  t was remarked in my former paper that in binaural audition
freater.
dissonances are excessively disagreeable,      and the ordinary
consonant intervals harsh. No subsequent experiments have
been made upon this matter, which is probably connected with
the absence of the differential tones.
    12. One other phenomenon, as yet only partially investi
gated, remains to be recorded.      Let a small tuning-fork, such
as that used by pianoforte-tuners or violin-players, be struck,
and its stem pressed against any portion of the back of the
head.    If the fork be pressed against the parietal or occipital
regions of the head on the right of the median line, its sound
appears to be heard in the left ear ; if held against a region of
the head on the left, it appears to be heard in the right ear.
If, however, the fork be pressed against the region immedi
ately above either temporal bone, its sound is heard in the ear
of the same side.

                               Recapitulation.
       (a) There is an interference in the perception of sound; for
  two simple tones capable of interfering are still heard to inter
  fere when conducted separately to the two ears.
      (b) When two simple tones in unison reach the ears in op
 posite phases, the sensation of the sound is localized at the
 back of the head.
      (c) The localization of this acoustic "image" is independent
 of the pitch of the sounds.
      (i/) When the difference of phase is partial, the sensation is
 localized partly in the ears and partly at the back of the head.
      (e)  Jf the difference of phase be complete but the intensities
 unequal, the acoustic " image," instead of being at the middle
 of the back of the head, is nearer that ear in which the sound
 is louder.
      (/) It is possible to discern the difference between two
 compound tones which differ only in the phase but not in the
 pitch or intensity of their component partial tones.        For when
 two such compound tones are separately brought to the ears
 so that the vibrations of any partial tone present reach the ears
in opposite phases, that particular partial tone is singled out
and localized at the back of the head.
      (i7) When two simple tones are led singly to the ears no
differential tone is heard ; there is some evidence that summa-
tional tones are heard.
      (/<) To binaural audition dissonances       are excessively dis
agreeable,      and   ordinary consonances   harsh.
     (f) Vibrations mechanically conveyed to a point of the
 parietal or occipital region of the skull, at one side, are appa
 rently heard in the ear of the other side of the Lead.

vanced student.     After two introductory chapters (one kinematical,
the other physical), there are chapters devoted to rectilinear and to
parabolic motion, to central orbits, to constrained motion and to
motion in a resisting medium ; then follow a chapter of
                                                             " General
Theorems," one on impact, and, finally, a chapter on the motion of
two or more particles. The last of these sublects is treated under
the two divisions of free motion and constrained motion.        In the
second division no more than the case of two particles is considered.
The methods employed " are applicable to more complicated cases,
when more particles than two are involved ; but nothing would be
gained by such a proceeding, as D'Alernbert's Principle supplies us
with a far simpler mode of investigating the motions of any system
of free or connected particles" (p. 370). In fact the only case dis
cussed in detail is that in which two particles of unequal masses
" are attached to different points of an inextensible string, one of
whose extremities is fixed."    The solution of this question is ob
tained for small vibrations, in which case the integrations can be
effected in finite terms. There is added a discussion of the case in
which the mass of one particle is much greater than that of the
other, and the strings are not approximately equal. This appendix
is taken from a paper by Sir W. Thomson, " On the rate of a Clock
or Chronometer as influenced by the mode of Suspension."       To each
chapter  numerous    examples  are appended,  which  have  been  taken
for the most part from Cambridge Examination Papers ; many of
them would require for their solution an amount of ingenuity such
as but few students possess.
   Professor Tait gives by way of introduction a short history of the
book, from which it appears that Mr. Steele's share in the compo
sition of the First Edition was not very large, and, in fact, that he
died before its final arrangement and revision.    The Second Edition
was thoroughly revised and, indeed, recast by Professor Tait, who
thus appears to be the sole responsible author.     The Third Edition
was revised by W, D. Niven, Esq., of Trinity.           "The present
Edition has been thoroughly revised by Professor Gremliill, who
has not only at great labour verified and (where necessary) cor
rected the examples, but has endeavoured to adapt the book to the
present requirement of the Tripos by the free introduction of Ellip
tic Functions, &c., which, in my Cambridge days, were under the
ban of the Board of Mathematical Studies."        In short, it will be
seen  that no pains  have been spared to render the work as complete
and trustworthy as possible. And yet the author does not seem
very well satisfied with his work.    The fact is that the book was
written with a view to the requirements of the Mathematical
Tripos ; and this circumstance seems to have imposed restraints at
which Professor Tait chafes. Thus we find him writing as fol
lows : — Several of the examples " have defied all attempts at im
provement, and now stand in their unintelligibility as a warning, to
the Candidate for Mathematical Honours, of the ordeal he may
have to pass through."     Again, the text of the work is to a great

extent broken up into detached propositions, yet he states that in his
opinion
         " this is not the form in which such a treatise ought to be
written" (pp. vi, vii).     And with reference to the chapter of
" General Theorems," he says that several of the results proved in
it " have already occurred as immediate deductions from the laws
of motion ; but to maintain the special character of the work we
give more formal analytical demonstrations, though these are cer
                     "
tainly superfluous (p. 259). We cannot help thinking that the
unintelligible examples should have been omitted, and that the book
should have been written in the form that seemed best to the writer.
But if this could not be, and he were in any sense writing to order
and so obliged to compromise, surely it is somewhat ungracious to
proclaim his dissent, from what is after all his own act and deed,
upon the house-tops.       The fact is, if we may venture to hint at a
fault, the Professor's individuality is a little too pronounced.    If he
thought  it best,  on  the whole, not to act  upon   his private opinion,
it would have been better to have kept silence. Occasionally the
fault takes another form, And he indulges in some thing that might
almost be called autobiography.       A very curious instance of this is
to be found in the confession that, when he wrote the second
chapter as it stood in the first Edition, he had not so much as read
 " Newton's admirable introduction to the Principia."

A CONSIDERATION         REGARDING THE PROPER MOTION OF THE SUN
                  IN SPACE.   BT S, TOLVER PRESTON.
 IT   is ;i known fact that a wave emitted        in a medium does not
-*-
     partake  of the  motion   of the   body emitting it ; for when once
the wave  has  left the  body,  the  wave  depends solely on the medium
for its propagation.      Hence    it would   follow that, owing to the
sun's proper  motion    in space,   the  waves  emitted by the sun must
be situated excentrically about   it, the degree of excentricity marking
exactly  the  direction  and  velocity of the sun's proper motion in
space (or  in  the  aether which   fills all space). It thereby becomes
possible (in imagination   at  least) to refer the proper motions of the
sun and stars to one common standard, viz. to the universally dif
fused aether or
             :     it may be said that the direction and velocity of
the sun's proper      motion  (and that of every star)      is  physically
marked in the aether of space — each stellar siui marking the direc
tion and velocity of its motion with geometrical accuracy        bymeans
of the relative situation to one another of the spherical waves suc
cessively emitted, each of which remains immovable or unalterable
in position (in regard to its own centre). In short the centre of a
spherical wave may be said to represent indestructible position, in
the sense that the centre of the spherical wave        is  an immovably
fixed point, such that the intersection of the normals to two tangent
planes situated anywhere on the contour of the spherical wave

394              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articlet.
always marks the same indestructible locality (which is entirely un
affected by any subsequent motion of the body which emitted the
wave). In this sense it may be said to be theoretically true that the
locus or origin of any disturbance in a medium is for ever defined
in that medium.
   If we imagine a boat sailing in a smooth lake, and drop periodi
cally stones into the water, circular waves will spread each time
from the centre of disturbance, and the degree of eccentricity of
these waves to the moving boat (or to each other) will mark geome
trically the direction and velocity of the boat's motion.       So the
degree of excentricity of the waves about the moving sun (set up by
the disturbing impulses of its molecules) marks geometrically the
direction and velocity of the sun's proper motion.
   The following point in connexion with this subject may perhaps
be worth a passing notice.      It has been computed (according to an
estimate of Sir William Thomson, based on the observations of
Herschel and Pouillet), that the energy of the waves given off by
the sun amounts (in round numbers) to 7000 horse-power per
square foot of surface; or, otherwise, about 1700 foot-tons of energy
are thrown off per second from every square foot of the sun's sur
face into the aether of space.    It would seem incredible (whatever
the constitution of the aether might be imagined to be) that all this
energy could be given off to a material medium in a particular direc
tion     «. in
        (t.      adirection /rom the sun) without any reaction in the
opposite direction      :or would    be supposed that,
                                       it               ifthe sun were
emitting all this energy from one side only, there would be no reac
tion in the opposite direction       Admitting that there would be
                                       ?                               a
certain reaction in this assumed case, then        would be reasonable
                                                  it
to conclude that, as the case actually stands, the reaction would
not be perfectly balanced, owing to accidental irregularities in the
distribution of the differently radiating materials of the sun's sur
face.     Ifthis be admitted as possible, then we should have in the
unbalanced reaction        true physical cause for producing (or influ

encing) the proper motion of the sun.

ON THE DISSOCIATION        OF THE OXIDES OF THE PLATINUM GROUP.
              BY H. SAINTE-CLAIRE DEVILLE AND H. DEBRAY.
     Platinum    distinguished from all the metals with which
                 is                                                   it
is associated in its ores by the fact that        it  does not combine
directly with  oxygen,  in whatever   position we  place the two bodies.
   With rhodium, palladium, and iridium the case             isdifferent.
When heated in muffle,a        the temperature
                                  if               isnot too high, these
metals combine with oxygen but their oxides are decomposed when
                                   ;
we raise the temperature sufficiently.
   Osmium and ruthenium combine directly with oxygen.                The
product  of this oxidation    volatile,
                                  is    and  is formed   at the  highest
temperatures.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                   395
    The most strongly calcined osmium, much less alterable than the
osmium obtained at a low temperature, changes into osmic acid at
                          * ; at the
ordinary temperature                   highest temperatures osmic acid is
always    obtained.
    Ruthenium behaves altogether like osmium. The strongly cal
cined metal oxidizes in a muffle at a temperature scarcely above
400° C., and volatilizes in great quantity.         In what form, it is dif
ficult to say ; for the material then exhales the odour of ozone, the
formation of which always accompanies the decomposition of hy-
perruthenic acid. The product deposited in the muffle is always
the binoxide of ruthenium.         This oxide sublimates and crystallizes
in a porcelain tube traversed by a current of oxygen in which
substances containing ruthenium are heated. M. Fremy thus
proved its volatility, and discovered the means of extracting directly,
and under the most beautiful forms, some products of the roasting
of osmide of indium.        Buthenium also, which in the metallic state
is one of the most fixed substances we know, evaporates very
quickly in a muffle, especially at a very elevated temperature t-
    These properties absolutely distinguish osmium and ruthenium
    * The characteristic smell of osmic acid is at
                                                         length perceptible in
bottles containing oven crystallized osmium prepared at a high tempera
ture. The stoppers then become covered with the black coating given by
the reduction of osmic acid.
    t By operating on a few grams of ruthenium we have been able in a
few hours to volatilize 24 per cent, of its weight in a highly heated muffle ;
in the blowpipe flame the volatilization is much more rapid and still
more considerable in amount.
    From the fact that osmium and ruthenium volatilize very rapidly in the
oxyhydrogen flame of the blowpipe, giving osmic acid and binoxide of
ruthenium, it must not be concluded that these oxides are undecomposable
by heat. Osmic acid would be reduced, in the interior of the flame at
that high temperature, to sesquioxide of osmium, crystallizable in golden-
coloured scales, which we have made known.          The final result would still
be the same : this oxide, on coming into the air, into a relatively cold
region, would there be changed into osmic acid. In supposing that the
oxide of ruthenium is not decomposed into a lower oxide, it is not neces
sary also to admit that it is absolutely undecomposable at the temoerature
of 2500° given by the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen. This com
bustion is not complete in the hottest parts of the flame ; hydrogen and
oxygen exist there uncombined ; and il the oxide of ruthenium has a less
tension of dissociation than that of water at this high temperature, one
 can conceive that it may not be decomposed.        Oxide of ruthenium would
 therefore be less readily decomposable than water by heat. To discover
 -whether it is really undecomposable, we must be able to heat it (as we
 have pointed out for the oxide of iridium) in a vacuum to high temperatures;
 but, unfortunately, there exist no vessels suitable for such experiments.
 The hypothesis of the very great stability of the oxide of ruthenium,
 however, is supported by the fact that this oxide, heated in a porcelain
 tube, exhibits (like the oxide of iridium), at least at a bright red heat, no
 sensible tension of dissociation ; it merely volatilizes, and is deposited in
 the form of crystals and a coating of binoxide in the colder parts of the
  porcelain tube.

from the other metals of the platinum group.        These two bodies,
by the manner in which they behave in contact with oxygen, mani
festly approach arsenic and antimony ; they might, like these, be
placed among the metalloids.      It is not the same, we have said,
with rhodium, palladium, and iridium. These bodies once oxidized,
decomposing by heat, permit us to ascertain the laws of their dis-
Bociatiou and the tension it takes at different temperatures.        We
will only speak, in this Note, of the oxide of iridium, the only one
we have at present completely studied.
   The oxide is put into a porcelain tray, this into a small platinum
waggon, which is introduced into a porcelain tube closed at one end
by a glass plate kept in its place by mastic.     The other extremity,
by means of a lead pipe and a glass tube, attached one to the other
by mastic and to the porcelain tube, is put into communication
with a Geissler mercury pump, and a manometric tube dipping in
the mercury.
   Before introducing the iridium oxide into the porcelain" tube,
we assure ourselves that it maintains a vacuum at the ordinary
temperature and at a red heat, which does not always happen.         In
fact, porcelain tubes which are air-tight when cold, at a red heat
often let in hydrogen and carbonic oxide from the hearth.
 '
   The porcelain tube is introduced into a cylindrical muffle capable
of contaming at the same time a porcelain thermometer furnished
with its tube and compensator, of the form employed and described
by M. Troost and one of us*. The muffle is placed in a furnace
heated with petroleum or with heavy coal^oil, which is introduced
into the furnace through a piston-cock divided into at least 200
parts ; so that the flow of the oil can be varied, and consequently
the temperature, with a perfection that could not have been ex
pected. The oil-reservoir is furnished with a Mariotte tube, which
maintains it at a constant pressure.         With this apparatus the
porcelain can be completely fused.
   We commence by heating the muffle to the point at which the
tension of the liberated oxygen k from 30 to 40 centims. and
returns to the same when the apparatus has been several times ex
hausted by means of the Geissler pump.          We are then sure that
the composition of the undecomposed oxide of iridium no longer
varies. Then with the cock we lessen the flow of the coal-oil until
the pressure of the oxygen does not exceed a few millims. and
remains constant. This is noted, and the temperature determined.
   We then successively augment the flow of the oil in order to
obtain higher temperaiures and stronger tensions of dissociation ;
these are noted when they have become constant.          Thus the fol
lowing numbers were found : —
   *
     This apparatus has been simplified by employing a Sprengel pump,
which permits the thermometric material (nitrogen) contained in the re
servoir to he taken out and measured as often as we wish, and the tempe
rature to be calculated.

    If, after a determined temperature and tension have been attained,
oxygen is withdrawn by means of the Geissler pump, the mercury
returns to the initial tension, provided, of course, undecomposed
oxide of indium remains.           The dissociation-tension of this oxide
depends, then, solely on the temperature.
    If the temperature be raised above 1139°, the dissociation-tension
soon exceeding that of the atmosphere, oxygen is rapidly liberated
through the mercury ; when this has quite ceased, we exhaust ;
and on taking out the tray containing the oxide from the cooled
tube, we find in it some metallic indium, consequently reduced by
the mere action of heat.
     The tension of oxygen in air being about 152 millims., it follows
from the above-cited numbers that the oxide of iridium decomposes
 in the open air at a temperature below 1003°-3, and consequently
 that at that temperature, or at any higher one, iridium is absolutely
 non-oxidizable in the air.
     When we break the porcelain tube in which the oxide was heated,
 we observe that it is covered, in the parts which were but little
 heated, with a very thin layer of blue oxide of iridium — which de
 monstrates a slight volatility of this oxide at the relatively low
  temperatures at which it can exist.          Above 1000° volatilization
  becomes impossible in our atmosphere, since the oxide of iridium
  ceases to exist there and the metal is at least as fixed as platinum.
  We have likewise proved this feeble volatility of the oxide of iridium
  in other experiments, made with M. Stas. — Comptes Rendu* de

  ON A    UNIVERSAL LAW RESPECTING THE DILATATION OF BODIES.
                                 BY M. LEVY.
     Between the specific volume of a body, its temperature, and the
  pressure (supposed normal) which it supports, there exists, as is
  known, a relation which permits one of these three quantities to be
  expressed as a function of the other two — for example, the pressure
  as a function of the volume and temperature.
     Hitherto (to my knowledge at least) theory has supplied no in
  dication upon the nature of this relation, and nothing permits us to
  affirm with certainty that it may not change in some way when we
  pass from one substance to another.         For every substance the phy
  sicist is condemned to seek it in every particular by experiment,
  which, in a manner, necessitates oo3 number of observations.

398            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articlef.
    I purpose to demonstrate that this relation is far from being pos
sibly arbitrary—that the pressure supported by any body whatever, to
long at the body does not change its state, can only be a linear func
tion of itt temperature.     In other terms, under a physical form,      If
any body whatever be heated under a constant volume, the pressure
which it exerts upon the immovable sides of the enclosure which con
tains it cannot but increase in rigorously exact proportion to itt tem
perature.
    I say that this proposition is an absolutely rigorous corollary of
the two fundamental propositions of the mechanical theory of heat,
and of the hypothesis that the reciprocal actions of the atoms of
bodies are directed along the lines which join their points of appli
cation, and depend only on the distances of these points from one
another.
   To demonstrate the iaw above enunciated, let <fQ be the quantity
of heat necessary in order to modify infinitesimally the volume v,
the pressure />, and the temperature T of a body without it«
changing its state. The first principle of the mechanical theory of
heat gives the classical equation
                            dQ=d\J+Apdv,                               (1)
A=     = being the thermal equivalent of the work, and IT the fane-
       Is
tion which is often called the internal heat. Let us take v and T
for the independent variables, so that
                                          *2dv.
                                           dv
The signification of each of the two terms of the second member is
obvious : the first represents the quantity of heat necessary to pro
duce an increment dT of the temperature without change of volume;
consequently, and since there is no change of state, tho second ne
cessarily represents the quantity of heat equivalent to the work of
the moleculnr actions during the increase of volume dv.           Now, if
we represent by mm'f(r) the amount of the mutual action of two
 molecules the masses of which are ro and m', placed at the distance
 r the one from the other, this work is represented by an expression
of the form S»im'/(r)dr, so that we have identically
                                            c^dv.
                                            dv
The first member not containing the letter T, it is the    same   with the
second.     Therefore   — depends     only on the variable  v alone  ; and
 consequently TJ is of the form F(T)+/(f).        Hence this first con
            : — The internal heat of a body cannot be any
sequence                                                   function of the
specific volume and the temperature of that body; it can only be the
sum of two functions, — the one, of the volume alone; the other, of the
temperature    alone.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              399
    This first corollary also results immediately from the statement,
so luminous in its brevity, of the mechanical theory of heat, given
by M. Ri'.-ul in his Mecanique generate.
    We can therefore write
R being   a function of v only, and $'(T) any function of the tempe
rature.
    Observe now that, in virtue of the second general proposition of
the mechanical theory, we have, if T is the absolute temperature
and p denotes what M. Clausius calls the entropy,
Introducing     these values of dU and rfQ into equation (1), we get
which requires that we      have separately
                            3f
                                -Af(T)-0,
                            dv
 From the first we derive,     V  being an arbitrary function of the va
 riable v alone,
"We thus get this second proposition : —
     Whatever the body considered, the quantity called by M. Clausius
 the entropy cannot be any function of the volume and the temperature;
 in the same way as the internal heat, the entropy can only be the sum
 of two functions,
                    — the one, of the volume alone; the other, of the tem
perature alone.
                                               .......
    Consequently the second of the equations obtained gives
                                           T,
 which establishes the law above enunciated.
                                                                       (A)
                                                   Such is the necessary
 form which connects the pressure, the volume, and the temperature
 of any body whatever, R and V being two functions of v only.
    We said, at the commencement, that theory had not hitherto
 supplied any certain and general indication like that which is in
 question here. On this subject we must make one remark.                M.
  Him, in the last edition of his Exposition de la Theorie mecanique
 de la chaleur, very judiciously divides that theory into two branches :
in the first he develops the rigorous consequences of the two funda
 mental propositions; in the second he states a great number of

philosophical      views and intuitive results.       In the second part, par
ticularly, M. Him points out how one might, in his opinion, render
the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac applicable to all bodies, on
condition of adjoining to the pressure p, which enters into them, a
fictitious pressure R equivalent to what he calls the sum of all the
molecular actions, which would not be dependent on the volume.
He thus arrives at the formula
                           (jo + E) ^ = K = constant,
coinciding with the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac for E=0.
    It will be seen that this formula and our (A) would be identical
if it were admitted that, for all bodies, the function V, introduced
by our analysis, follows a simple law of proportionality.              It is very
remarkable that analysis        thus  confirms,   not    in  whole,  but at least
in part, the results to      which  M.  Him    was    led  by the profound me
ditations developed by        him in  what  he  calls  the  second  part of ther
modynamics, the part which might be named philosophic and spe
culative.       Our law (A), provided the fundamental hypothesis of
molecular mechanics be admitted, must evidently be ranged in the
first, the rigorous part. — Comptes Rendus de T Academic des Sciences,

LIU.     On the Mechanical Theory of Croofces's (or Polarization)
   Stress in Gases. By G. JOHNSTONS kSl'ONEY, M.A., F.R.S.,
   fyc., Secretary to the Royal Dublin Society*.
                            Introduction.
           papers  will be found in the first volume of the fifth
TWOseries     of the Philosophical Magazine (March and April
1876), in which I endeavoured to explain the force that Mr.
Crookes had detected within vacuum-chambers, by pointing
out that when heat passes across the residual gas, the mole
cules of the gas that tend respectively towards the heater and
towards the cooler must interpenetrate one another in a greater
degree than they would if the gas were in its ordinary or
unpolarized condition, and that this behaviour will render
the stresses within the gas unequal, causing the stress to be
greatest in the direction in which the augmented interpene-
tration takes place.
   When writing the foregoing papers, and afterwards when
writing a paper on the transfer of heat which accompanies
the phenomenon,      I was under the mistaken impression that
the flow of heat between a heater and cooler in fixed positions,
and at constant temperatures, will become greater if the num
ber of gaseous molecules that intervene is reduced below the
number required for the transfer of heat by the laws of " con-

   dnction"*;        and for this supposed increased flow of heat I
   suggested the name penetration. It has recently been pointed
   out by Dr. Schuster (' Nature/ vol. xvii. p. 143) that experi
   ments have been made which show that the flow of heat dimi
                                                                         "
   nishes instead of increasing when the limit for " conductiou
   is passed. It thus appears that what         I have called penetration
   is always feebler than conduction, and is to be sought, in the
   figures representing De la Provostaye and Desains's experi
   ments, in those portions of the curves which slope steeply
  downwards.          Accordingly my paper on Penetration (Phil.
   Mag. December 1877), and especially that part of it in which
   I  apply the theory to experiment, requires considerable mo
  dification, and some of the statements           I made in my earlier
  papers on Crookes's force need amendment. Although the
  corrections that are required do not affect any material part
  of the theory of unequal stresses within polarized gas, it has
  appeared desirable to resume the subject and present the
 theory freed from the error that has been pointed out. In
  doing this      I  have taken the opportunity of introducing the
 conception       of  the reflecting tube, which greatly facilitates the
 inquiry     into   the mechanical effect of the interpenetration ; and
 I   have also availed myself of the admirable method of treating
 the problem, described by Mr. George F. Fitzgerald in
 '
    Nature,' vol. xvii. p. 200, to obtain a complete expression for
 the stress, and to show that my theory is not at variance
 with results established by Professor Clausius, as has been

      1. If   a drop of water or other volatile liquid is allowed
 to fall into a smooth and sufficiently hot metal dish, it con
 tinues a liquid drop instead of spreading out or flashing off
 into vapour, and it exhibits an appearance of great mobility.
 The drop is then in what has been called the "spheroidal
 state."      Now, when a drop of liquid is so situated a chink
 may be observed between it and the hot surface beneath ; so
 that the drop does not rest directly upon the metal, but is in
reality floating upon a layer of vapour.              We further learn
     * It is known that gases feebly conduct heat by diffusion, and that
the amount of heat which passes in this way between a heater and cooler
is independent of the density of the intervening; gas, provided that the
density of the gas does not fall below a certain limit.      The question
that presented itself was as to what happens below that limit.

 from these observations that after the brief interval of adjust
ment is over the layer of vapour presses upwards and down
wards more than it presses sideways ; for the pressure side
ways must equal the pressure of the atmosphere so soon as the
adjustment is over, otherwise air would still be entering or
leaving the chink, whereas the pressure upwards must exceed
the pressure of the atmosphere by an amount able to support
the drop.     It is my object to explain how this difference of
pressures, this Crookes's pressure as it has been called, comes
into existence.
    2. The thermal conditions of the problem are easily traced,
but need not detain us here.          It is enough to state that
they show the metal dish and drop to be at different tempera
tures, so that they are a heater and cooler on either side of
the layer of vapour.        Experiment further shows that the
heater and cooler may be either one a liquid and one a solid,
as in the case already considered, or both liquids, or both
solid, and that the intervening layer may be either vapour or
permanent gas.       This last important fact has been established
by Mr. Richard Moss in an admirable series of experiments
lately made by him to test the theory of the present communi
cation (see ' Scientific Proceedings of the Royal Dublin So
ciety,' vol. i. p. 89). It is also found to be immaterial whether
the heater or cooler is uppermost, or whether they face one
another sideways.
    Other facts of importance have been elicited by the experi
ments at low tensions, of which the most significant are: — that
when the heater and cooler are maintained at given tempera
tures the Crookes's stress between them may be increased
either by bringing the heater and cooler closer together, or by
attenuating the gas until a certain point is reached which
varies from one gas to another ; and that when that point is
passed, the force decreases and apparently without limit.
    3. We may express these facts in a very convenient form for
our present purpose if the heater and cooler are extensive flat
parallel surfaces at fixed temperatures. Conceive two exactly
similar patches on the heater and cooler directly opposite to
each other, and each occupying a unit of surface, and con
sider that portion of space which lies between these.         Then
the observations show that there is one definite quantity of
the gas to be left in the volume so marked out, if we wish to
produce the strongest Crookes's stress. And, further, by com
paring Mr. Crookes's experiments on the mechanical action
with those of De la Provostaye and Uesains on the flow of
heat, we learn another important fact, viz. that the maximum
stress occurs when the quantity of gas is too little to admit of

the passage of heat under the laws of the conduction of heat
in gases.     Now these facts also follow as consequences from
the theory advanced by the author, and therefore become con
firmations of it.
     4. This theory seeks to account for Crookes's force by show
ing that a layer of gas placed between a heater and cooler is
in a polarized condition of such a kind that the stresses within
the gas are different in different directions.        Gas is polarized
whenever the molecules within a spherical element of volume
are moving towards different quarters with numbers or velo
 cities that are not distributed alike in all directions, the velo
 cities being measured from the centre of mass of these mole
 cules.    This definition excludes the case of mere wind, which
 is  to be regarded as unpolarized gas travelling forward in a
 certain direction ; but it includes the case of gas across which
 heat is making its way, which is the case with which we have
 here to deal.
     5. Let us recur to the simple instance of a heater and cooler
 with extensive flat parallel surfaces maintained at constant
 temperatures, and with gas between them freed from the
action of gravity, and which has had time to adjust itself to
 its position.     Gas so circumstanced will become stationary
in the ordinary sense of the word ; f. e., though in active
molecular motion, it will have no currents like convection-
currents or wind passing through it*.           We have now to show
that the stress across such a layer will be greater than the
stress sideways.
     6. Imagine a unit of suface marked out on either heater
or cooler, and let perpendiculars to the surface be raised from
the boundary of this enclosure. These will trace out a straight
tube extending between the heater and cooler, and closedat
the ends by equal patches of the heater and cooler.           These we
may call    the pistons of the tube.       The molecules  which   strike
the pistons are returned by them, and with altered velocity
 whenever the pistons are at different temperatures ; but mole
cules pass without hindrance through the sides of the tube.
Now it is evident that, if the molecules passing through an
element of the side of the tube are considered, those pass
ing out in a unit of time will be an exact counterpart of
those passing in, in such a sense that the state of the gas
would not be disturbed by making the sides of the tube im-
    » There will be currents close to the boundary of the heater and
cooler ; but these are secondary phenomena caused by, and in no
degree the cause of, Crookes's     stress.  They will not be appreciable
within the layer at any considerable distance from the edge ; and they
may be avoided by giving to the opposed surfaces of the heater and
cooler the form of concentric spheres.

      Mr. G.  J. Stouey on Polarization Stress in Gases.       405
pervious to molecules, provided that they were made at tho
same time perfect reflectors of molecules.       By a reflector of
molecules is to be understood a surface endowed with the pro
perty of throwing off any molecules that impinge upon it with
unabated speed, and at an angle of reflection which lies in the
same plane as the angle of incidence, and is equal to it.     The
reflected molecules will affect the state of the gas within the
tube exactly in the same way as the molecules passing in from
outside had done before.     We have now a portion of gas com
pletely shut up inside a tube with sides that are perfect reflec
tors of molecules, and closed at the ends by pistons that are
patches of the heater and cooler, and which therefore scatter
such molecules as reach them ; and we know that the beha
viour of this gas will be the same as that of the corresponding
portion of the Crookes's layer.      We may call such a tube
a unit reflecting tube.
   7. Let the pistons of such a tube be kept at the tempera
tures Ti and T2, and let gas be introduced into it. After a
brief period of adjustment the gas will become stationary; i. e.,
if a plane forming a cross section of the tube be considered,
the molecular motions are such that the same number of mole
cules pass forwards as backwards through this plane per
second. But they will pass it with unequal average veloci
ties, because the vis viva of those crossing it towards the cooler
must exceed the vis viva of those crossing it towards the heater
by an amount bearing a known ratio to the quantity of heat
advancing.     Hence the gas is polarized, the molecular motions
being swifter when they are directed forward or towards the
cooler, and slower when directed backwards.
   8. Suppose that we begin with dense gas and gradually
exhaust, and let us consider the succession of events that will
arise as the exhaustion proceeds, i. e. when n, the number of
molecules in the unit tube, is progressively diminished.      It is
known that the flow of heat cannot conform to the laws of
" conduction " unless the number of molecules exceeds a cer
tain limit which we may call N, — N depending upon the de
scription of gas that is present, and upon the temperatures T!
and T2 of the pistons which close the unit tube. We must
therefore divide the exhaustion into two periods, one lasting
while the number of molecules in the tube exceeds N, and
the other during the rest of the exhaustion.      Throughout the
first period the flow of heat follows the known laws of con
duction, and therefore remains constant. Hence, during this
part of the exhaustion the polarization of the gas (which may
be measured by — ,     v being the average velocity at any point

of the layer, and           8t>    difference of the velocities
                                  the average
forwards and backwards at that station) is so rapidly on the
increase as quite to compensate in Kpr2So (the expression for
the flow of heat. /> being the density at the station, and     a           K
constant) for the diminishing density.      Daring the second
period, t. e. when the molecules have become fewer than N,
the polarization is still on the increase, but not so rapidly
as before, and at the same time the flow of heat decreases to
zero ; for while p tends to zero as the exhaustion proceeds,
the polarization does not tend to infinity, but to a limit, viz.
 i   —2,                          r,   are the velocities corresponding   to
               where vl and                                                    Ti
and Ts, the temperatures      of the pistons. Now, when gas is po
larized with this kind of polarization within a tube the sides
of which reflect the molecules, we can find limits between
which its thermal and mechanical properties must lie.
    9. Before proceeding to determine these limits, it will be
well to guard ourselves against making mistakes by passing
under review the orders of the several magnitudes with
which we are dealing in this inquiry.               No accurate mea
sures appear yet to have been made of the thickness of the
chinks of air or vapour on which spheroidal drops rest.             But
from approximate measures, some of which were made by Mr.
                                                    I
Fitzgerald and some by myself, think it may be inferred
that this thickness is somewhere about the thickness of a sheet
of paper        e. about a fourth-metre or the tenth of a milli
                 (t.
metre)    when      spheroidal drop of the density of water, at
                       a                                                       a
temperature of 10° C. and           or    millims. in diameter, floats

further know that in this case the Crookes's pressure, as                      it
supports the weight of this drop, must be about the two-
thousandth part of an atmosphere.            These determinations are
very rude but they at all events tell us what kind of magni
                 ;
tude we are dealing with, and therefore suffice for our pre
sent purpose.       They show that we shall not be far wrong in
assuming definitively that the phenomenon presented by ex

any width we please. Let us take a width equal to the diameter
of the smallest object that can be seen with a microscope,
which is about 2'5 seventh-metres, or the 100,000th part
of an inch.      We have now to compare the dimensions of
this tube with the number and motions of the molecules in
cluded within it. The number of molecules in a cubic milli
metre of atmospheric air is about a unit-eighteen (10i8). (See
Phil. Mag. August 1868.) Whence the average interval be
tween them is about a ninth-metre.           This is the 100,000th
part of the length of our tiny tube and the 250th part of its
breadth.     Hence the tube will contain a vast number of mole
cules, some such number as five thousand millions.           Again,

it   is,
      for    vast number of molecules and for much jostling

amongst    them.    The temperatures with which we are dealing
are such that the average velocity with which the molecules
of air dash about may be taken as 500 metres per second;
and the molecules meet with so many encounters, that the di
rection of the path of each         changed somewhere about
                                             is                            a
unuVten of times (10,000,000,000) every second.            To com
plete the picture, we must remember that each molecule            in  is
a state of vigorous internal motion as well as travelling about
among its fellows, and that when an encounter takes place,
the energy which passes from one molecule to another                       is
employed in changing both those kinds of motion, and pos
sibly (but not probably) another part becomes potential
energy, t. e. energy expended in altering the configuration of
the parts of the molecule, or the position of its parts with re
ference to the aether. The motions which go on within the
molecules are what give rise to the linear spectra of gases, and
are therefore those motions of the gas that act on the aether,
and are in turn partly controlled by it*. They are recurring

   into harmonics like the vibrations of a string, or else into
   quasi-harmonics not to be distinguished from harmonics by
   observation (see Donkin's 'Acoustics,' § 194), like the trans
   verse vibrations of an elastic rod — probably the former.              On
   the more probable supposition that they are true harmonics,
   the periodic times have been determined with great precision
   in some cases, notably in the cases of a motion within the
   molecules of hydrogen, which gives rise to three of its spec
   tral lines, and a motion within the molecules of chlorochromic
   anhydride, which gives rise to 105 of its spectral lines. In
   hydrogen the motion is repeated as often as 2,280,000,000,000
   times each second in every molecule, and in the vapour of
   chlorochromic anhydride rather more than 800,000,000,000
   times*.      Such are the periodic times on the supposition that
  ihe motions are resolvable into true harmonics ; and whether
   the fact be that the components of the motions are harmonics
  or quasi-harmonics, their periodic times are at all events quan
  tities of this order. The general presumption, therefore, is
  that the periodic times within the molecules of other gases are
  also quantities of this order.        But it is not necessary for our
  present purpose       to establish this.   The only circumstance re
  lating to these inner motions with which we are here directly
  concerned is that the energy which is transferred from mole
 cule to molecule is employed partly in altering the velocities
 with which the molecules travel about, and partly in altering
 these internal motions and (perhaps) collocations, and that
 the proportion of the energy which is employed in the former
 way bears on the average a numerical ratio to the whole energy
 transferred which can be determined experimentally (see Max
 well's ' Theory of Heat,' p. 299) and is denoted in the sequel
 **    10. We now proceed to determine limits between which
the thermal and mechanical properties of the gas must lie.

from each piston are equal, we have the further equation

while the stress along the tube would be

which accordingly exceeds the transverse stress by
                    K=pfun + p"um                                          (7)
    This,    therefore, would be the Crookes's stress in the case
supposed.         U is a very large quantity, since u, and u" would
be large if the streams could penetrate one another without
obstruction.        The flow of heat, which we will designate by
the symbol G, would also be very large in the case supposed.
An expression for it can be easily found, but is not required
1'or our present purpose.
    11. The other limit is one that really occurs.                  It arises
when the molecules coming up to either piston and those re
tiring from it form complementary parts, such that their co
existence in the same space constitutes stationary unpolarized
gas.     This happens only when the two pistons are at the same
temperature.         In this case it is manifest that no heat is con
veyed by the gas, and that the gas exerts the same pressure
in all directions.       In symbolical language,
                                    G=0,
                                    K =0,
G being,       as before, the symbol for the flow of heat, and K for
the Crookes's stress.         This case may be described as one in
which the streams described in the last section experience such
effectual opposition from each other that the speed with which
they advance is zero.           For it is evident that the gas at any
station within the tube may, without any change of its pro
perties, be described as consisting of two equal portions of
stationary unpolarized gas coexisting in the same spaco.
    12. In all other cases the pistons that close the ends of the
unit tube are at different temperatures, and the gas between
any two cross sections of the tube is polarized.               Let us con
sider a slice between two such sections, which are sufficiently
close to entitle us to regard the included gas as being through
out in nearly the same state.           The actual condition of the gas
                         "
   * The    term " stress is here applied to the pressure within the gas in
any direction, viewed in conj unction with the equal pressure in the opposite
direction.    It is what Clausius has called " the positive momentum,"
meaning    thereby  the sum of the components of the momenta of the mole
cules resolved in a given direction, and all estimated as positive, whether
of molecules that move forward or backward.

      Mr. G.     J.   Stoney on Polarization Stress in Gases.      411
within the slice may evidently be conceived of as arising from
the coexistence of two streams travelling in opposite directions
along the tube, and each consisting of gas which is less pola
rized      e. which deviates less from the condition of ordinary
          (i.
gas) than the gas that results from their coexistence.             Each
stream      exposed within the slice to the mutual jostling of its
           is
own molecules and     ;         italso attacked by molecules of the
                                     is
other stream. The mutual jostling of its own molecules tends,
as explained in section 10, both to maintain the onward velo
city of the stream and to reduce the gas of which the stream
consists still more towards the condition of unpolarized gas.
These encounters then, taken by themselves, tend to bring
about the state of the gas described in section 10. But the
interference of the two streams with one another counteracts
this.    This interference modifies the effect of the encounters
within the streams, but                 incompetent to annul it; for
                                         it   is
 the two streams do not by their mere coexistence constitute
 stationary unpolarized gas, and hence they would need time
 before they could by their action upon one another reduce the
 gas to this condition.        It             is,
                                        however, plain that whatever
 action they exert          step towards bringing about this condi
                           is   a
 tion for the gas would become depolarized
      ;                                                 if the cross sec
 tions which bound the slice could be rendered impervious both
 to energy and molecules, so as to leave the two streams time
 to act fully on one another.          In reality, however, sufficient
 time     not allowed to them, because the streams pass one ano
          is
 ther, and the struggle         continually renewed within the slice
                                    is
 by fresh portions of the streams which come up in the same
 state as those that had been obliged to pass on.            These fresh
 portions keep    in  the same    state  because    sufficient
                                                    a           supply of
 swift molecules         without intermission being thrown back
                          is
 along the tube from one end by the heater, and              correspond
                                                             a
 ing supply     of  slow   molecules     from   the  other   end  by the
 cooler.
     13. The two streams, however, though not annulled, are
 different from what they would have been               ifthey had been
  without influence upon one another. They do not consist of
  the same molecules from one instant to another; for there           is
  such a perpetual shifting of molecules between them, owing
  to the vast number of encounters that take place, that no one
  molecule     likely to remain long in one stream.
                is                                           Again, after
  an encounter between molecules of the two streams, both of
  the colliding molecules will sometimes join the same stream            ;
  and it will most frequently happen that the stream so joined
 is  the hotter and swifter stream.         Hence the stream from the
  heater to the cooler receives an accession to the number of its

412     Mr. G.   J. Stoney on Polarization Stress in Gases-
molecules as it travels forward, while the reverse effect is pro
duced upon the stream making its way in the opposite direc
tion.   On both accounts there will be gradients of density
and temperature along the tube between the heater and cooler.
Again, every encounter between molecules of the two streams
diminishes the momentum of one or both streams ; but, as we
have seen, the effect so produced does not go the length of
reducing the streams to rest.
   14. Hence we must bear in mind the gradients of tempera
ture and density along the two streams, and the continual
fluctuation of the molecules that are to be referred to them, if
we want to regard the condition of the gas throughout the
whole length of the tube as arising out of the coexistence of
two streams of gas less polarized than itself.     But with these
precautions the hypothesis may be made ; and accordingly the
condition of the gas at every cross section of the tube is inter
mediate between a structure represented by the coexistence of the
two streams of unpolarized gas travelling simultaneously in op
posite directions, which the encounters within each stream tend
to develop, and the condition of stationary unpolarized gas,
towards which the mutual interference of the two streams mo
difies the structure.    Hence there is some polarization stress
and some flow of heat all along the tube, though of less amount
than in the case considered in section 10. We may still em
ploy equation (7) as the expression for the polarization stress,
if we use for p' and p" the densities of the streams at some
particular cross section of the tube, and if u, and u" are modi
fied into what they become as the interference of the two
streams with one another is increased.        It is not necessary
to ascertain what this modification will be : it is enough for
 our purpose to know that u' and u" will be some functions of
 V— V" (where V'3 and V"3 are the averages of the cubes of
 the velocities of the molecules that pass forwards and back
wards respectively through the cross section), and that they
 will be proportional to this quantity when all three are small.
    15. We may base upon this circumstance an investigation
into the laws of the phenomenon when the difference between
 the temperatures of the heater and cooler is small compared
 with their absolute temperatures. This case is of importance
 because it is that which most frequently occurs, and is the
 only one in reference to which accurate experiments have
 been made.     In this case p' and p" will each be nearly $p,
 using  p for the  density of the gas at the position in lie tube
 which we are considering ; and V— V", being small, may be
 appropriately represented by SV. Then, remembering that M'
 and u" are proportional to 8V, we obtain from equation (7)

formulae,    let us plot down on a diagram the value of *, the
polarization stress, for various tensions of gas between a heater
and cooler at constant temperatures and at a fixed distance
asunder.
   Let the abscissas of the figure represent the tensions of the
gas. Then the curve Obcd, the ordinates of which represent
the flow of heat, is known.     The part representing conduction
is the parallel line c d; and 01 c represents the outflow of heat
by that modified conduction which may be called penetration,
which occurs when the exhaustion has proceeded so far that
the number of molecules in a unit tube is less than N (see

      Mr. G.    J.  Stoney on Polarization Stress in Gates.      41o
above, section 8).        The curve Qbcd is therefore known ; and
if by equation (B) we plot down from it the values of K (the
polarization stress), we find them approximately represented by
the ordinates of a curve of the form Oace, the portion to the
right of c being coincident with an equilateral hyperbola,
while to the left of c the ordinates fall short of the hyperbola,
rising to a maximum and then falling off to zero. The posi
tion of this maximum cannot be obtained with certainty,
because equation (B) is less to be depended on at very low
tensions. Bearing this in mind, the accordance of the theoretic
values with those determined experimentally by Mr. Crookes
and Mr. Moss is satisfactory.
    17. From equation (B) we may obtain another useful for
mula which expresses the approximate law according to which
 polarization stress depends upon the interval between heater
and cooler, whenever this interval exceeds the limit determined
by the condition that there shall be a sufficient number of mo
lecules in the unit tube to allow heat to pass by conduction.
   In this case we know the equation of the gradient of tem
perature (see Clausius' equation (54), Phil. Mag. vol. xxiii.
p. 527), and that it is approximately represented by a straight
                                       AT
line when, as we have assumed,         -~- is small, using AT for the
difference between the temperatures of the heater and cooler.
Hence, and from Clausius' equation (56), it appears that
                                G2    (AT)2 '
                                   Q^

using    X   for the     distance between     the heater and   cooler.
Introducing this value into equation (B), we find
a result which agrees satisfactorily with Mr. Moss's experi
ments.
   18.   If we use X<> for that interval between heater and cooler
which would make the number of molecules in the unit tube
equal to N, and if we use KO for the corresponding value of the
Crookes's stress, then equation (C), and the obvious equation
X0   <x

            furnish us with the following: —

Now equation (C) enables us to plot down a part of the curve
representing the relation between * and X when AT and P
are kept constant ; and although equation (C) cannot be relied
upon when      X   is less than X0, it is nevertheless evident that

416          Mr. G.   J.   Stoney on Polarization Stress in Gut*t.
the shape of the remainder of the curve must be one which is
independent of the particular value of P which we have used.
Hence, if * is the maximum value of * in that curve, it follows
that * and *0 must remain proportional to one another when
P is changed. Hence equation (10) furnishes
                                *ocP.(AT)3   .......

stress which can be elicited between a given heater and cooler
by varying the distance between them will, if the tension of
the gas is altered, change in the same ratio as that tension,
and that it will occur at intervals between heater and cooler
which vary inversely as that tension. This fully accounts for
the powerful Crookes's force which presents itself in experi
ments at ordinary atmospheric tensions as compared with the
feeble force exhibited in radiometers.      It accounts also for
the very short  interval at which the heater  and cooler must be
placed when the gas is dense.

between the two stresses — in other words, a polarization stress.
   20. Clausius (loc. cit.) gives the following general expres
sion for the normal stress —
where   Iis the coefficient expressing the proportion of mole
cules travelling in the directions which make an angle with
the normal or axis of x of which the cosine is /*, and where
V* is the mean of the squares of their velocities.

   These are the most general expressions for the stresses in
three rectangular directions within gas polarized in any way                                                   ;
and they will be the only stresses between portions of the gas
separated by planes parallel to the planes yz, zx, xy,   the axes                                   if
are so chosen that there are no moments round them arising
from the molecular encounters*.
   21. This condition    easily secured in the case which we are
                                               is
investigating,  viz. when  heat     making its way between a     is
heater and cooler that are parallel to one another, and of large
extent compared with the interval between them, since the
polarization of the intervening gas will evidently be disposed
symmetrically round the direction in which the heat        travel                                    is
ling.  Hence, taking this direction as our axis of x, there can
be no moments round this axis, or round any axis at right
angles to it. The stresses (E), therefore, are the only ones to
be taken into account.   Moreover we can integrate equations
                  since IV2          <f>,

dependent of the direction, and may therefore be put outside the integrals.
In this case all three equations concur in giving the well-known expres
sion for the stress in unpolarized gas, viz.   pV'.                   §

   This,     then, is the complete matli&natical expression for

   22. Clausing, in investigating the diffusion of heat across
the layer of gas, makes the assumption (Phil. Mag. vol. xxiii.
pp. 425 and 524) that the numbers and velocities of the mole
cules   " emitted " by a thin stratum of the gas       e. that have
                                                             (i.
passed   out of the stratum   after  having  encountered  other mo
lecules within    it)
                    may  be                          "
                             adequately represented by assuming
at first motions taking place equally in all directions, and then
supposing    asmall additional component velocity in the direc
tion of positive x to be imparted to all the molecules."          In
other words,     it  assumed that the motions of these molecules
                      is
may be represented by radii vectores from a slightly excentric
origin to points equally distributed over the surface of a sphere.
It will be instructive to trace the consequences of this hypo
thesis, both because      what
                           of    itwill do and what    will not do.

which it rests is adequate as regards the conduction of heat,
but is insufficient for a quantitative investigation of the stress,
as  I will now proceed to show.

  The general formulae for the conduction of heat and for the
polarization stress arc the following —

that we can expand IV2 and IV3 in series of spherical harmo
nics of the same simple type. Doing this,
                                      IV3 =
the g'a and £'s representing spherical harmonics.  Whence,
and from the fundamental property of spherical harmonics,
Hence <7!     the only term of the first series that produces any

conduction of heat, and        the only term of the second series
                                         kt   is
that produces any polarization stress.
   Let us suppose radii drawn from point in all directions, of

lengths proportional to the values of IV2 in those directions.

Next,  A0 + ki may
                     be plotted down by shifting the centre of
this sphere through the small distance B towards positive JF,
and by then very slightly distorting the form of the sphere.
Again, to plot down k0 + k3, we should elongate the sphere in
the direction of the axis x by an amount equal to 4C, and nar
row it equatorially by an amount equal to 2C, without shifting
its centre. Finally, k0 + ki + k2 would be represented by radii
drawn to the surface of this last solid, after it had been slightly
distorted and removed through the distance B towards the
cooler. Through all these mutations the mean value of the
radii drawn from the origin remains unaltered*.
   Comparing these figures with expansion (12), which is the
value for IV3 furnished by Clausius' hypothesis, we fmd that
the form and position of the solid which results from plotting
it down are such that (owing to the term containing /*) there
is that separation between the origin of radii and the centre of
figure which gives a sufficient value to the function k^, but
that (the coefficient of     containing only very small quanti

                             is    in the way which would allow
the function       to attain any considerable value.

the slight distortion of figure before mentioned, which give rise
to very smallf terms of the form ki, k3, &c.

   This almost total absence of the elongated form arises from
Clausius' fundamental hypothesis, that the motions of the
molecules emitted by a stratum may be represented by radii
drawn to a sphere from an excentric point ; whereas it appears
from the discussion in the earlier part of the present memoir
that the encounters that take place within each of the two
streams into which the gas may be divided, give to the surface
to which the radii are to be drawn an elongated form.        This
omission from Clausius' hypothesis does not sensibly affect
the spherical harmonics of the first order, and accordingly his
hypothesis is adequate as regards the flow of heat, which de
pends exclusively on one of these ; but it renders the hypo
thesis an insufficient one as regards polarization stress, or any
other phenomenon which depends               on spherical harmonica    of
the second order.

AScounted
         the
      magnetic properties
          for by assuming the existence              of a magnet in its
interior, it is quite evident that the preceding consideration can
only indicate the general course of the phenomena in question.
We will now rapidly examine whether the results of that con
sideration are conformable to those given by observation.
   Atmospheric electricity has long been the object of repeated
investigations.     These have been so numerous that to give an
two square centimetres at the distance of a fourth-metre asunder and kept
at temperatures that differ by 10° C.  To turn this into kinetic measure
we must multiply by 41600 x 1000000 ; so that G would amount to about
1144000 in G.C.S. kinetic measure       e. in hyper-fifth-grammetres
                                       (t.                            per
second).  Again, we may take as rough approximations,

Introducing these values into equation (18), we find approximately,

account of them would require too much space ; and it is be
sides the less necessary as we already possess a statement,
followed by a very well executed critical discussion, of those
observations*.        Some physicists have essayed to explain the
results obtained     by observation by assuming that the air itself
is electropositive in its normal state ; while others have thought
that the surface of the earth is electronegative, and that it pro
duces by induction the electrical phenomena observed in the
atmosphere.       Opinions have been much divided upon the true
cause of the electric state of the air or of that of the earth's
surface. Some have assumed that evaporation from the sea,
lakes, and the wet surface of the ground renders the atmo
sphere electropositive and the earth electronegative ; others,
on the contrary, that the distribution of electricity has its effi
cient cause in vegetation, in the putrefaction of organic mat
ters at the surface of the earth, in the friction of the air against
the ground or the water, or in the condensation and rarefac
tion of the air, &c.        More exact researches having shown -that
none of these opinions can be correct, the phenomenon has
been attributed to a purely cosmic cause, having its seat in the
empty space surround ing the earth, or in other celestial bodies,
chiefly the sun. In a word, up to this hour no one has suc
ceeded, either in consequence of observations,               or by theoretic
considerations,     in assigning      a valid  and   trustworthy cause for
the electric phenomena of the terrestrial atmosphere.                   From
the above-mentioned observations, however, it appears that the
atmosphere, under normal conditions, can be regarded as elec
tropositive in its lower strata (accessible to observation), that
the amount of electricity increases with the height above the
earth's surface, and that the amount is subject to a diurnal
and an annual variation.
    From the preceding exposition of the cause of unipolar in
duction it follows that the atmosphere must be electropositive,
and the earth electronegative.             The electric molecules at and
beneath the earth's suri'ace are directed by the force of terres
trial unipolar induction into the atmosphere, where they accu
mulate until they attain a certain density, dependent on the
greater or less conductivity of the strata of air. It is only
 successively that, impelled by the same force, they arrive in
 the upper strata of the atmosphere, endowed with a high de
 gree of condnctivilv, but certainly inferior to that of the metals.
 At the same time that the electric molecules rise above the sur
 face of the earth, they are carried, in both hemispheres, from
 the lower into the higher latitudes, where the electric density

                       and   the Aurora boreali*.                     425
in consequence perpetually goes on increasing.                The forces
tending     to conduct  the  electric   molecules   in  the vertical  and
horizontal directions are very feeble above and around the
magnetic poles ; and consequently the electric density of the
atmosphere      attains a maximum at a certain distance from
those poles.      As we have seen, this maximum of electric den
sity forms a zone enclosing, in the northern hemisphere, both
the magnetic and the astronomic pole ; and doubtless it is the
same in the southern hemisphere.             The magnetic forces act
always     with equal intensity,    as  the relatively slight variations
 undergone by the terrestrial magnet from one period to another
can be neglected.       If, then, the conductivity of the air were
equally invariable, the electrical tension of the lower strata of
 the atmosphere would remain always the same ; but as this
condition is by no means fulfilled, that tension must necessa
 rily vary. It is evident that the electric tension at a given
 point near the surface of the earth does not depend solely on
 the conductivity of the air around that point, but also on that
 of the higher strata, up to the height where the conductivity
 becomes sufficiently good in consequence of the rarefaction of
 the air.     Suppose, for example, that a fog envelops the terres
 trial surface, and that above the fog is a stratum of dry air
 impenetrable to electricity ; the force of magnetic induction,
  still active, will then direct the electric molecules from the
  earth into the fog, which will soon show itself electropositive,
  as observations have proved.         If, on the contrary, the fog ex
  tended up to the higher, conductive strata of the air, doubtless
  the electric charge of the lower strata would disappear sud
  denly.     From this we see how hazardous it is to attribute the
  greater or less electric charge of the air at a given place to the
  greater or less humidity of the air observed at the same place,
  in my opinion it is highly probable that the periodic varia
  tions, both the diurnal anJ the annual, in the electric state of
  the lower strata of the air have their cause in the variations of
  the conductivity of the atmosphere ; but certainly it is not
  enough to take into consideration only those variations which
  happen upon the spot where the observations of atmospheric
  electricity are made.
      The electric condition of the air in the polar regions is espe
   cially interesting.     Scoresby, in spite of reiterated trials,
   found it impossible to discover in those regions the slightest
   trace of electricity in the air*.      The French expedition of the
   corvet ' La Recherche,' which passed the winter of 1838-39
   at Bossekop in the Altenljord (about 70° N. lat.), applied
   themselves repeatedly to the examination of the electricity of

426          Prof. E. Edlund on Atmospheric Electricity
the air.       MM. Lottin and Bravais, who         made     during the
summer experiments of this kind in lower latitudes, obtained
positive deflections upon a straw electroscope when it was
placed in metallic connexion with arrows shot into the air.
Now these deflections ceased to be obtained as soon as the
latitude of the North Cape was reached.            In February and
March, however, they several times succeeded in detecting
feeble traces of positive electricity in the air on putting the
electroscope   in connexion with kites which they raised to a
considerable height*. During the Swedish expedition to
 Spitzbergen in 1868, M. Lemstrom tried in vain to discover
traces of electricity in the air (80° N. lat.)f.       M. Wijkander
had better   luck  in  the  expedition   of 1872-73  to the same re
gions.    Furnished with a more sensitive apparatus than those
employed by his predecessors, in the autumn of 1872 he con
tinually obtained proofs of positive electricity in the air.
 During the winter, from the middle of January to near the
end of May, on the other hand, the electricity shown was
sometimes positive, sometimes negative.          In fact he obtained
 20 positive and about an equal number of negative observa
 tions. The observations made in the course of the spring,
 when the temperature approached zero, gave the same results
as the summer observations — namely, slight traces of positive
electricity.   It           is,
                        moreover, a remarkable fact that the air
was generally positive during the winter days when aurorae
boreales appeared, but on other occasions most frequently ne
gative.    Respecting this the following remark        ismade by M.
Wijkander,    which    in  my opinion  is  well worthy  of considera
tion  —
      :  "All the observations which were made agree in this,
that, in the latitudes in question, at the highest temperatures
the air conducts electricity with great facility— circumstance
                                                      a
to which have been attributed the absence of thunder and the
presence of the aurora borealis.         Divers physicists have be
lieved that this may be assumed to depend on the humidity of
the air in those regions       but that other causes also contribute
                                  ;

    These observations prove indubitably that the cause to which

very feeble.    It cannot, in my opinion, be attributed to the

were the case, fog in lower latitudes ought only to betray in
significant traces of electricity, since the conductivity of fog
is surely as good as that of the air of the polar regions under
ordinary circumstances. Now we know that, notwithstanding
its high conductivity, fog is very strongly electropositive.
   The real cause of the above-mentioned results of observa
tion  is, in my opinion, that the vertical component of the force
of induction, or, in other terms, the force tending to direct
the aether (electropositive fluid) from the earth to the air,                   is
very insignificant.       The electropositive charge of the air must
therefore be feeble, and sometimes so slight that the air be
comes negative by communication with the earth, as                     shown
                                                                      is
by   M. Wijkander's observations.              The earth itself, on the
contrary, must always be electronegative in those regions.
If  no exterior force acted upon the electric fluid, the earth
and the atmosphere would be in the neutral state                  ;  but as     a
portion of the electropositive fluid which belonged to the earth
has been conveyed into the atmosphere in consequence of the
action of the induction-force, the earth itself must be electro
negative. The earth being a good conductor of electricity,
ana at the same time constituting             a    spheroid, its negative
electricity must be distributed in a pretty equal fashion at its
surface ;    consequently the terrestrial surface must likewise
show itself electronegative in the polar regions, although the
vertical component of the force of induction                 is  there very
feeble.     With the exception of some rare occasions when                      it
was difficult or impossible for him to detect traces of electri
city, M. Wijkander also found that the earth was constantly
electronegative.       It follows also from the proposed theory that
the conductivity of the air in the polar regions should, as M.
Wijkander describes, appear greater than at lower latitudes
for the same temperature and with the same humidity. If                         a
conducting body placed in the atmosphere                is    charged with
electricity,   evidently  it   must   be  influenced    by   the  vicinity of
an electronegative body so large as the earth.             If   the conduc
tive body   is   charged with positive electricity, this electricity
is  attracted downward by the negative earth           ;   if  the charge       is
negative,    the  reverse   takes  place,  for  the  same   reasons.     Con
sequently, in both cases       the  loss of  the   electricity  in  the air     is
accelerated by the negative earth being in the vicinity of the
charged body. Now the force of induction of the earth acts
upon the electricity of the body in the opposite direction.                     If
 the body   is  electropositive, that force tends to direct the elec
tricity of the body from below upwards, and vice versa                    the
                                                                           if
 body is   electronegative.      Therefore the earth's induction-force
tends to diminish the influence of iho earth's electricity upon

428           Prof. E. Edlund on Atmospheric Electricity
the charge of the body.         In the regions of the terrestrial sur
face where the force of induction is either zero or very little,
the body will in consequence            more readily lose its electric
charge   than  in  the  localities   where   that force is greater ; the
conductivity    of  the  moist   air  will therefore  appear greater in
the polar regions than at lower latitudes.           The composition of
pure air      is,
              without any doubt, the same in the frigid as in the
temperate zone        at the same temperature and under the same
                        ;

cover any reason for which its electric conductivity should be
different.    It therefore, to exterior causes that we must at
                        is,
tribute the rapid loss of the charge of electrified bodies in the
polar regions and the exterior causes are probably those which
                    ;
have just been indicated.
   According to the proposed theory                self evident, without
                                                           it   is
any other explanation, that the air would, as was proved by
the observations      of M. Wijkander, exhibit traces of positive
electricity on the days distinguished by intense aurorae
 boreales.
   The cause just given for the electric state of the atmosphere
is  probably the only one which acts uninterruptedly every
 where   ; but no doubt there exist others, the action of which,
connected with certain localities,           of more accidental cha
                                                      is     a
 racter. To these belong, for instance, the development of
electricity described by M. K.-A. Holmgren, who found that,
on the division of a liquid into drops, an electromotive force
arises at the point itself where the division   effected      To          is             *.
the same force     probably due; the negative electricity of the
                         is
fine drizzle carried away by the air in cascades or powerful
cataracts.   As to evaporation, vegetation, the friction of the
molecules of the air against one another or against the surface
of the earth, as well as several other phenomena in which some
have been willing to trace the cause of the electricity of the
air, they have assuredly no sensible influence upon the pheno
menon in question          Of course, however,

t    Of all those so-called causes of the electricity of the air, and of the aurora
borealis, evaporation         is,
                            without doubt, that which has attracted most
notice  ; but manifold reasons may be cited for the opinion that evapora
tion has nothing to do with this phenomenon.            We may observe, in the
first pluce, that no one has ever succeeded in definitively proving, by ex
periments made in the laboratory, that evaporation produces electncity.

    As was said above (p. 364), the electropositive fluid (the
aether) flows from the upper strata of the atmosphere to the
earth in the direction of the dipping-needle.                   The vertical
component       of the  induction-force     in  general    diminishes    as we
remove from the equator towards the pole, while the density
of the electric fluid present in the atmosphere increases with
the latitude.       On arriving near enough to the pole for that
component       and  the electric resistance of the air to be no longer
capable of opposing a sufficient obstacle, the positive fluid
flows down into the electronegative earth. The localities where
this takes place form a continuous zone surrounding, in the
northern hemisphere, both the magnetic and the astronomic
pole, and descending in America to lower latitudes than in the
Old World.         In my opinion, to the passage of these currents
through     the  rarefied   air we must ascribe the production of the
aurora borealis*.
greater in the former season than in the latter. Now, as every one knows,
what takes place is precisely the contrarv.      The positive electricity pro
duced by evaporation, chiefly in the torrid zone, would rise into the at
mosphere with the ascending aqueous vapour, would then be conducted
by the upper currents of air (the counter-trades) towards higher latitudes,
where it would form the aurora borealis by its descent to the earth. But
 these currents are at an insignificant height from the ground in compa
rison with that of the aurora boreales ; and, besides, they descend to the
surface of the earth long before arriving at the regions marked bv the
principal frequency of these phenomena.        Although complete confidence
cannot be accorded to the measurements of the altitude of the aurora
borealis, we are certain that it is sometimes very considerable.      Some de
terminations made during the above-mentioned          French expedition indi
cate a height of 160 kilometres ; and the height has been found still
greater on other occasions.       (At the highest latitudes, however, the
aurora borealis may from time to time appear at a short distance from the
terrestrial surface, as is proved by the observations of Farquharson,
 Wrangel, Parry, Lemstrom, and several other arctic voyagers.)            At so
 great an elevation the extremely rarefied air is assuredly not troubled by
 winds ; and it is difficult to conceive how that rarefied air could become
 electric through the evaporation produced in the equatorial regions.        If
 there existed no special force to raise the electropositive fluid into the at
 mosphere, this fluid must immediately descend to the earth, and the atmo
sphere would certainly exhibit no traces of electricity.
    *
       On the passage of electric currents through the air M. Lemstrora
 has made some experiments which throw much light upon the pheno
 menon in question (Archives det Sciences Phys. et Nat. t. liv. pp. 72,
 162).    Witn the aid of a Holtz machine he kept at a determined electric
 charge a metal knob furnished with some metallic points.            With this
 view the knob was connected by a conducting wire to one of the poles of
 the machine, while the other pole was in communication with the earth.

    It is evident, therefore, that aurorae boreales must become
more numerous in -proportion as we come nearer to this ring
from the south, and that their greatest frequency will be under
this ring itself, while they commence to decrease again in
number and in brightness at still higher latitudes.             Southward
of the ring, the observer sees the aurora in the north ; if he is
 beneath it, the aurora occupies, when seen under favourable
circumstances, the greater part of the sky ; and, lastly, if he
is northward of the ring, the aurora appears on the south.
It can hardly be admitted that this ring occupies an absolutely
fixed position in the atmosphere ; rather is it probable that on
one occasion it is situated more to the south or more to the
north than on another — a circumstance which may depend on
the modifications of the electric conductivity of the terrestrial
atmosphere.        If, then, the place of the observer is at a point
of  the  earth's   surface    over which the ring is usually situated,
he may see the aurora borealis sometimes to the north, some
times to the south.         If  this ring formed a true circle with the
magnetic pole       for its  centre,  if the intensity of the descending
current were the same at every point, and consequently pro
duced everywhere the same intensity of light, an observer on
the earth to the south of the ring would necessarily see the
crown of the boreal arc in the plane passing through the place
of observation, the centre of the earth, and the magnetic pole.
Now, if the declination-needle placed itself entirely in this
plane, one would, in consequence, always perceive the summit
of the boreal arc in the plane of terrestrial magnetic declina
tion.     But the ring in question does not form a perfect circle,
nor can we assume that the descending currents possess every
where the same luminous intensity.                 Besides, the plane in
At  a certain distance from the knob some Geissler tubes were fixed to an
insulated stage permitting them to be brought near to or moved away
from the knob. The tubes were, as usual, furnished at their extremities
with thin platinum wires. The posterior extremities were connected with
the earth by a conducting wire, while the anterior extremities, or those
turned towards the knob, were insulated in the air.      Although there wtfl
no metallic communication between the tubes and the knob, they never
theless commenced to be luminous as soon as the machine was put in mo
tion, and that even when the distance between the tubes and the knob
rose to 2 metres.    The current which produced the luminous appearance
must therefore have traversed a length of 2 metres through a stratum of
air of ordinary density.     It was natural that no luminosity was produced
in this layer of dense air. These experiments appear to me to have much
analogy with the phenomena produced on a grand scale at the formation
of the aurora borealis in the terrestrial atmosphere : the electric currents
coming from the upper strata descend into the earth without producing
luminous phenomena in the lowest strata of the atmosphere.

                       and the Aurora borealis.                431
question indicates only approximately the direction of the
declination-needle.      From theory, then, it follows that the
direction of the declination-needle must indicate generally and
approximately the summit of the boreal arc, though we are not
authorized to maintain that the two must entirely coincide
with one another.
     In the localities on the terrestrial surface situated beneath
the ring of maximum electric density the electricity descends
in the direction indicated by the dipping-needle of the locality;
for, as we have demonstrated above (p. 364), the action of the
inductive force of the earth is equal to zero in that direction.
     The descending currents cannot be compelled to deviate
 from the above-mentioned direction, unless, in consequence of
 an accidental meteorological state of the atmosphere, the elec
 trical resistance of the air is greater in that direction than in
 another, in which case the intensity of the descending current
 will be most considerable in the direction of least resistance.
 As a case of this kind may easily occur, we are authorized to
 maintain, on the ground of the theory, only that the descend
 ing currents must be in general parallel to the dipping-needle.
  Now the current betrays its path through the air by a line of
  light.   If  those luminous lines parallel to one another be
  viewed from the surface of the earth, they will appear to con
  verge to a point, by the same laws of perspective to which is
  due the visual convergence of the rows of trees of a long
  avenue.     As to the point, it will be found in the direction
  which the dipping-needle at the place of observation indicates
  in the sky. To this optical phenomenon is due the auroral
  crown which appears in complete aurorae boreales.        The cur
  rents in question are formed as soon as the difference of elec
  tric tension between the atmosphere and the earth is great
  enough to surmount the obstacle presented by the resistance
  of the air. Now, the earth being a good conductor of elec
  tricity, and constituting a sphere, its negative charge must be
  nearly the same everywhere.       Doubtless no one will maintain
  that the positive charge of the air in the southern hemisphere
  is constantly equal to the same charge in the northern hemi
   sphere.   The forces which tend to render the air electropositive
   and the earth electronegative are equal in the two hemispheres;
   but the result of the activity of those forces depends in part
   on the meteorological state of the air, which may be different
   for each hemisphere. Nevertheless, as we have said, there
   cannot be any great difference in the negative charge of the
   earth ; and consequently one at least of the causes on which
   the discharge depends is common to both hemispheres. There
   fore nothing very extraordinary can be found in tho fact that     (

432        Prof. E. Edluud on Atmospheric Electricity
auroras are often simultaneous in the northern and the south
ern hemisphere.
   If we compare the theoretic deductions above formulated
with the results of observation, we shall find that there exists
a satisfactory accordance between them.
   According to Loomis, in North America, under the meridian
of Washington and at the 40th parallel, 10 auroras per year
are seen ; under the 42nd parallel the number amounts to 20 ;
and near the 45th the number is 40.             In the latitude of 50°,
the number of aurorae boreales yearly is stated at 80 ; and
between this latitude and that of 62° the aurora appears nearly
every night.       Between the last two latitudes the aurora
borealis appeared quite as often to the south as to the north.
Here, then, is situated the zone, properly so called, of the
aurorae boreales, of which about 56                 may be considered
the mean latitude.         To the north of 62° the auroras appear
almost exclusively on the south side, and they diminish in
number and brightness as we advance northward.                  At 67° lat.
their number has fallen to 20, and is only 10 in the vicinity of
78°.    The same fact presents itself at the meridian of St. Pe
tersburg ; but here the zone of the auroras is situated much
more northward than in America : it is only between the 66th
and 75th degrees of north latitude that the annual number of
aurora? boreales is stated at 80*.
   A multitude of measurements upon the position of the auroral
arc were made at Bossekop in the winter of 1838-39, by the
French Expedition to Spitzbergen and Norway.                   The result
of  more   than   200  measurements was, that the crown of the
arc was situated 10° west of the magnetic meridian.                  Arge-
lander had arrived at results nearly the same by his observa
tions made at Abo, in Finland. In consequence of accidental
circumstances, the crown of the auroral arc appeared several
times to the east of the magnetic meridian.            The position indi
cated being the mean of all the observations, is cleared of acci
dental perturbations'!".       The fact that the crown of the auroral
arc must in those regions appear, on the average, to the west
of the magnetic meridian flows directly from the theory, if we
take into consideration the geographical situation and the mag
netic declination of the locality, as well as the form and situa
tion of the annular space of the maximum of electric density.
It is easy, in the same way, to understand the accuracy of
Argelander's observations.          In North America, on the con
trary, as in Siberia, the crown of the auroral arc must more
nearly coincide, on the average, with the magnetic meridian ;

  I  am not, however, acquainted with any results of observations,
  freed from accidental perturbations, of a nature to confirm or
 refute this assumption.
      Wilcke* had already observed that the place of the auroral
 crown is in the zenith of the magnetic meridian, or in its vi
 cinity. The correctness of his observations has been many
  times confirmed since then by other physicists.          The above-
  mentioned French Expedition made 43 determinations, the
  mean result of which was, that the situation of the crown de
  viates less than 1° from the magnetic zenith.        The difference,
 however, between the two positions amounted to 15° on one
 occasion, and to 12° on two others.
      In explaining the annual period of frequency of the aurorae
 boreales shown by the observations, the following circum
 stances must be considered : — The electric fluid accumulated
 in the earth's atmosphere by the unipolar induction of the ter
 restrial magnet descends to the surface of the earth either by
 disruptive discharges (thunder-storms), or in feeble continuous
 currents.      The former have their principal frequency between
 the tropics, and the latter in high latitudes. The fluid which
 does not flow to the earth in tie first of these two ways, is
 conducted by the magnetic force to higher latitudes, where it
 flows down in the form of continuous currents.           From this it
 follows that the rarer and weaker the tempests, the more in
 tense and numerous must the aurorae boreales be, and vice
 versa.     In the zone of calms, immediately to the north of the
 equator, thunder is heard throughout the year; but the limits
 of this zone vary from one season to another. Outside of that
 zone, but between the tropics, thunder-storms travel, like the
 rainy seasons, with the sun. We can therefore assume that
 the quantity of the electric fluid which within the tropics de
 scends to the earth in tempests is not the same all through
 the year.       As is known, the aurorse boreales present two
 maxima, viz. at the spring and autumn equinoxes. According
 to our view the tempests would consequently be the weakest,
or, rather, the least quantity of electric fluid would descend in
lightning from the atmosphere to the surface of the earth,
 within the tropics, when the sun crosses the equinoctial line.
We have not sufficient materials of observation for deciding
whether this view is correct or notf.
     It cannot be admitted that the electric fluid flows down upon
the earth only on the occasion of aurorae boreales.         Beyond all
doubt the flow is continual, although mostly the currents do

not possess the force to render the air luminous.              The electric
fluid is driven into the air, by forces incessantly active, from
every point of the earth from the equator to the localities
where the downflow is effected ; and that fluid is at the same
time conducted from the lower to the higher latitudes. We
must therefore admit the incessant passage of currents from
the equator towards the poles, while the electric fluid circu
lates in the opposite direction within the earth.            This does not
mean that the direction of these currents is entirely north and
south, many causes contributing to make them deviate from
that direction. We picture to ourselves the atmosphere cut by
a plane parallel to the equatorial plane and situated between
that plane and the auroral ring. The electric fluid driven by
 the active forces of the earth into the atmosphere between the
 equatorial plane and the plane in question must then pass
 through the latter. The sum of the currents passing through
 a plane of this kind will therefore be greater in proportion as
 the latitude of the plane is higher ; consequently the intensity
 of the currents increases from the equator towards the poles.
 Although the electromotive forces to which these currents are
 due are always the same, yet their intensity must be subject
 to incessant variations, seeing that it of course depends also
 on the resistance they meet with in their course.              This resist
 ance must depend in great part on the constitution of the air
 in its lower strata : when these are saturated with humidity,
 the electric resistance is much less than when they are rela
 tively dry. As, for this reason, these primitive currents often
  vary in intensity, induction currents will result, of a sort to
  complicate still more the system of currents we are here con
  sidering.
      It is obvious that these currents must act upon a declina
  tion-needle placed at the surface of the earth ; but to calculate
  the intensity and direction of the action is not so easy.           In the
  first place, the currents in question act directly on the declina
  tion-needle almost in the same manner as the current which
  passes through the circuits of a galvanometer acts on the
  needle of that instrument ; and, in the second place, it must
  be remembered that the earth contains a quantity of magneti
  zable materials, the magnetic condition of which is modified
  the zone of maximum of aurorae boreales shifts so as to be found more
  northward during the winter and summer than at the periods of the
  autumnal and vernal equinoxes.      If this be confirmed by future observa
  tions, the annual variation ascertained at lower latitudes may be accounted
  for by this displacement.   (See Nordlichtbeobachtunffen der osterreichitch-
  ungarifchen arktisehen Expedition 1872-1874, bv C. Weyprecht : Vienna.

by these currents.     All these circumstances have a marked
influence upon the declination. Thus, although it may be im
possible beforehand to determine exactly the action of these
currents upon the declination-needle, we can compare the va
riations of the declination with the results given by the obser
vations.
   The relative humidity of the air is in general greater during
the night than during the day.        It may be taken as a rule that
the diurnal variation of that humidity increases with the varia
tion of its temperature : it is consequently greater in summer
than in winter. The conductivity of the air,and, in consequence,
also the intensity of the currents in question, have therefore a
diurnal and an annual period. Now, if it be admitted that
the diurnal variations of the declination depend chiefly on the
variations in the intensity of the currents we are considering,
it follows that the diurnal variations of the declination should
be greater in summer than in winter, and should moreover in
crease with the distance from the equator — a deduction con
firmed, as we know, by the observations. To this may be
added that the action upon the -declination-needle does not de
pend exclusively on the nature of the air and the intensity of
the current at the locality in which the needle is placed ; the
intensity of the currents in localities the most distant acts also,
although in a less degree.     Besides, it is evident that here we
have to do with the humidity of the air not merely at the sur
face of the earth, but also in the upper strata of the atmo
sphere.    We ought not, then, to expect that the variations of
declination at a given place will be in direct proportion to the
humidity of the air at the same place.
   When, for one cause or another, the current descending to
the earth from the upper regions of the atmosphere has ac
quired sufficient intensity, it produces a luminosity in the rare
fied air, aud we then have the aurora borealis.      If the current
is endowed with an invariable intensity (as appears to be the
case in some of the feebler aurorae boreales), the needle remains
pretty steady ; but when there are rapid variations in the in
tensity of the current, or when its maximum of intensity shifts
from one point to another (in which case the aurora becomes
sparkling and changes its aspect continually), the needle, as
can be readily understood, becomes agitated and moves vio
lently.   This agitation extends over a considerable portion of
the earth's surface, and thus indicates what is going on in the
atmosphere, even when no aurora borealis is perceived.
   The thesis that the aurorae boreales are produced by electric
currents is not new ; the majority of physicists have long been
                                                                     n

one has been able to discover the true and most active cans*
of those currents, as well as of the electrical phenomena of
the atmosphere in general.      In fact there are good grounds
for asserting that none of the explanations given, up to the
present, of these phenomena will bear the examination of scien
tific criticism.  If, till now, no one has seen in these pheno
mena the results of the unipolar induction of the earth, it                    is,
without any doubt, because an idea has been formed           the          of
nature of that induction which did not permit its application
to this object.
   There still remain many things that are obscure in the                      phe
nomena of the aurora borealis and atmospheric electricity.
Of these  it will be sufficient to indicate the secular periods                in
the frequency of aurorae boreales.      The relation of these                  pe

                                                          directly
and the other inversely as the length.      Now the insulation of
land-lines is in this country very variable, while the real con
duction resistance      e. its resistance
                        (t.              if itwere perfectly insu

so that threequantities have to be observed, viz.       E,

yt; or equivalent information must       be obtained.    To make
the test in its simplest form, let the resistances Ri and
                                                            Es be
small compared with the line resistance.        Also, let equally
sensitive tangen1>galvanometers be used, and let nt and n^ be
the deflections corresponding to ^ and ys, and n3 the deflec
tion   Egives through 1000 ohms.      Then (2) becomes

    It is to be observed that these "formula? give the true con
duction and insulation resistances.           The measured resistances,
or those deduced from          observations   with the bridge, differen

ferent from the true, when the line is long and badly insulated.
The measured is always less than the true conduction resist

resistance ; while the measured conduction resistance can never
be greater than >/ ki, and the measured insulation resistance
never less.
LVI.     On Electrical Discharges in Insulators.          By Dr. W. C.
    Rontgen, Professor of Physics in the University of Stras-
    burg* .
                           communication are contained the results
IN of an following
        the
               experimental      investigation begun long since, but
often interrupted,        on  the  disruptive discharge of electricity
 through insulators ; for       I had  set myself the task to discover
 whether in such a discharge there exists any expressible rela
 tion between the physical constitution of the insulator, the
 difference of potential required for a discharge, and the quan
 tity of electricity discharged. The investigation extended to
 solid, liquid, and gaseous bodies ; but up to the present time
 I  have only succeeded with the latter in finding such a relation.
     The solid bodies, mostly crystals, were placed, in the form
 of thin plates, between two rounded-off brass points, one of
 which was led away to earth, the other connected with a source
 of electricity, mostly a Holtz machine. By slow rotation of
 the machine the potential was raised until a spark passed
 through the thin plate.         An electrometer specially constructed
 for the present     case  permitted the course of the potential to be

 from the Nachrichten der Kon. Geselhchaft zu Gottingen, 1878.

  traced, and the potential itself to be accurately determined at
  the moment of the discharge.          I hoped in this way to obtain,
  with plates of different substances and especially with plates
  cut in different directions out of the same crystal, a charac
  teristic difference of potential for each substance and for each
  direction ; but hitherto all my endeavours have been fruitless.
  I  found it impossible, with one and the same plate, to obtain
  satisfactorily accordant values from the different experiments
  of one and the same series. The cause of this irregularity is
  doubtless to be sought in an unavoidable difference in the dis
  position of the electricity on the points and the plate. The
  difference of potential necessary for a spark-discharge is essen
  tially dependent on this disposition, which, in the method of
  experiment chosen, changes before the spark passes, in con
  sequence of a less or greater conductivity of the plate and its
  surface, as well as in consequence of electricity added by con
  vection from the point in an irregular and uncontrollable
  manner.      Perhaps, if experiments were made with much larger
  plates and with very obtusely pointed electrodes, more favour
  able results might be obtained.
      The experiments which       I  made with liquids are, notwith
  standing their number, still too imperfect, and offer too few
  general points of view, for their details to be communicated.
      As is well known, electrical discharges in gases have often
  been the subject of investigation ; both the spark-discharge
  with greater and less pressures and also the slow discharge
   known by the name of dissipation have been repeatedly ex
  amined. From these experiments no simple relation can be
   with certainty deduced between any constant of the different
   gases and the difference of potential corresponding to each
I  gas, necessary for a discharge, or the amount of electricity
   discharged. Yet it would be hazardous to conclude, on the
   ground of those experiments, that such a relation does not
   exist. For, in the first place, with spark-discharges it is
   always to be feared that the decomposition which doubtless
   takes place in some gases, as well as the considerable alteration
   of temperature in the path of the spark, may possibly conceal
   any such relation ; and, secondly, some hitherto unpublished
   experiments made by M. Warburg have shown that in gases
   dissipation cannot with certainty be demonstrated ; while the
   loss of electricity by conductors which are insulated in gases,
   observed by Coulomb, Riess, Warburg, and others, is very
   probably brought about only by the insulating supports and
   by particles of dust *.
      I therefore, after numerous preliminary experiments and

440              Prof. W. C. Hontgeu on Electrical
mature reflection, resolved to select for my purpose a kind of
discharge which has hitherto been but little studied, viz. the
so-called discharge by convection, such as is known to take
place between a very sharp point and a large smooth plate.
I  believe  I                                              I
              may indeed attribute it to this selection, if finally
succeeded in discovering the relation sought.
    The method of experiment at last found serviceable was the
following.     A Holtz machine was kept in action with as con
stant and high velocity of rotation of its disk as possible, by
means of a Schmidt water motor.         One of the electrodes was
connected with the earth by the gas-pipes ; and from the other a
copper wire covered with gutta percha led to the inside coat
ings of two Leyden jars constructed according to W. Thom
son's plan, of well-insulating glass and containing sulphuric
acid, the outside coatings of which were led away to earth.
These jars formed an electrical reservoir of considerable
capacity, and were intended to diminish as much as pos
sible the variations of potential which might be occasioned
by an irregular development of electricity by the machine.
Behind these jars the wire was divided.          One branch went
to a narrow glass tube filled with glycerine, which served
as a rheostat ; by lowering into or drawing out of it a metallic
conductor to earth, the resistance of the glycerine could be
fixedly diminished or augmented. The other branch led first
to the point in the discharge-apparatus, and from that to an
electrometer constructed expressly for the investigation.
   The discharge-apparatus consisted of the following parts : —
A vertical brass rod, provided beneath with a gilt sewing-
needle, passed well insulated through the tubular neck of a
glass bell, which was fitted air-tight upon the plate of an air-
pump.      In the space enclosed oy the bell stood, carefully
insulated from the plate, at a distance of 19'3 millims., with
its centre opposite the point, a polished brass disk of 132 mil
lims. diameter ; this was in conducting connexion with one
end of the coiled wire of an extremely delicate mirror-galva
nometer consisting of a great number of turns ; the other ex
tremity of the wire led to the gas-pipes. By an air-pump and
further suitable arrangements the bell could be filled with
different gases at various pressures determined by a mano
meter.
   The electrometer made use of proved, it is true, serviceable
for the present investigation; but it still has some defects,
which must be removed ;     I am therefore engaged in construct-
ing a better apparatus, of which    I  hope subsequently to give
an account.     I will only mention further that it was arranged
after the manner of Thomson's quadrant-electrometer, and that

                      Difdiaryeis in Insulator t,               441
the readings were reduced to comparable measure by compa
rison with a long-range electrometer which           I had made for
the most part according to Thomson's description.
    It was found that 6 of the units in which in the follow
ing the differences of potential are expressed correspond to a
potential-difference of about 5 Daniells.         I would not, how
ever, lay too much stress upon these data, since the battery
at my disposal was too small to enable me to accomplish a
more accurate determination.
    Now, if we assume that the Holtz-machine electrode which
is connected with the gas-pipes conducts away negative elec
tricity, the positive electricity issuing from the other electrode
finds two paths — the first through the rheostat to the gas-
pipes, and the second through the discharge-apparatus and the
galvanometer, likewise to the gas-pipes.            The quantity of
electricity   which  passes through   the discharge-apparatus can
now be varied within wide limits by altering the resistance of
the rheostat.      The galvanometer indicates this quantity ; and
the electrometer measures the difference of potential between
the point and the plate.
    I  soon observed that the discharge does not take place with
every difference of potential, but that rather a perfectly fixed
difference is always necessary in order to induce it. If at
the commencement of the experiment the resistance of the rheo
stat has been made nearly = 0 (when of course the deflections
of the galvanometer and electrometer are likewise = 0), and if
 now the resistance be gradually increased, on the electrometer
 indeed a steady rise of the potential will be observed, but the
 potential must have reached a certain value before the galva
 nometer will show, by a sudden, proportionally great, and
 constant deflection (if the resistance of the rheostat remains
 invariable), that the discharge has commenced. When once the
 discharge is present the resistance of the rheostat and conse
 quently the potential can be again diminished, through which
 the discharge, it is true, steadily decreases, but does not at
 once sink to zero.      Only with a considerably less potential-
 difference than that with which the discharge commenced does
 it again entirely cease.
     I  found, further, that the commencement of the discharge
 was dependent on many collateral circumstances, e. g. whether
 a discharge had taken place a shorter or a longer time pre
 viously ; unavoidable dust particles, too, have probably an
 influence.     On the other hand, determinations of the difference
 of potential at which the discharge ceases, derived from differ
 ent experiments separated from one another by considerable

 442                Prof. W. C. Rontgen on Electrical
 intervals of time, gave values which agreed excellently with
 each other.    I  resolved on this account, at least preliminarily,
 to direct my attention chiefly to the determination of this dif
 ference of potential, which we will name the minimum poten
 tial-difference, and, for brevity, denote by M. P.
    The moment when the discharge ceases              is,
                                                      for the most
 part,  characterized   by this — that the already much diminished
 galvanometer-deflection (amounting to only 2-4 scale divi
 sions), aftera   further very slight lessening of the resistance in
 the rheostat, suddenly becomes zero. At this instant the M. P.
is  read off at the electrometer.      I am inclined to account for
 this phenomenon by the small variations which the potential
 undergoes notwithstanding the insertion of the Leyden jars.
  The electrometer, which        provided with
                                  is            a   powerful damper,
  gives the  mean   value of  the  variations of the potential.    The
  fact that the discharge had now really ceased      I    verified also
 in another way that:        to say,
                             is         the galvanometer was made
                                           if
 considerably   more   sensitive  by being rendered more perfectly
 astatic, its deflection vanished at exactly the same difference
 of potential as before in like manner an electroscope, which
                         ;
 instead of the galvanometer was connected with the plate in
 the discharge-apparatus, was not charged, and the characteristic
 star-shaped luminous appearance visible in the dark, which
 was present during the discharge, disappeared when the M.P.
 was attained.
    In all the following experiments the distance of the point
 from the plate remained the same.         Further, the temperature
 was constant, at least in those experiments which were to be
 compared with one another; and, lastly,        it   is to be noticed
 that the point was always positive when the contrary          is  not
 expressly stated.
     Unfortunately, the investigation had to be interrupted, first
 because the seasons of spring and summer are very unsuitable
 for working with static electricity, and secondly because for
 its continuation the reconstruction of some of the apparatus,
 especially of the electrometer, had become absolutely neces
 sary. Consequently, of the many questions which might be
 put, only a few can be answered.        The results are given Below.
    1. How does the M. P. in         gas depend on the pressure
                                       a                             ?
 The question was repeatedly answered for dry air free from
carbonic acid. Fig. represents the result of one experiment:
                         1
the pressures in millims. of mercury were laid down as ab
scissae, and the M. P. as ordinates.         The unit in which the
latter are expressed    isnot directly comparable with that men
tioned above.

   It follows from these experiments that with pressures above
200 millims. the increase of the pressure is at least nearly pro-
                                                               .-

M. P. diminishes much more quickly in proportion.                      Similar
ratios were found        with  other  gases.
   2. How, in a gas which is subjected to a fixed pressure, is
the quantity of electricity discharged connected with the dif
ference of potential between the point and the plate ?
   Dry air, free from carbonic acid, was tried with the pres
sures 391, 294, 203-4, 109-7, and 51-8 millims. mercury. The
highest difference of potential which could be determined with
my electrometer was 3684 units (6 units = 5 Daniells) ; the
greatest quantity of electricity that could be measured amounted
to something over 500 arbitrarily chosen units.                   The follow
ing Tables contain in the first column the differences of poten
tial, in the second the corresponding amounts of electricity
discharged; and in the third           I have given, under the name of
" disposable potential-differences," the differences between the
numbers in the first column and the M. P. corresponding to
each pressure, the quantity of electricity discharged being of
course =0.        I have calculated these differences, and given
them the name above mentioned, because possibly the view is

444                  Prof. W. C. Rontgen on Electrical

   In these experiments, as already mentioned, the difference
of potential was constant. But as, according to No.            with                          1,

tively at different potential-differences, the D. P. were not the
same ; it was consequently still questionable whether any
 simple relation subsisted between pressure and electricity dis
 charged, if with different pressures not the absolute but the
 disposable potential-difference was found constant.                  The ques
 tion can be     answered     from  the  data  of  No.  2.    I  have extracted
 from the Tables the following comparison, valid for the D. P.

     Pressure in millims. of mercury   ...  391     294    203-4   109-7  51-8
     Amount of electricity discharged ...     71     79    106     194   450
     In fig.    4  will be found the graphic representation.                   A
 simple relation is not perceptible.             To be sure the product of
 the pressure into the quantity of electricity for the last four
  pressures is nearly constant; but with the pressure 391 there
 is a. considerable deviation from this rule.              For the purpose of
  fully answering questions 2 and 3, experiments with different
  gases, between wider limits of the potential-differences, tin;
  pressures, and the quantities of electricity discharged, will 1m
  absolutely necessary.
     4. Does an expressible relation exist between the minimum
  difference of potential and the nature of the various gases in
  which the discharge takes place ?
     The gases were all tried at two pressures, approximately 20o
  and 110 inillima. mercury; experiments with higher pressure*

 were excluded, because with some of the gases the electrometer
 was not equal to measuring the corresponding differences
 of potential.     I  must mention that these experiments are not
directly comparable with the preceding ones. The following
Table contains the mean values of various satisfactorily ac

    In this Table the gases are arranged in the order of ascending
values of the M. P.           If  this series be compared with that which
is obtained when the gases are arranged in the order of dimin
ishing values of their mean molecular path-lengths, at both
 205 and 110 millims. pressure perfect agreement will be found.
 Since the minimum difference of potential is a direct measure
of the insulating-power of a gas, the result contained in the
above Table can be expressed in the following manner : — The
shorter the path of its molecules, the greater is the insulating-
power of a gas.           Now it is known that the smaller the gas-
molecules the greater is the length of their paths ; consequently
we can also say: — The larger tie molecules of a gas the greater
is its power to insulate.
   The connexion between the M. P. and the length of path
becomes still more convincingly evident when for each gas we
form the product of the path-length and M. P.

everywhere omitted.                                        104
   From these numbers we obtain a remarkable relation : it
follows, namely, from both the first and the second series, that
the product of the path-length and the minimum difference of
potential, measured at equal pressure, has nearly the same value
with all the gases investigated.
    Stefan pointed out the connexion between path-length and
index of refraction ; Boltzmann's experiments have shown
that the dielectric capacity of gases stands to the index of
refraction in the relation required by Maxwell's law ; and the
present investigation brings the insulating-power of gases into
causal connexion with the three above-mentioned properties.
Accordingly the insulating-power of a gas is by so much less as
the inductive capacity of the gas is greater, and vice versd.
    Similar simple relations exist between path-length and M. P.
for one and the same gas at different pressures ; a simple dis
cussion of the experiments spoken of under question 1 leads to
this result.
    Besides the gases above adduced, olefiant gas was examined.
It was not found to conform to the same law ; for the products
of the M. P. and the path-length at the pressures 205 and 1 10
millims. were respectively 149 and 123.         I believe, however,
 that no importance need be attached to this deviation, since
the phenomena attending the discharges were of quite a differ
ent character from those with the other gases, and permit us
almost certainly to conclude that decomposition of this gas
took place.
    In conclusion, in moist air the M. P., and consequently the
 insulating-power, was much greater than in dry air.
    5. A series of experiments with air and hydrogen prove
 that, cceteris paribus, the M. P. is less when the point is charged
 with negative than when it is charged with positive electricity;
 whether the like takes place also in regard to the difference of
 potential at which the discharge commences         I  have not yet
 been able to decide.

  IN Rogers,
          accordance
                     I  endeavoured      to find what modes of central
  force will best represent some of the most general forms of
 chemical activity, more especially those which are the base of
  the law of Avogadro and Ampere —of combination by volume,
 and of approximate constancy in the product of atomic weight
 by specific heat.
     The simplicity of the ratio between the energy of H3 O and
 the solar energy at Earth's mean distance f furnishes good
 grounds for such an investigation, while the record of a para
 bolic orbit connecting the Sun with the nearest fixed stars                J
 indicates a proper course for conducting it. Although there
 may be some doubt as to the degree of certainty which belongs
 to the recent hypotheses of internal gaseous structure, there
 can be none as to the graphic representation of orbital activi
 ties under forces varying inversely as the square of the dis
 tance.     Circular orbits denote constancy of relations between
 radial and tangential forces ; elliptic orbits, variability of rela
 tions accompanied by cyclical oscillations ; parabolic orbits,
 variability of relations without cyclical oscillations ; hyperbolic
orbits, variability of relations complicated by the action of
 extraneous force.
     In a rotating mass, the orbits of the several particles are
circular.       If  the uniform velocity of any particle in the equa
torial plane is less than ^fr, the mean action of the central
force is impeded by internal collisions or resistances.               If the
velocities of all the particles in the plane vary precisely as -Sfr,
there is a condition of perfect fluidity, mar king a limit between
complete aggregation and incipient dissociation.                  Any cyclic
variations ofvelocity between constant limits indicate elliptic
orbits, with tendencies to aggregation through collisions near
the perifocal apse.          A perifocal velocity of -J 2fr marks a pa
rabolic orbit, and a limit between complete dissociation and
incipient association. A velocity greater than -J 2fr is hy
perbolic, indicating the intervention of a third force in addi
tion to the mutual action between the two principal centres of
reference.

between resisting points, those points tend naturally to nodal,
and from internodal positions.          In order to maintain unifor
mity    in   the wave-velocity,     the  aetherial molecules must bo
uniform,    not  only in volume, but also in aggregate inertia. As
the inertia of the resisting points increases, the inertia due to
internal aetherial motions should therefore diminish, and vice
versa.     In other words, the uniform elementary volume may
be represented by the product of atomic weight by specific
heat; and the laws of Boyle (or Mariotte), Charles, and Avo-
gadro follow as simple and necessary corollaries.
     In order that uniform undulations should produce motion,
there must be at least two points of resistance.             Those points
would approach each other until the interior undulating resist
ance equalled the exterior undulatory pressures, when their
 motion would be converted into rotation or into orbital revo
 lution.    Their common centre of revolution might become the
 centre of a new elementary volume, thus giving rise to the
 various laws of combination by volume, combination without
 condensation, condensation of two volumes into one, three
 volumes into two, or four volumes into two, as well as to
 general artiad and perissad quanti valence.
     When perifocal collisions change parabolic or elliptic into
 circular orbits, there should be increasing density towards the
  principal centre of the system.         Further collisions and con
 densations would produce tendencies to both nucleal and atmo
  spheric* aggregations, and consequent binary groupings.
  These laws are exemplified in the solar system by the general
  division into an intra-asteroidal and an extra-asteroidal belt,
  and by the subdivision of each belt into two pairs, —the inner
  belt being denser than the outer, and the inner member of each
  pair being denser than its companion — Mercury being denser
  than Venus, Earth than Mars, Jupiter than Saturn, Uranus
  than Neptune.       This arrangement towards the Sun as a prin
  cipal centre appears, however, to be of more recent date than
  the tendency to condensation in the Telluric belt ; for Earth
  is denser than Venus, and the great secular ellipticities of Mars
  and Mercury suggest the likelihood of a quasi-cometary origin.
  Similar tendencies would contribute to the chemical grouping
  of atoms by pairs, which is essential for polarity and for the
  already enumerated laws of chemical combination.
      In the " nascent state " particles may be regarded either as
  parabolically perifocal, with the velocity of complete dissocia
  tion from a given centre, or as relatively at rest, and ready to
  obey the slightest impulses of central force. The mean vis
  viva of a system formed by two such particles would be

    At the parabolic limit between complete dissociation and

 sistance, by 4a;n ; the succes
 sive differences of major axis
 by 4. Each normal, vnfn+t,
 equals    the next ordinate,
 t'a+i/n+i ; there are, therefore, triple tendencies, both in the
axis of abscissas and on each branch of the curve, to successive
differences of 4 in the major axes of aggregation, in conse
quence of the meeting of abscissal, ordinal, and normal waves
in the axis, and the meeting of tangential, normal, and abscissal
waves upon the curve.        At each node of aggregating collision
 two of the wave systems are due to normally alternating rect-
 angular oscillations, the third serving as a link between the
axial and the peripheral waves.       The bisection of the normals
by their equivalent ordinates adds importance to the normal
major axes, and increases the tendency to aggregation at their
respective centres of gravity.
    Chemical molecules and atoms are so small that we are un
able at present to show so conclusively as in cosmical gravita
tion that the " nascent " velocity, or the mean radial velocity
 at the limit between complete dissociation and incipient aggre
gation, is equivalent to the velocity of light.   But the analogies
which are here presented are strengthened by the frequent
vivid, luminous, and thermal accompaniments of chemical
change, and by the electric polarity of combining elements.
It seems, therefore, reasonably certain that the same limiting
unit of velocity and vis viva, which can be easily traced in
light, heat, electricity, and gravitation, is also fundamentally
efficient in chemical affinity.     M. Aymonnet, in his commu

452       Prof. P. E. Chase on       the Nebular Hypothesis.
   At  the time of the late total solar eclipse, Watson and Swift
each observed two small planets between the orbit of Mercury
and the sun.       By comparing the published position of the
planet   which   was  first announced by Watson, with some of the
most trustworthy of the recorded observations which were
thought by Leverrier to indicate intra-Mercurial Transits,
Gaillot and Mouchez found an orbital period of 24-25 days*,
which represents the third interior term of my series and the
second strict verification of my prediction.
   If  a nebula condenses until all the particles in the equato
rial plane have an orbital velocity, the mean radial vis viva at
the orbital centre of linear oscillation (^r) is equivalent to the
orbital vis vica at 9 r. This equality may, perhaps, help to
account for the following approximate division of the planetary
system, the unit being Sun's radius :
                                              —
   92r =    Sir.     Mercury's mean radius vector              83'17r.

   94r = 6561r.      Neptune's extreme radius vector.. .6546'67 r.
   The relatively rapid motion of Phobos (the inner satellite of
Mars), as well as the newly found meteoroidal character of the
corona, may reasonably lead us to look for an indefinite number
of further verifications among the results of future discovery.
Many of them, like many of the Neptunian harmonies which
are modified by the overshadowing mass of Jupiter, will pro
bably elude all attempts at discovery; but the apparent import
ance of 9 as a cosmical factor gives interest to the second series
in the following Table.       The denominators in the first series are
                              —
of the general form (4n 3) ; those in the second series are of
the t'orm(4i'— 3 = 144n — 111), v being equivalent to 9(4n — 3).
   According to the nebular hypothesis, when Sun was ex
panded to the present orbit of Jupiter, the collisions of subsi
ding particles would tend to form a ring at two thirds the dis
tance, or at 3'469 times Earth's mean radius vector.             If  we
take this as a harmonic unit, j, we find that Venus's mean
perihelion is well represented by £, Mercury's mean distance
by £, and Kirkwood's estimated semi-major axis of "Vulcan"
by -jy. Here are, therefore, four terms of the first harmonic
series, with a denominator-difference of 4.

    The first term of the second series (Helios) represents an
orbital node in which the time of revolution would be synchro
nous with that of a solar half-rotation.                 I
                                               This, as have already
said, is equivalent to the time in which the continuous accele
ration or retardation of Sun's superficial gravitation would
communicate or overcome the velocity of Light.              In order to
maintain equality of areas, the time of rotation in an expand
ing or contracting nucleus should vary as the square of radius.
But g varies inversely as the square of radius ; so that gt
should be constant at all stages of solar condensation, past,
present, or future.
   The second term of the series (Themis) represents an orbital
node in. which planetary revolution would be accomplished in
a sidereal day, or synchronously with Earth's rotation on its
axis. The closeness of its relation to Earth, and its accordance
with the laws of harmony, are both fitly designated by its
name —Themis havingbeen regarded as the daughter of Heaven
and Earth, and as the goddess of law and order.
    The third term of the series (Eunomia) represents an or
bital node in which planetary revolution would be accom
plished synchronously with Jupiter's rotation on its axis. Its
designation has also a double fitness ; for Eunomia was the
mythical daughter of Jupiter and Themis, her name signifying
" good government."
    The fourth term of the series (Phaos) represents an orbital
node in which planetary revolution would be synchronous with
two planetary revolutions at Sun's surface.
    The fifth term of the series (Lychnis) represents an orbital
node at which Herschel's theoretical "subsidence" would
 give Sun's present velocity of rotation.
    The sixth term of the series represents a node which is some
 what within Sun's apparent surface, or at its actual surface, pro
vided the depth of the photosphere is 1 per cent. of Sun's radius.
    The one hundred and eighty-seventh term of the first series
 represents an orbital node at the upper surface of Sun's pho
 tosphere.    Its harmonic denominator represents the ratio of
 Sun's mass to the aggregate planetary mass.
    We see, therefore, in the second series, not only the nodal
 influence of the largest two bodies in the system (Sun and

454           Sir   J.   Conroy on   the   Light reflected
Jupiter), but also an accordant influence of our own planet,
which is the central orb and the largest planet in the belt
which is bounded by the secular perihelion of Mercury and the
secular aphelion of Mars.
   Herschel's modified presentation of the nebular hypothesis,
and Gummere's criterion, furnish the needful grounds for a
satisfactory explanation of such remarkable velocities as that
of the inner moon of Mars. They also seem to require that
secondary orbs, when they revolve in less time than is required
for the rotation of their primaries, should be denser than the
primaries.    There is therefore good reason for the further pre
diction that, whenever the density of Phobos is ascertained, it
will be found to be greater than that of the planet itself.           If
Mars has any other moons which have an orbital period of less
than twenty-four hours, they should also be of like superior
density.    In these harmonies, as well as in many others, the
pointing to the primeval organizing agency of light is inter
esting and suggestive. At (he theoretical period of each of
the harmonic divisions, and at all other stages of nebular con
densation, the rhythmical rotation of our day-star has been
repeating its unvarying confirmation of the old, old -record.
In the dim and distant past, in the living present, and through
all coming time, from the great " Beginning," until the cul
mination of prophecy when "the elements shall melt with
fervent heat, nothing but divine intervention has disturbed,
or can disturb, the equality between the accumulated action
of solar gravity for a half-rotation and the velocity of light.
The harmonic hypothesis forecasts the same requirement at
the surface of the central orb in every stellar system; so that
the closing refrain in the hymn of each of the morning stars
is, was, and ever shall be: —
  " And   God said, Let there be light        ;   and there was light."
 LVIII.    On the Light reflected     by   Potassium Permanganate.
              By Sir JOHN      CONROY,      Bart., M.A.*
          light reflected from the surface of potassium perman
THEganate      was originally examined by Haidinger, who an
nounced (Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wis~
senschaften, Band viii. 1852, p. 133), that when the light
reflected from the surface of the crystals and of the substance
rubbed on a plate of glass was examined with           dichroiscopic
                                                        a
lens, the portion polarized in the plane of incidence was light
yellow at low angles, and became white as the angle increased,
whilst the portion polarized perpendicularly was light yellow,
and became green and blue as the angle increased.

    Professor Stokes found (Phil. Mag. vi. 1853, p. 400) that
the reflected light contained four bright bands, corresponding
in position to the dark bands of the absorption spectrum of a
solution of the substance, and that when the reflected light
was separated into two streams polarized in, and perpendicular
to, the plane of incidence, and then examined by a prism, the
bands were hardly visible in the one, and the other at a certain
angle consisted mainly of them.
    E. Wiedemann has recently published (Pogg. Ann. cli.
1874, p. 625) an account of some experiments he has made
on the same subject.     He found that whilst the dark bands of
the reflection spectrum did not even partially cover those of
the absorption spectrum, they did not lie exactly intermediate
between any two of them — and, further, that the position of
the bands was independent of the angle of incidence, both with
ordinary light, and with that polarized in the plane of inci
dence ; but with light polarized perpendicularly to this plane,
the bands occupied the same position up to a certain angle,
and then with a slight increase of the angle suffered sudden
displacement towards the blue, and a new band appeared near
D. He also found that with light polarized perpendicularly
to the plane of incidence, the position of the bands was inde
pendent of the nature of the surrounding medium, being the
same when the permanganate was in air, benzene, and bisul
phide of carbon ; but when the light was polarized in the plane
of incidence, with the increase of the refractive index of the me
dium the bands were more and more displaced towards the blue.
                            I
    For some experiments have made on the same subject 1
have used a Babinet's goniometer, which has, in addition to the
ordinary horizontal stage, a vertical one so arranged that the
reflecting surface can be placed over the axis of the instru
ment. Sunlight was used, which could be polarized in any
plane by a Nicol supported by the fixed arm of the goniometer ;
and a small direct-vision spectroscope,      by Hilger, with a
" bright-point " micrometer and a reflecting prism for bring
ing a second spectrum into the field, was carried by the other
arm of the goniometer.      By placing a beaker on the horizontal
stage, and, after the surface of the permanganate had been pro-
peny adjusted, filling it with the liquid and limiting the inci
dent beam by a narrow vertical slit, the light reflected from
the surface of the substance when immersed in a liquid could
be examined.
    The experiments were usually made with potassium per
manganate crushed, and burnished with an agate on a piece of
finely-ground glass ; and it was found that the light reflected
 from the surface of crystals and from that of the substance
rubbed on glass was identical ; except that the blue rays were

456                 Sir   J.  Conroy         on the   Light reflected
more intense in the light reflected by the crystals, and the
higher bands were more distinctly seen.
   The surface-colour of potassium permanganate, and the posi
tion and intensity of the bands in the spectrum of the reflected
light, are independent of the relative position of the plane of
incidence to the long axis of the crystal, or to the striae pro
duced by rubbing, when the powdered substance burnished on
glass is used.

sium permanganate appear of a pale yellow when light, either
unpolarized or polarized in any plane, is incident upon them
at low angles. But with ordinary light, and with light pola
rized in the plane of incidence, the amount of white light
reflected is so great at high angles that the surface-colour, if
any, is completely masked.
   When the incident light is polarized perpendicularly to the
plane of incidence, or when unpolarized light falls on the sur
face and a Nicol is placed between the eye and the permanga
nate, with its principal section in the plane of incidence, the
surface-colour is seen to change as the angle increases, becom
ing successively green and blue, and finally white and metallic.
   The surface-colours alter with the surrounding medium.
The following Table gives, approximately, the colour at various
incidences, (A) when the light is either unpolarized or pola
rized in the plane of incidence, and (B) when it is polarized
perpendicularly to that plane, for potassium permanganate in

   2. Reflection Spectra. — With uupolarized light, and still more
with light polarized in the plane of incidence, the dark bands
in the spectrum of the reflected light are never very distinct.
I  was not able to observe whether the bands shifted or not
as the angle of incidence increased, as the amount of white
light reflected at angles of 55° and upwards was so great as to
render the bands invisible.      They appeared, however, as long
as they were visible, to coincide exactly with the bright spaces
in the absorption spectrum of a dilute solution of potassium
permanganate, which was thrown into the field by means of
the reflecting prism.
   When the incident light is polarized perpendicularly to the
plane of incidence, the dark bands are far more distinctly seen.
At angles of less than 40° there are four bands, and the bine
end of the spectrum is very weak. As the angle of incidence
increases, the intensity of the blue rays diminishes; and then the
amount of light in the red decreases ; and at about 55° nearly
the whole of the light comes from the bright bands.
   As the angle of incidence increases beyond this amount, the
dark bands gradually move towards the blue end of the spec
trum ; and at about 60° a new band appears near D. With any-
further increase of the angle more of the blue rays are reflected;
and the bands fade away, those in the more refrangible part
of the spectrum disappearing first. The relative intensity of
the dark bands varies with the angle of incidence. When this
is small, the third and fourth bands, counting from the red end,
are darkest; with the increase of the angle the second, the
first, and finally the new band, become successively darkest.
    I have not been able to obtain any satisfactory measure
ments of the amount of the displacement of the bands, as,
when a spectroscope of sufficient power to render it an easily
measurable quantity is used, the bands become so ill-defined
that it is impossible to measure them.             Approximately the
                                                 "
displacement amounts to about '006 in tenth-metres ;" and
the bands tend to coincide with the dark bands of the absorp
tion spectrum, instead of with the bright bands as they do
when the angle of incidence is about 55 or less.
   The shaded portions of the diagrams are intended to give
the relative amount of light, as determined by eye estimations,
in the different portions of the absorption and reflection
spectra of potassium permanganate — the ordinates being taken
to represent the intensity, and the abscissae wave-lengths. The
curved line gives the mtensity of the light in the different
                                                                   *

light is polarized perpendicularly to the plane of incidence,
and falls on the surface at angles of 50°, 60°, and 70°.
   As has already been announced by Wiedemann, the position
of the bands in the reflected light depends on the nature of the
surrounding medium. From the experiments I have made, it
appears that, with unpolarized light, the first dark band of the
reflection spectrum corresponds in position with the first bright
band of the absorption spectrum, whether the permanganate
is in air, benzene, or either bisulphide or tetrachloride of car
bon; these liquids, however, act on the permanganate, and
after a short time the surface becomes altered, and then the
bands correspond with the dark bands of the absorption spec
trum.
   Figs. 4 and 5 represent the distribution of light in the spec
trum, with fresh surfaces of potassium permanganate in bisul
phide and tetrachloride of carbon, when unpolarized light is
incident upon them at an angle of about 55 : in both cases
the bands are wider apart than in air.

 LIX.     On  a possible  Cause'of the Formation      of Comets'" Tails.
                         By A. S. DAVIS, M.A*
IT formation
       is well known that
                    of comet's
                       a
                                the phenomena observed during the
                                    tail point to the conclusion that
the material which forms that appendage is being continually
emitted from the head of the comet with great velocity by
some force acting in a direction directly away from the sun.
The material appears in most cases to be first ejected from that
side of the comet's nucleus which is turned towards the sun,
and afterwards, under the influence of this force, to be turned
backwards to form a tail.          It is the object of this paper to
suggest an explanation of this force.
    The remarkable identity which has been found to exist be
tween the orbits of certain comets and the orbits of certain
meteoric clouds renders it little short of certain that comets
are themselves masses of solid or liquid bodies separated from
one another by great intervals, except perhaps at the nucleus,
where they may be closer together, and may even contain a
solid core.      The spectroscope indicates the presence of gas in
a state of incandescence in the comet's head and nucleus ; but
how this incandescent gas is produced is not known.
    The violent action which is observed to take place as a comet
approaches      the sun, on that side of its nucleus which is
exposed to the solar radiation, appears to indicate that the
comet consists largely of matter which is rapidly volatilized
under the influence of the sun's rays.
    Let us assume that such is the case, and let us consider
what will be the effect of evaporation on the motion of one of
 the bodies undergoing it.
    In the first place the mass of a comet is so small, that the
force of gravitation towards the centre on any of the bodies at
 some distance from the nucleus must be so small that it may
be left out of consideration.           We know that a molecule of
matter in the gaseous condition has at ordinary and high tem
peratures    a  very quick motion of translation.        A molecule, as
 it evaporates from the surface of one of the bodies composing
the comet, must acquire a velocity relative to the body of
 several hundred yards per second.            The body must in conse
 quence   suffer  a recoil in  an  opposite  direction  to that in which
the molecule escapes.        Now since the evaporation is caused
 by the sun's heat, it must take place chiefly on that side of the
body which is exposed to the sun,s rays. The resultant effect
 of all the small recoils due to the evaporation of the different
 molecules will therefore be to drive the body in a direction
away from the sun.         If the body has a motion of rotation, the
                    *
                      Communicated     by the Author.

460          Mr. A. S. Davis on a possible Cause of
whole surface might in turn become exposed to the sun's rays,
and evaporation would probably take place even on the side
turned away from the sun. But unless the body be of a re
gular shape, the effect of evaporation will be to gradually stop
any rotation which it might at first have ; for the force of
recoil from the evaporation would act upon it in the same way
as the wind does on a vane, and it would at length take up a
position with its longest axis in the direction of the sun.
    Now let V be the average velocity relative to the body with
which the molecules escape from it. Let M be the mass of
the body just before the escape of a molecule of mass /* from
it. Then the velocity due to the recoil as this molecule escapes
will be — V.      Now the molecules as they evaporate will start
off in various directions, but almost always more or less towards
the sun.    Let us suppose, as being not far from the truth, that
the inclination which their directions have to a straight line
passing through the sun is on the average 45° ; then the ave
rage velocity due to recoil acquired by the body on the evapo
ration of mass dm will be    —    •
                                    —75, and the velocity acquired

whilst the mass of the body is being reduced by evaporation
from ini to m3 will be

Now the average velocity of hydrogen molecules at 0° C. is
1'06, of oxygen '266, and of water vapour -35 mile per second.
For the sake of illustration, let us suppose that V = -35, and
*^  = 1000000, these being the values we should have to assign
TW2
if the body were a block of ice containing one gramme of sand
or any other non-volatile substance, the block itself being equal
in mass to a cubic metre of water. The velocity due to recoil
by evaporation would then be 3'42 miles per second, or about
295,000 miles per day. A tail would thus be formed which
would increase in length nearly a million miles in every three
days.    The visible portion of this tail would consist of solid or
liquid matter which had resisted evaporation ; but there would
also be present in the tail a large portion of the gas formed
during evaporation ; for since the evaporating gas nas a velo
city relative to the body from which it is evaporating of '35
mile per second, those portions of the gas which have evapo
rated since the body acquired by recoil a velocity greater than
•35 mile per second will be also carried backwards into the
tail. The estimate of the rapidity of tail-formation        I  have

just made has been made on the sapposition that the tempera
 ture of the escaping gas is 0° C. If the absolute temperature
in Centigrade units of the gas be t, we must multiply the
 above estimate by     A/

                                 . Now in no case has the rapidity
of tail-formation    greatly exceeded one million miles in three
 days, except  in  the case of those comets which have approached
very near to the sun, and where, consequently, the tempera
 ture at which the evaporation has taken place must have been
 very great. Donati's comet is one of the most striking ex
 amples of comets with large and rapidly formed tails which
 have not approached very near to the sun; and in Donati's
 comet the tail increased in length from 14 million miles on
 August 30 to 51 million miles on October 10, or at an average
 rate of somewhat less than a million miles in a day.
    Those comets which have formed large tails with exceptional
 rapidity have approached very near to the sun. Thus the
 comet of 1680, which formed a tail 60 million miles long in
 two days during its perihelion passage approached so near to
 the sun as to be exposed to a solar radiation 25,600 times more
 intense than that to which the earth is exposed.        To use Sir
 John Herschel's words, " In such a heat there is no solid sub
 stance we know of which would not run like water, boil, and
 be converted into vapour or smoke."        It seems probable that it
 is only the shortness of the time during which the comet is ex
 posed to such a temperature which prevents its being altogether
 converted into vapour. The smaller fragments of the comet
 will, 1 conceive, be entirely evaporated ; and the last portions
 of vapour from any fragment will, as I have shown, be carried
 backwards with immense velocity into the tail. After this
 vapour has arrived in colder regions, it seems probable that it
 will condense and become visible as a cloud of finely divided
 solid or liquid matter.     In these cases then the visible tail will
 consist, not of matter which has resisted evaporation, but
 largely and perhaps almost entirely of matter which has eva
 porated and has recondensed.
    In conclusion, if this be the true explanation of the pheno
  menon of comets' tails, then every meteoric cloud of matter
 which approaches sufficiently near to the sun to undergo rapid
  evaporation must become tailed like a comet, as it passes
 tlTrough its perihelion passage.        I  would suggest that we
  may have here an explanation of the      radiated structure of the
 sun's corona. As different masses of meteoric matter approach
 close to the sun, the smaller fragments will bo almost or entirely
  evaporated, a large portion of the vapour from them being
  carried rapidly away from the sun, thus giving rise to a

coronal protuberance. Thus the radiated structure, and the irre
gular and variable form of the corona would be accounted for.

The Theory of Sound.        By JOHN WILLIAM STBUTT, BABOIT BAY-
    LEIGH, M.A., F.R.S., formerly Fellow of Trinity College, Cam
    bridge.    Volume II.    London : MacMLUan and Co. 1878. 8vo,
    pp. 302.
           noticed the First volume of this work shortly after its pub-
        Hcation (5th ser. vol. v. p. 66). The Second volume — which, we
presume, completes the work* — is now before us. We could not,
perhaps, give it higher praise than to say that it is worthy of its
predecessor. Not to speak of actual contributions to our knowledge
of the Theory of Sound which have been made by the author, it is
 scarcely possible to overestimate the value to the student of a
 perfectly trustworthy work which brings together the substance
 of memoirs scattered through a variety of periodicals.            Not fewer
 than about a hundred and twenty or thirty memoirs are referred
 to in the course of these volumes, most of which would be inac-
 cesible to students living away from the chief centres of intel
 lectual activity.    These, however, are not the only students who
 are benefited by such a work as the present.               Even those who
 are more favourably situated rarely look at the memoirs unless
 they are distinctly interested in their subjects at the time of
 publication ; and this is particularly the case with memoirs on
 such a subject as the Theory of Sound, the mere reading of which
 may involve a considerable expenditure of time and labour.
    The subject of the present volume is Aerial Vibrations. In its
 general method it resembles its predecessor.            Thus, in the former
 volume, the discussion of Vibrating Systems in general (chap. iv.
 and v.) is preceded by a very careful consideration of a particular
 case, viz. that of a system having one degree of freedom (chap. iii.) ;
 so, in the present volume, the discussion of the general problem
 of vibrations in three dimensions (chap. xiv. and xv.) is preceded
 by that of the cases of Vibration in tubes (chap. xii.), and of some
 other special problems, including the Reflection and Refraction of
 Plane Waves (chap. xiii.). These four chapters, together with an in
 troductory chapter on "Aerial Vibrations (chap. xi.), fill more than
 half the volume. The remainder is divided into chapters on the
 Theory of Resonators (chap. xvi.), on Applications of Laplace's
 Functions to Acoustical Problems (chaps. xvii. and iviii.), and on
 Fluid Friction (chap. six.).
    » The Work, as it stands,
                                might certainly be accepted as a complete
 treatise on what is generally understood by the Theory of Sound, viz. the
 Kinetics of Acoustical Vibrations ; and we should have supposed the
 work to be complete had not the publisher made himself responsible for
 an announcement of Vol. iii., and also for a notice as to volumes subsequent
 to the first.

    The seventeenth and eighteenth chapters are almost wholly oc
cupied with contributions made by the author to the Theory of
Sound.      Thus the seventeenth chapter does, indeed, begin with a
long extract from Professor Stokes's paper, " On the Communication
of Vibrations from a Vibrating Body to a Surrounding Gas," in
which he applies his determination of the complete valus of                 (the       \f,

phenomenon,      it may be remarked, had escaped the penetration of
Sir J. Herschell, who " thought that the. mixture of two gases
tending to propagate        sonnd with different velocities might pro

vol. ii.). So far the contents of the chapter are due to Professor
Stokes ;    the remainder       taken from two papers by the author
                                   is
published in the Proceedings of the Mathematical Society — " On

    There are on record several observations of the dip in Calcutta,
which it will be interesting to bring together here.
    The dip appears to have been measured for the first time when
the French corvette 'La Chevrette' visited these waters in 1827,
by M. de Blosseville, who found it then to be*
                                        26° 32' 38".
Ten years later, in 1837, on the occasion of the visit of another
French corvette, 'La Bonite,' to the Hugli river, the dip was
measured at Kalagachia (Diamond Harbour) by the chief Hydro-
grapher, who found it to bet
                                        26° 39' 04",
exhibiting a change of only 0° 06' 26" from the result of the
earlier measurement.
   The next and most recent measurement was made by the brothers
Schlagintweit in March 1856 and in April 1857, in which years it
was found to be respectively             J
                                       28° 06' 43"
                                  and 28° 22' 56".
The same observers found the dip at Jabalpur in December 1855
tobe§                                   28° 31' 08"

the late Captain Basevi, E.E., under the orders of Colonel J. T.

Surveyor-General of India), at 14 stations, extending from 15° 6'

    ON   MOLECULAR ATTRACTION IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE
                  TEMPERATURE OF BODIES.             BY M. LEVY.
     The demonstration which we have given, in our last communica
  tion, of a general law upon the dilatation of bodies rests on the two
  fundamental propositions of thermodynamics, and upon this other
  proposition — that the mutual actions of the molecules of a body are
  independent of their temperatures.
     This last proposition we have assumed as an hypothesis ; we wish
  now to prove that it flows from the first proposition of thermody
 namics, so that our law itself will be found to be built solely upon
 the two propositions which serve as a foundation for that science.
     To justify this assertion, let us conceive any body in motion under
 the influence of :— (1) external forces, F ; (2) mutual actions, /, on
 the nature of which we will make no hypothesis ; (3) a certain quan
 tity of heat received from without.
     Let d'Q be the quantity, positive or negative, of heat received
 during an infinitely short interval of time dt (we will employ the
 characteristic d' for the infinitely small quantities which are not
 exact differentials or which are not known a priori to be so) : a
 portion d'q of this heat is employed for increasing the temperatures
 of the various points of the body; the surplus, or d'Q— 'd'q, is trans
 formed into work, and gives rise to a quantity of work E(d!'Q — d'q),
 E being the mechanical equivalent of heat.
     Suppose that the body describes any complete cycle, which means
not only that all its points describe closed curves and resume their
 velocities at the end of the orbit, but also that they resume their tem
peratures.      If to this cycle we apply the theorem of the vires viva,
we get             .
                  0=
C» denoting an elemental work.
    But, in virtue of the first proposition of thermodynamics,
                                             JVQ=0,
whence
which is equivalent to saying that the quantity under the symbo                f
is the total differential of a certain function
                                                           of ull the variable.-
which resume their values at the end of the cycle — that is, not only
of the coordinates xi, yh zi of the various points of the material
system considered, and which we suppose to be n in number
that i =1,2, 3,... n), but also of
                                                                             (so
                                             the temperatures T, of those

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous    Articles.             467
points.     Thus           zVef--Ed'q=-EdU,          .............       (6)
U    being a function of the 4n variables xt, y(, z,-, Ti.   This function
is no other than that which is called the internal fieat.
     The equation (a), or its equivalent (6), is the only one that can
be directly deduced from the first proposition of the mechanical
theory of heat, if no preconceived idea on the nature of heat be ad
mitted ; and we do not understand the reasonings by which some
have attempted to deduce from it that 2Ce/ is a differential.             It
has certainly been proved that, for certain particular cyles, during
 which the temperature or the quantity of heat received remains
invariable, we have      j ZCe/= 0  ; but from this   it is not permissible
to conclude that ZC'/ is a differential.
     I now say that, whatever idea may be formed of the nature of heat,
the quantity of heat d'q employed to raise the temperatures of the
various points of the body, without displacement of those points, is
necessarily the exact differential of a function of the n variables Ti.
     In fact, the quantity of heat necessary for raising by dTt the
 temperature of a molecule of mass mt is necessarily an expression
 of the fonn nifyfdTi, as yi can only depend on the temperature Ti of
 the molecule and on the specific constants relating to the material
 of which it is composed.
     Therefore the total quantity of heat remaining in the sensible
 9tateis               '
 d'q being thus a differential,   so also is STe/, in virtue of (a)   ; and
 as this sum is an expression    of the form
 containing no term in dTit it cannot but be the differential of a
 function not containing the variables T,, consequently containing
 only the coordinates a;,-, y^ ri.
     It follows from this :— first, that molecular attractions admit a
  function of the forces; secondly, that this function remains the
  same whatever may be the temperatures of the various points of
 the body ; and, thirdly, that "consequently the mutual action of two
 molecules of a body is quite independent of the temperature — which
 completely justifies the law laid down in our last communication,
  and places it among the necessary consequences of the two propo
  sitions of thermodynamics.
      That law, that the pressure of a body heated under constant
  volume varies linearly with the temperature, proves that the empiric
  definition of temperature adopted by Dulong and afterwards by
  Begnault, viz. the pressure of a gaseous mass with constant volume,
  might be easily extended to the case in which, instead of a gaseous
  mass, any other body was in question.
      Finally, without wishing here to draw from this law all the con
  sequences which it admits of, we will nevertheless make the follow
  ing remark : —
      In a previous communication we have sought to discover what
  are the data strictly necessary to be derived from experiment to
  enable one to study a body from the thermodynamic point of view ;

468             Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
 and the importance of this question will be especially apparent if
 we observe that in the best treatises superabundant date are taken
 from observation, even for constructing the simplest theory of all
(that of gases).     We then arrived at a result which can in brief be
                    —
 enunciated thus : To know all the isothermal lines of a body, and
one of its adiabatic lines, is sufficient.
    The law which forms the object of the present investigation con
ducts to the following much more satisfactory and quite unexpected
result: — In order to know all the isothermal lines and all the adiabatic
lines of a body, and consequently to be able to study it completely,
it is necessary and sufficient to know two of its isothermal lines and
 one only of its adiabatic lines.
    In physical terms, one may say that it is sufficient to observe : —
 1st, the dilatation of a body under two different pressures, or, more
generally, for two series of states answering to two curves arbitra
rily traced in the plane of the (pv)'a (which is equivalent to saying
that the co2 observations, of which we spoke at the outset of our
previous communication, are replaced by two simple infinities of
observations) ; 2ndly, one of the specific hea ts, or one particular
pressure only, or, more generally, for a single series of states of the
body corresponding to a curve arbitrarily traced in the plane.
    If we admit, with MM. Clausius and Hirn, that the thermal
 capacity of every substance is a constant, this second series of ob
servations reduces itself to a single observation. — Comptes Bendut

   THE SONOROUS VOLTAMETER.            BY THOMAS A. EDISON, PH.D.
    The sonorous or bubble voltameter consists of an electrolytic cell
with two electrodes— one in free contact with a standard decompo
sable   solution, and the other completely insulated by vulcanized
rubber except two small apertures, one of which gives the solution
free access to the insulated electrode, and the other allows the
escape of bubbles of hydrogen as they are evolved by electrolysis.
With a given current and a given resistance a bubble is obtained
each second, which is seen at the moment of rising, and which at
the same time gives a sound when it reaches the air.          The resist
ance may be reduced so as to give one bubble in one, five, ten, or
fifty seconds, or in as many hours.       I have compared this instru
ment with the ordinary voltameter, and find it much more accurate.
By the use of a very small insulated electrode and but one aperture,
through which both the gas and water current must pass, great in
crease of resistance takes place at the moment when the bubble is
forming ; and just before it rises, a Sounder magnet included within
the battery-circuit opens, closing again when the bubble escapes,
thus allowing by means of a Morse register the time of each bubble
to be recorded automatically.     This apparatus, when properly made,
will be found very reliable and useful in some kinds of work, such
as measuring the electromotive force of batteries &c.       By shunting
the voltameter and using a recorder it becomes a measurer, not only
of the current passing at the time, but also of that which has passed
through a circuit from any source during a given interval. — Silli-
