 I. An algebraical Expression of          the  Values  of Lives, with
    a  Mode of finding the correct Value      of any  Numler of joint
    Lives.    By A Correspondent.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —The      bills of mortality for the year 1815, published in
the newspapers of yesterday, have suggested to me the following
 calculations, which perhaps, from their novelty, you may think
worthy a place in your Magazine.
                        I am, sir,
                               Your very obedient servant,
Loudon, Jan. 2, 1816.                                    A. B. C. D.
    In making calculations from the registers of the duration of
 lives, it has not been usual to attempt to represent the results
of a whole table by a single formula, although such a simplifi
 cation would afford great advantages in the solution of a variety
of problems.     As an instance of this mode of treating the sub
ject, we may take the bills of mortality for the year now elapsed,
and by reducing the numbers into the form of a diagram, and
observing the different flexures of the curve resulting from them,
we may ascertain the nature of the terms proper to constitute
 the required expression ; and calling the age x, the annual
deaths will appear to be     —.—         + -000401a; --0000042x%
 without any very material        error: at least with incomparably
 greater accuracy    than is obtained  by the rough approximation of
 supposing an equal annual mortality in a given number of per-

sons as long as any of them remains alive; and much more
nearly than the registers of a metropolis agree with those which
have been kept in the country.           It would be very easy to correct
the expression from the average of the registers of a number of
years; and the formula might also be adapted with little diffi
culty to the mortality observed in any other situation.
   In order to find the number of persons who have died during
any given portion of the period of the longest human life, we
must combine the expression for the mortality with the fluxion

given   age. It has   sometimes been thought sufficiently accurate to
estimate the value of a life by the period at which half the persons
who have attained the given age are likely to remain alive: this
affords a true criterion of the greatest probability of the dura
tion of one life, but not of the correct mean value of a number
of lives; since this value can only be found bv dividing the ag
gregate duration of all the lives in question by their number :
now this aggregate duration is represented by the area of the
curve having the ages and the numbers living, for its ordinates

   The advantage of this method of calculation is strongly ex
emplified in the determination of the value of the joint continu
ance of two or more lives, which may he obtained by means of
the quadrature of a curve having its ordinates in the join-, ratio
of the survivors at the time expressed by the absciss; the cor
rected area being divided by the product of the numbers of sur
vivors at its commencement, which obviously expresses the num
ber of all the possible combinations of their lives, as the area
does the aggregate duration of those combinations.
   For this purpose it will be convenient to represent the num
ber of deaths by the formula •38 + -002x*--00000l37xi, which
will be sufficiently accurate for anv age exceeding 10 years ; and
if we make a = 62, £ = -0002, and c=-00000137, and call the
two ages x and x + n, the product will be d + ex + fxz + gx* +
fix* + ixs + for6, where d — a1 — abn1 + ncn%, e=3acn1 — 2aln,

h = fr—oicn + 3cJra% i — 'ic*n— 2bc, and fc = cJ; and the area
of the curve will        be   dx 4-          — ex1   +   —   fx1 + 4-             +     t   hx* +
— ix"'   -f   ~- kx"1,   which must            be found for the given age, and for
x -f  n = 98 or 1 00, and the difference, divided                              by the   product,
will show the value of the joint lives.
     But in pursuing the calculation for a greater number of lives,
it would    be necessary to assume a still simpler expression for
the number of deaths, such as rnx, m being                                      or from -— to
—     according to circumstances,                    retaining the more accurate ex
pression for the elder lives ; and taking for the age of the younger
x—p, and for the number of the survivors l—mx + mp, which
may be called q — mx: and the former product might be mul
tiplied by this for the case of three lives, and the area found as
before    Indeed this expression may be employed for the younger
of two lives without material inaccuracy, the product becoming
aq —amx-~ bqx* + (cq + bm) xi — cmx*, and the area aqx —

the given age, and the difference divided by the product.
    When two lives are equal, the mean value of their joint con
tinuance, thus approximated,       becomes exactly two-thirds of
that of a single life; of three, two-fourths or a half; of 4, two-
fifths, of 5 two-sixths, and so forth : whence also we obtain, for
the value of the longest of two lives, — of that of a single life,
and for the longest of three                           ;   and we may continue the series
 at pleasure by adding at each step 2 to the numerator and 1 to
the denominator.
    According to the usual method of estimating the value of three
joint lives from that of two lives, one of which is of equal value
with two of the three taken together, the result, in the case of
equal lives, is about                ~    of the value of              a single   life, instead of
half ; that        is,
              almost    per cent.   4                      too much, an error        by   no means
to be neglected in practice.                       It      will be easy to obtain a more
correct approximation, from the                            principles here explained, em
ploying any tables of the value                            of lives that may be preferred.

found in a similar manner.       The usual deduction must be made
for periodical payments, whether annual or quarterly: and a
slight correction may sometimes be required, on account of the
different effects of annual and continual interest ; but both these

tion of half a payment from the present value, thus computed,
will give us the corrected value with considerable accuracy.

    II.    On the Cosmogony       of Moses.            By A Correspondent.
                                 To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — Like           your correspondent          Homo*, I have                been    unable
to discover, among the merits of Cuvier's Essay on the Theory
of the Earth, that accordance with the Mosaic cosmogonv which
the preface of Professor Jameson had taught me to anticipate.
I    confess, too, ^hat this accordance has not been rendered much
more perceptible to my understanding, either by Homo's pro
posed reading of the beginning of Genesis, or by the subsequent
observations of Dr. Prichardf, in support of the term day be
ing, in the Mosaic account, equivalent to an indefinite period.
   " In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth:
and the earth was without form, and void, and darkness was
upon the face of the deep."    If it be supposed, with Homo, that
this act of divine energy was an indefinite period antecedent
to what is called the six days' creation, there will, as he ob
serves, be no scriptural objection to the adoption of the belief,
that the earth may have " thus existed" the " thousands of
years that preceded the history of man."      Homo's reading thus
affords time for the deposition of the primitive rocks, as well as
for whatever else may have taken place previous to the gathering
together of the waters, and the appearance of the dry land on
the third day; but there its explanatory power expires, leaving
Cuvier's J "thousands of animals that never ivere contempo
raneous with man," together with his various deluges, to be re
conciled to the Mosaic account by some other hypothesis.
   As what Homo calls Bishop Horsley's hypothebii of a slower
revolution may by some be deemed sufficient for this purpose,
I must beg leave to offer a few observations relative to it. In
the preface already spoken of, Professor Jameson says, that
" there are indeed many physical considerations which render it
probable that the motions of the earth may have been slower
during the time of its formation than after it was formed     and                      ||,
consequently that the day, or period between morning and
evening, may have then been indefinitely longer than            at                    it     is
present."   From  this passage  there  the  reference  have
                                                      is    given              I
in the margin, to Bishop Horsley's Sermons. To them turned,                        I

  10                 On the Cosmogony      of Motes.
 which render it prolable," I found only a well-reasoned refuta
 tion of the conjecture that, in the Mosaic history of the creation,
 the word day means an indefinite portion of time.         Towards
 the close of the argument, the bishop says, " By what descrip
 tion could the word day be more expressly limited to its literal
 and common meaning, as denoting that portion of time which
    is measured and consumed by the earth's revolution on her
    axis ? That this revolution was performed in the same space of
    time in the beginning of the world as now, I would not over
    confidently affirm,"     This last is the only sentence in the ser
   mon, that connects Bishop Horsley's name with the supposition
    of a slower revolution ; which I shall now consider a little on
   the ground of its intrinsic value.       The rotation of the planets
   on their axis seems exempt from the accelerations and retarda
   tions to which all their other motions are subject.         No inequa
   lity has  ever  been detected in the  rotary motion  of the earth ; and
   the relation between its polar and equatorial diameters shows,
   that when it assumed its present figure the centrifugal force of
   its particles, and consequently the rapidity of its diurnal revolu
   tion, could not be much different from what they are at present.
   But it may be said, that when the rotary impulse was given, the
   matter of the earth constituted the shell or crust of a hollow
  sphere ; that afterwards this crust, being broken, fell in towards
  its centre, and formed a spheroid of diminished magnitude ;
  and that, in consequence, the rotary motion of the spheroid must
   (in a certain proportion to its diminution) be more rapid than
  the original diurnal revolution of the hollow sphere.          That an
  acceleration of the earth's rotation must have resulted from such
  a catastrophe is mathematically demonstrable ; but besides that
  the supposition is wholly gratuitous, it would give no effectual
  support to the hypothesis, unless a magnitude were given to
  the original hollow sphere, which the most visionary imagination
 would scarcely dare to assign.         Admitting, however, for a mo
 ment this hypothesis of a slower revolution, I would ask, Of what
  duration was the earth's primitive diurnal rotation ? Was it one,
  thousand, or one hundred, of our years ? Although the greatest
 of these periods would, perhaps, be too short for the purpose
 assigned  it,    let us take only half of the least, and inquire what
 would be the state of the vegetable and animal world deprived
 of light and heat during Jiue-and-twenty years         P    for such,it
 would appear, must have been their condition, at least after the
fourth day, on the supposition of the diurnal revolution of the
 earth being equal to no more than fifty of our years.
      There remains to be noticed the conjecture often made, that
 in the Mosaic cosmogony the word day signifies an indefinite
portion of time.     This conjecture    seems   completely    disproved
                                                                     by

                     On the Cosmogony       of Moses.                       1 1
by Bishop Horsley : but with relation to Dr. Prichard's argu
ment in its favour, drawn from the genius of the Hebrew lan
guage, I would ask, whether the Hebrews ever understood the
word day, as used in the first chapter of Genesis, to signify an
indefinite portion of time ? If they did not, is it probable that
the true sense of this Hebrew word, as there employed, should
always have remained unknown to them, and after a lapse of
some thousand years, when they had long ceased to exist as a
nation, be discovered by the ingenuity of modern criticism ?
Acquiescing in the correctness of the remark, that the Hebrew
word which we translate day, was often used by the Hebrews,
and even by Moses himself, to designate an indefinite length of
time, the just inference seems to be, that, on account of this
usage of the term, Moses, when speaking of the Creation, thought
it necessary to circumscribe the length of each day by its natural
boundary.     To show therefore that day used unrestrictedly, was
sometimes understood by the Hebrews to signify an indefinite
period, instead of strengthening Dr. Prichard's conclusion, tends
directly to its subversion ; unless he can further show, that the
 word in Hebrew was ever so understood when the extent of its
signification was expressly limited to the duration of an evening
 and a morning, or to the decay of light and its return, as Bishop
 Horsley observes the words of Moses literally import.
    An auxiliary argument of Dr. Prichard's            is, that    would be
                                                                   it
            a
imputing palpable absurdity          to  Moses   to suppose   him   speaking
 of days in the literal meaning of the word, before the creation of
the sun.     But may   it  not be asked, whether the imputation of
 absurdity would be greatly diminished            by    Dr. Prichard's      al
 ternative of making him include an indefinite period of great
 length, in an evening and        a   morning?        In this view, there
fore,  the  assumed figurative sense does         not  seem to have much
 advantage over the literal.       With the indulgence, however, of a
little of the privilege of conjecture, so freely used              others on
                                                                  by
 this subject,  it   will not be difficult to clear the literal se?ise
 from its apparent inconsistency.
    Darkness being merely the absence of light,              it   impossible
                                                                  is
that they could ever coexist in the same place, so as to be sub
ject, like substances in union, to an actual division. When,
 therefore, after the creation of light, Moses says that God                di
vided the " light from the darkness," he cannot be literally un
 derstood:   but we may suppose the matter of light at the mo
 ment of its creation diffused through the immensity of space
 previously occupied    by darkness, and that the dividing the light
from the darkness consisted in collecting       it    into one great tem
 porary  reservoir.    Now   after  this   aggregation    of the matter oi"
light  on  the first day, provided     its position  were   not in the pro

                             To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —   It  is with great pleasure that I recognise in pages
 465 and 6, (though under the signature N. J. VV.) a communi
 cation " on the localities of coal," to be from the able pen of
 Nathaniel John Winch, esq., who so very kindly answered for
 mer queries put by me on the same subject, in pages 198 and
 295 of your xlvth volume ; and I am by this circumstance em
 boldened, to again trouble him as follows; viz.
    1st. Has it been ascertained, by actually tracing the Bocks
 and strata on the surface (as Mr. Smith has done in his Map),
 or by a sufficiently extensive and careful comparison of the
successions   oj beds and organic remains therein imbedded, in
the distant situations of Alston- Moor, and others W of By well,
and N of the Coquet River, that the individual thin and nearly
useless seams of Crow Coal* in the former situation, thicken and
improve in quality, so as to become in the latter and more
northerly situations, tolerably good seams of workable Coal?
    2d. Do the over-lying or mountain caps of Basalt in the
northern and western parts of Northumberland, appear to be
unconformable       f
                   to the Strata beneath them ?, that     do theyis,
lie upon the edges of their substrata, and have no place in the
series of strata to the east of their sites Or, are they detached
                                               ?
parts or hummocks of the great whin sill (Forster fath. 423 to
437)?: whose continuous basset-edge would in such case be
traceable, from Dufton-fell and Caldron-snout (p. 41), north
eastward to the sea.
   3d. Can     itbe depended on, that small shells of Mtiscles
(whether of salt or fresh water origin, do not ask, because this,

stone, accompanying these Basaltic Caps, or otherwise, in an uncumform-

of this district (p. 466); or even " in most places where iron
stone is found in the shales, not only in the Newcastle Coal-
formation, but also in the metalliferous Limestone district, upon
which it rests," (p. 364 vol. xlv.)  ?
    A  particular answer, mentioning as many places (and if prac
ticable the strata also, with reference to Forster's Section) as
possible, where such shells have been actually found, will infi
nitely more oblige the querist, than any general answer whatever
to this question.
    4th. In the bpreing for Coals at Dinsdale on the Tees (p. 466),
were any real Coal-seams, however thin, actually penetrated ?
or were ever real Coal-measures or metals, proved in this place ?.
    The querist hopes his solicitude on this head may be pardoned
by Mr. W., when he mentions, that to him, when some years
ago hastily viewing this district, Dinsdale seemed to be situated
above the magnesian Lime, on a part of the British Series,
wherein no Coal-seams have yet to his knowledge been proved.
    5th. Was it near IVaivfleet on the Lincolnshire Coast, that
fragments of a black (brown?) Coal resembling that of Bovey
 were washed on shore, together with bituminous Shale containing
 numerous Shells ? The querist has been induced, for two rea
 sons, thus to frame his question ; first, because Mr. W. intimates,
 that the same kind of shale is a substratum to the Chalk, which
 the strata S of Wainfleet must be ; and nest, because the foot
 of the hill on the west side of Bolingbi oke in the range of these
 strata, produces such gray, bituminous, shelly, shale, and near
 thereto on the NE of Rathby, they were boreing in search of
 Coals, at the time he visited this district, in the chmch Clay ;
 the same part of the series of British strata, in which, at another
 time, he found the thin Coal-formation of the Yorkshire east
 moorlands (p. 466) to be situated.         Whereas Louth appeared
 clearly to him to stand, on the top of all the Chalk Strata: if
  therefore any such beds of shale resembling Coal-measures,
 especially seams of Coal, were there found, in or near to the
 London Clay (on which Alford stands), it would prove a fact
 quite new to the querist: except perl;aps, that he once heard,
 without giving credence thereto, that Coals appear above the
  Chalk, somewhere to the east of the Medway near the southern
  shore of the Thames ?
     Not doubting Mr. W's friendly reception of the above queries
  and hints, or that the answers to be expected thereupon will in
  terest many,

 of his own.       Icertainly cannot suppose that this ingenious
 writer had an opportunity of seeing any of the instruments of
 this kind which had been constructed under my direction.        So
 early as the  end  of  the year 1805,    sent   drawing

instrument maker, London.         In 1806, one of the instruments
made for me        Messrs. Miller and Adie, Edinburgh, was ex
                   by
amined     by Professor Playfair    and since that time

description of     anew optical instrument which he calls " Micro-

                                                        :          for    is                 ;
it   is
      expressly mentioned   in my paper, that  my   micrometer   con
sists of    number of parallel lines drawn upon

glass.
   Soon after had formed the design of this instrument,
                     I                                      ap                               I
plied to the late Mr. Coventry of Southwark, for     set of his                     a
micrometers.    Mr. C. had none at that time, but promised to
send me    set, which
                a         never received though
                                I                 waited for them     I
upwards of two years.       But, not being willing to give up the
plan of my instrument, without trying how far       might be ren           it
dered useful          in
                  practice,    undertook to draw lines upon glass
                                           1
myself and after an infinite number of unsuccessful attempts,
           ;
I succeeded so far as to draw parallel lines -roVoth of an inch
apart, which being intersected at right angles          equal lines             by
form minute squares, each one-millionth part of          superficial               a
inch. Whence        concluded that lines drawn,
                          I                          the same me           by
thod, at T^-otli of an inch distant would be sufficiently accurate
for my purpose.
 I    am surprised to find so little use made of Mr. Coventry's
glasses for,;      they were properly applied to optical instruments,
                     if
micrometers might be made that would supersede the use of all
others.     For measuring small objects before the microscope,
these micrometers are unquestionably the best, both for precision
and readiness of application       and they may be applied to tele
                                               ;
scopes    for  measuring   small angles with equal advantage.     To
illustrate this position, let the second example be taken from
p.  12S, vol. xxxviii. of The Philosophical Magazine.
    " The magnifying power of the telescope 45 times.                 is

     "Micrometer divisions -pro'li of an inch distant.
    " Each division subtends an angle at the eye = 30".
    " One inch of the eye-tube          .      .   is = 52"."

    But       the divisions of the micrometer were drawn f^th of
               if
an inch distant, which may be done with great exactness         Then,                    ;
     Each division would subtend an angle                            ..        = \° = 15''.

 consequence, since the eye-tube is never drawn out further than
 -A-ths of an inch; for 2-6" x.6 ( = 15-6") is nearly = one divi
 sion of the micrometer.
     From the comparative micrometer measures taken at the Ob
 servatory, Armagh, by the Rev. Dr. J. A. Hamilton, it appears
 that the divided object-glass micrometer and the wire-micrometer
 are each liable to an error of 3" in taking the sun's diameter*.
     On the divided object-glass micrometer, Dr. Hamilton ob
 serves, " its imperfections are ; that, to different eyes, and under
 different circumstances of the same eye, the length of the focal
 distance, that suits distinct vision, will vary, and of course the
 quantity" of the measures given by the scale is liable to a small
 variation.
     "The principal        defects of the wire-micrometer are ; the dif
 ficulty   of  judging accurately of bisections, or contacts of the
 fine   wires,   by the limbs to be measured; and the impossibility
 of observing any diameter, except one perpendicular to the
 equator."
     In the construction of my micrometer, I endeavoured to avoid
all optical illusions, and all mechanism that might produce any
 sensible error.

V. On the Nature and Combinations of a newly-discovered vege
     table Acid; with Observations on the malic Acid, and Sug
    gestions on the State in which Acids may have previously
    existed in Vegetables.          By M. Donovan, Esq. Commum

                      Observations on the      Malic Acid.
In     1785, during an examination of different fruits and berries,
Scheele discovered that gooseberries, beside lemon acid, con
tained one of a peculiar nature : this he afterwards found to
exist in apples, without, as he thought, a sensible admixture of
any other.        On this account he gave it the name of apple acid,
or malic acid.
     He also ascertained, that by the action of nitrous acid on sugar,
                            * Irish Transactions,  vol. x,
                                                                  a substance

               of a newly -discovered    vegetable      Acid.         17
a substance is produced, which shows no traces of nitric acid,
yet unites and forms a soluble salt with lime, " it therefore is
not the oxalic acid." By some other experiments he found that
an acid is produced " which does not differ in the least from
the properties of the apple acid, and is accordingly the same."
    This acid he detected in a great variety of vegetable juices.
Since that period, Vauquelin has extended the catalogue; but
of all other plants, it is most abundantly contained in the Sem-
pervivum Tectorum.
    Scheele's process for obtaining malic acid is as follows.
"  Saturate the juice of apples, whether ripe or unripe, with car
bonate of potash ; add solution of acetate of lead until it cease
to produce a precipitation.      To the edulcorated precipitate, add
as much dilute vitriolic acid, as is necessary to give the mixture
a perfectly acid taste, without any sweetness*."
    There are several objections to this process, all of which seem
to have considerable weight.         In the preceding pages I have
shown, that the juice of apples, whether ripe or unripe, always
contains two acids of very different properties.       By the above
process these acids are not separated ; they are in fact found in
what is supposed to be the resulting pure malic acid, and it is
impossible, without the most complicated processes, to obtain
 this substance in the insulated form.
    The precipitation of the lead by means of sulphuric acid ap
pears to be objectionable.       I have often attempted to adjust
the proportion of the latter substance, so as to throw down all
the lead, without leaving any free sulphuric acid but I uniformly
failed : and it is evident that, if not impossible, it is exceedingly
difficult and troublesome.
    Scheele also attempted to obtain malic acid from malate of
lime, by means of sulphuric acid, but found " the mode rather
difficult, as the acid would not let the calx fall completely."
Vauquelin observed the same thing.
    The last process proposed by Scheele, is to distil equal parts
of weak nitric acid and sugar, until the mixture become brown,
which is a sign that all the nitrous acid has been abstracted: the
oxalic acid formed, is to be separated by lime-water, and the
remaining acid to be saturated with carbonate of lime. The so
lution is to be filtered, the filtered liquor to be mixed with alco
hol, and the coagulum thus obtained, is to be edulcorated with
new portions of alcohol.      The coagulum is then to be dissolved
in water, and mixed with a solution of acetate of lead : a pre
cipitate falls, which is to be treated with sulphuric acid, in the
 manner already directed.
    No one who has not gone through this process, can fully con-

18                  On the Nature and Comlinations
ceive the difficulty and expense of it : and I have found that the
acid obtained is variable in its nature.     In one case I obtained
an acid, which, when mixed with solution of acetate of lead, did
not at first produce any effect, but at length slowly deposited a
precipitate.    The heating of another portion of the acid with
carbonate of lime, produced a separation of a black powder,
which possessed the properties of charcoal.        There were also
many other peculiarities ; and the combined effect of all was to
convince me, that great differences exist between the acid ob
tained in this manner, and that obtained by other processes.
    The experiments of Vauquelin satisfied him that the acid which
is combined with lime in the Sempsrvivum Tectorum, is the true
malic: and all my trials convince me, that it does not contain
even the least quantity of the sorbic.    Since then, by the means
generally employed,    we do not  obtain malic  acid, the only alter
native is to adopt the hitherto neglected process of Vauquelin ;
and it will be found that his process affords the acid with greater
ease, and in much greater purity, than any other.       The method
of detaching the acid from the malate of lead by sulphuric acid
 is, as we have seen, difficult    and the criterion of the taste
                                   ;                                     is
liable to this fallacy, that as the sourness increases, the sweet
ness decreases.     There will, on this account, be a period when
the latter will disguise the former, and yet the lead will be still
present.      would therefore suggest the substitution of sulphu
               I
retted hydrogen in place of sulphuric acid.
     If were required to obtain malic acid exceedingly pure, and
       it
still more divested of vegetable matter, the following process
may be .adopted.
   The juice of Sempervivum Tectorum          is   to be evaporated to
two-thirds, and, after standing some hours,         it    to be filtered,
                                                         is
and mixed with an equal quantity of alcohol.             The coagulum
is to be separated        by
                         the filter, edulcorated with fresh portions
of alcohol, and dried     the air, lest any adhering alcohol should
                           in
impede its subsequent solution.       The mass     is  then to be dis
solved in water, mixed with solution of acetate of lead, and
the precipitate collected on a filter.       After being well edulco
rated from any superfluous acetate     of   lead, the precipitate   is to
be boiled. for fifteen minutes with    alittle less of dilute sulphuric
 acid than   sufficient to saturate the oxide of lead: and for this
               is
 part of the process, the criterion of sweetness will very well
answer the propose.      The whole    to be set aside for some days,
                                       is
and, during this period,     a small  quantity of sulphate of lead
which the malic acid held dissolved, will be deposited.           The
liquor    now to be filtered, and in order to separate the last
          is
portions of lead,     astream of sulphuretted hydrogen          to be
                                                               is
transmitted through         the black precipitate
                           it  :                       to be filtered
                                                         is

                 of a newly -discovered vegetable  Acid.            19
   off, and the liquor should be boiled in a vessel freely exposed,
   until paper moistened with acetate of lead is no longer blackened
  by the discharged vapour.      This acid is the purest that can be
  obtained ; it retains a slight odour of the gas, but even this is
  destroyed by exposure to the air for a few days.
      Vauquelin observes, that malic acid thus obtained is nearly co
  lourless: his was therefore diluted.     I have found that it be
  comes perfectly brown by concentration:     and I have decomposed
  and recomposed malate of lead several times, using each time
  the same specimen of malic acid ; yet so obstinately did the co
  louring matter adhere, that it was always found in the resulting
  acid. Thus, as far as we know, this acid cannot be procured
  free from colour ; and the nearest approximation is that obtained
  by Vauquelin's process.
  Suggestions concerning the State in which Acids may previously
                      have existed in Vegetables.
      I have sometimes indulged in the supposition, that the vege-     -
  table acids are not primarily formed by the immediate union cf
  their elements, but that they may have previously existed in a
  definite combination, called the bitter principle.    It is possible
  that this principle may be a compound basis, which by uniting
- to oxygen, or by undergoing more complicated processes, might
   change its nature so far as to become an acid.     The whole is a
  mere conjecture, and perhaps deserving of little consideration ;
  the facts, however, which suggested it may be noticed.
      The sweetness of any vegetable juice has been generally at
  tributed. to a sweet principle called sugar.   In the same manner
  it has been lately supposed, that bitterness depends on a bitter
  principle, which, although variously disguised, is always identical.
  Dr. Thomson has shown, that when water is digested over
  quassia, and afterwards evaporated to dryness, a transparent
   substance is obtained, which differs in its properties from all
  other vegetable principles: this he considers as the bitter prin
  ciple, and, I believe, with very great justice. I found that the
  liquor obtained by digestion, although slightly coloured, was
  transparent even to the end of the evaporation.       The resulting
  mass was nearly transparent, and minute in quantity, considering
  the proportion of quassia employed ; and such was its bitterness,
   that a particle placed on the tongue, which could not have ex
   ceeded yL-th of a grain, diffused an intense bitterness over the
   whole mouth and fauces.
      This matter was heated with nitric acid ; it dissolved with
   effervescence, and the bitterness was no longer sensible.      The
   remaining substance formed a precipitate in acetate of lead,
   which possessed all the properties of malate of lead : and it
                                  B 2                        appeared

20 On the Nature,      &c. of a newly -discovered    vegetable Acid.
appeared that no other than the malic acid was produced. With
this experiment the following agrees in a remarkable manner.
    Five ounces of white sugar, and ah equal weight of very strong
nitric acid were mixed in a retort.      Without the application of
external heat the action commenced, and soon became violent.
When cold, the residual matter was found to be thick and tena
cious 5 its taste was sour, and extremely bitter.      The malic acid
being abstracted from a portion of this by means of lime, it was
found that the bitterness, now no longer disguised by acidity,
had become intense.       The other portion, which had not been
saturated with lime, by being treated with more nitric acid, lost
all its bitterness, and oxalic acid was formed.       In this experi
ment it appears, that by some action of nitrous acid on sugar, a
bitter substance and malic acid were produced together ; that
by the further action of nitrous acid, the bitter substance dis
appeared, and acid appeared in its stead.
    The foregoing conjectures correspond also with the fact, that-
by the action of certain substances on each other, the bitter
principle is evolved at the same time with those acids which I
suppose to have been produced from that compound basis: and
the appearance of both at the same time may be accounted for
by admitting that the conversion was not complete.            Thus, if
alcohol be distilled with nitrous acid, a liquor is produced which
has a sweet taste.      If this liquor be re-distilled with another
portion of acid, a bitter liquor comes over.        And if this bitter
liquor be distilled a third time with a fresh portion of nitrous
acid, crystals of oxalic acid make their appearance in the re
siduum.      This series of changes bears a striking resemblance to
that produced by the action of nitrous acid on sugar.
    Haussman observed, that when lytric acid is digested with
indigo, a very bitter substance results, to which Welther gave the
name of Amer: in this process, oxalic acid is also formed.
    The vegetable acids are even formed by the action of nitrous
 acid on animal substances ; in the instance of muscle we obtain
 the above-mentioned Amer with oxalic acid. , In bile the bitter
 principle is already formed ; when acted on by nitrous acid,
 oxalic acid is produced.
    On examination we shall not be at a loss to find operations
 analogous to some of the preceding, taking place naturally in
 the vegetable kingdom.       Jhe Pyrus Malus or common crab-
 apple, while young, is very bitter, and has little sourness : as the
 fruit advances towards maturity, the taste becomes propor
 tionately sour, and the bitterness diminishes.     The young berries
 of the Sorbus aucuparia also are bitter, contain but one acid,
 and even that in small quantity: when the berry is ripe, it con
 tains two acids, the combined quantity of both is considerable,
                                                                   but

           Rules for ascertaining the Strength     of Materials.    21
but the bitterness has in a great degree given place to a coarse
 astringency.
    It is not improbable, that the bitterness produced in all the
 foregoing cases should be owing to the formation of the same
bitter principle: and its constant conjunction with a vegetable
 acid, seems to show that there is some very intimate connexion
 between them, at present unknown.
    The preceding observations are offered as mere conjecture ;
and I am fully sensible of what little consideration should be
attached to them : they are not however entirely devoid of pro
bability. An hypothesis is below the dignity of a system which
is founded on the indestructible basis of experiment : and even
though it be supported by the coincidence of admitted facts, by
direct analogies, and by the correspondence of received opinions,
it should nevertheless be the beginning and not the end of know
ledge.
      VI.   Rules for    ascertaining the Strength  of Materials.
        \
                             To    Mr. Tillock.
Sir, -—The following rules for ascertaining the strength of
materials are, I believe, new, and if you think them worthy of a
place in your Magazine, the insertion of them will oblige
                                     Yours, &c.  .
                                                              T. T.
    Put   f=   the direct cohesive force of a square inch of the ma
                terial ;
          b = the breadth ;
          d m the depth, or the dimension in the direction of the
                pressure ; and,
          I = the length.
   Then the lateral or transverse strength of a rectangular pris
matic beam or bar, is
             ~y- if     supported at one end,
      and            if supported at botfh ends.
   The lateral strength      of a square beam or bar, when its dia
gonal is placed verticallv,     is
             -—-    if supported   at one end,

22      Rules for ascertaining        tlie Strength   of Materials.
           and    =—     if supported     at both ends.
   In this case d is the diagonal.              The strength of a square
beam is the least when the force is in the direction of the dia
gonal.    The lateral strength of a solid cylinder is
                          if supported     at one end,
            and   ~— if supported at both ends.
   In this case   r is the radius, and p = 3'14159 &c.
   The lateral strength of        a tube or   hollow cylinder, is
                  ~jgT—^ if        supported at one end.
           and •i£2£pl9        if supported   at both ends ;
   R and r being the radii of the exterior and interior circles.
The section of the tube is supposed to retain its circular form
at the time of fracture.         It has been said that we cannot deter
mine from theory the proper thickness of material for the tube,
so that its form may not be sensibly altered by the pressure ; but
this is a mistake, for by a very simple investigation the thickness
can be determined sufficiently near for any practical purpose.
   The lateral strength of a triangular beam or bar is
                                 if supported   at one end,
                              d
           and  .  225™fb         jf SUpported   at both ends.
   In this case b is the base of the triangle, and d the height
or the dimension in the direction of the pressure. The strength
is the same when the edge is uppermost as it is when the op
posite side is uppermost.          The strength of a solid cylinder, pil
lar, or column, to resist a force acting in the direction of its
axis is
                   5 el' '
                  ~^rt       where    e  is the   extension of the mate-
rial at the time of fracture.             The diameter of a column may
be so great in proportion to its length, that a less force than that
necessary to bend it, would crush it.
   The force necessary to crush a homogeneous solid cylinder is
8/pf.
   The last rule has not yet been compared with experiment,
indeed I do not know of any to compare it with.                A set of ex
periments, on this kind of fracture, would be useful, not only
to the architect and engineer, but also to the philosopher,            "  It
                                                                           is

is wonderful,"      says Professor     Robison,    " that in a matter of such
unquestionable        importance the public has not enabled some
persons of judgement to make proper trials;" and we cannot
without regret remark, that nothing worth notice has been added
to our experimental knowledge since Robison wrote his excel
lent articles on the Strength of Materials.

show the weight that would crush cylinders of different kinds of
materials.

VII.    Further Re7narks on Dr. Bradley's Theorem for com
    puting the Astronomic Refraction. By T. S. Evans, LL.D.
    F.L.S.
The      attention of astronomers            has lately been   much occupied
with the astronomic refraction             ;  and perhaps no other subject
 is so worthy their notice at this moment, since it is the greatest
 obstacle of any, to improvements and accuracy iu that science.
 Much has lately been done towards an exact determination of
 its quantity at all altitudes above the horizon, by the use of the
 modern circles of Itamsden, Troughton, and other eminent in
 strument-makers.          The great care with which these have been
 divided, and may be . adjusted ; the minuteness with which
 they may be read off, by means of micrometers, placed in the
 microscopes ; and the certainty with which the object can be
 bisected, in the field of view, by using cobwebs, or perhaps the
 minute platina wires lately made by the ingenious Dr. Wollaston,
 give us great reason to hope, that with the zeal of our present
 best observers much time will not elapse, before the difficulties
 now met with in discovering the quantity of the refraction, will
 in a great measure, if not wholly, be removed.
    Of all the different formulae that have hitherto been published,
                                     B  4                                    it

24          Further Remarks on      Dr. Bradley's    Theorem
it  does not appear that any one of them at present will give the
true refraction nearer than about six or seven seconds at ten
degrees of altitude, and most of them reach to that extent with
the same limits of error.       It is therefore unnecessary to have
recourse to the long and laborious methods that have been of
fered, when more simple ones will effect the purpose with equal
exactness.      Our attention should rather be directed to the
improvement of some one of the number, that is easily com
puted so as to extend its application and bring it to correspond
better in observations made at low altitudes. But if it should be
found that the law of its progression does not admit of being ex
 pressed by a formula, we must endeavour to remedy the defect by
means of a table, that will give its|quantity at all necessary intervals.
    According to the theory published by Mr. Thomas Simpson,
in his Mathematical Dissertations, and further improved by Dr.
 Bradley, which, with modern determinations of the coefficients, is
 the one now most commonly used in England, on account of its
 simplicity, the equation for the astronomic refraction is
         p X   tang.(z.D-m-) x        (l  +
                                              |) x (^l)
 which is evidently of the indeterminate kind, since it contains
 no less than four unknown quantities, lhat require to be disco
 vered from other, sources.      These afe p, n, r, and m ; of which
 the first, p, is the refraction at 45° of altitude of the object above
 the horizon, taken at any given standard of temperature and
 density of the atmosphere.       The second, n, is some multiple of
 the third, or mean refraction r, by which the zenith distance of
 the object is to be diminished before its tangent is taken out of
 the tables.
     From a comparison of the theory with some accurate obser
 vations lately taken, I have had reason to think that n is not
 a constant multiplier of r, as has hitherto been supposed, but
 that it varies, according to some function of the altitude of the
 object above the horizon.                       x
     The fourth of these unknown coefficients, m, is the expansion
 of a volume of air, for each degree of ascent of Fahrenheit's
 thermometer ; and the same comparison abovementioned, in con
junction with the latest and most exact experiments of two justly
 celebrated modern chemists has also furnished some strong rea
 sons for doubting, whether the expansion for each degree of the
 thermometer is the same for all states of temperature, from the
 freezing to the boiling point.
    This inquiry may, perhaps, by some persons be deemed in
 teresting, as it points out a subject where the determinations
  of the chemist are corroborated by those of the astronomer.
                                                                   These

                for   computing      the Astronomic Refraction.             25
These two branches of philosophy               are apparently very distinct
from each other, and separated by boundaries that do not
at first sight appear even to approximate.                   It is therefore
pleasing to      discover     a case  wherein   one  of them   is capable of
affording assistance to the other ; as it shows their mutual de
pendence, and consequently the advantages of cultivating and
improving at the same time all the departments of human know
ledge.
     By consulting Dr. Thomson's valuable Treatise of Chemistry,
vol. i. ft. 494, on the expansion of atmospheric air, we read as
follows     :
      "  From the experiments            of Dalton and Gay-Lussac it ap
pears that all gaseous bodies whatever undergo the same ex
 pansion by the same addition of heat, supposing them placed
under similar circumstances.              Gay-Lussac found that air by be
 ing heated from 32° to 2 12°, expanded from 1000 to 1375 parts
 under a pressure =0-76 of a metre ( = 29'92152 English inches).
 Mr. Dalton found that 1000 parts of air, heated from 55° to
 212% expanded to 1325 parts.                 He found also, that the ex
 pansion      of  air is  very nearly equable ; or that the same increase
 of bulk takes place, by the same addition of caloric, at all dif
 ferent temperatures.             The expansion from 55° to 133}°, was
  167 parts; and from 133} to 212- it was 158 parts.                    He has
 also shown that the expansion of air follows a regular geometric
 progression, if we suppose that mercury expands as the square
 of the temperature from the freezing point : and he has rendered
 it probable, that the expansion of water and mercury is as tl e
  square of the temperature of each, reckoning from their respec
  tive freezing points.           He finds, if this law be supposed, that
  the expansion of water and mercury corresponds : hence he in
  fers, that all liquids follow the same law ; or that they expand
  as the square of the temperature, from the freezing point of
   each."
       If we reduce these experiments to the same standard, and
   then bring their results into one point of view, they will be as
   follows :
       First : M. Gay-Lussac found that air by being heated from
   323 to 212° expanded from 1000 parts to 1375 parts.                  There-
                                              375
   fore for    1 80 degrees it expanded           of the whole  : consequently
   as    180:             1 :          = °'002083 the expansion        for each
               S0o:     :
                               155555
   degree of the thermometer when taken throughout the whole
   extent of the scale from the freezing to the boiling point.
        Secondly : Mr. Dalton found that air when heated from 55°
    to 212° expanded from 1000 to 1325 parts: therefore, as
                                                                           157:

   part of the scale reckoning from 55° to 212°
      Thirdly: Mr. Dalton found that when the air was heated from
  55° to 1331 only, it expanded from 1000 to 1167 parts; con
  sequently as 78-5       : ~ :: f~ = 0-0021273885

  sion for each degree of the scale from 55° to 133f°.
      Fourthly: The same ingenious experimentalist found that for
  an accession of heat from 133^ to 212° the increase of bulk was
  from 1000 to      1 158 parts; we have therefore as 78'5     :  —    : : 1 :

          = 0-00201273885, the rate of expansion             reaching     from
   133| to 212: and by bringing these together for the purpose
  of more easy comparison, we find that
     From 65° to 133£, the rate of expansion is 0-002127389
             32 to 212                                     0-002083333

            133±to212                                      0-002012739
    The greatest rate of expansion in this statement is 0-002 1273 89,
  and the temperature corresponding is lower than either of the
  others, viz. from 55 to 133£.           The least rate is 0-002012739;
 and its corresponding temperature is from 133 \ to 212, which
 is the highest of all the four.        Of the other two, that from 32
  to 212 includes a lower part of the scale than the one reaching
 from 55 to 212; and we find the rate of expansion is propor-                    .
 tionally greater.        It therefore appears, that the rate of expan
 sion for the low temperatures is greater than that for the high
 ones ; and consequently m, the coefficient of 0, in that part of
 the foregoing theorem which depends on the heat of the atmo
 sphere, viz. lr— —r ought to be variable            according    to the dif-
 ferent heights of the mercury in the thermometer.
     Although the above table shows pretty clearly that the rate of
 expansion is greater in the low temperatures than in the high,
yet there is not a sufficient number of them, nor are they made at
the proper intervals to enable us to compute the exact law of this
rate, for all degrees, from the freezing to the boiling point, which
for the subject under consideration is very much to be desired.
    These are the determinations of the chemists.                Let us now

   A slight examination of the above values of n will convince
us that there is an evident change from 32° to 60°.     Now if in
the preceding formula we omit the part
or consider it as being constant   j  and take only the remaining
part of the expression, viz.

28             Further Remarks        on   Dr. Bradley's Theorem
                         or, t,(ZD-nr) x (1-wifl),
and substitute for n and for 0 their two extreme values taken            from
 the foregoing table of means, we shall have in one instance,
                     t,  [ZD-3-74r) x (1-ro x             32),
 and in the other,
                      t, (ZD—3-47r) x (I —in x 56), supposing the
 formula made for temperature zero.
     Now in these two equations, the lower the mercury is in the
thermometer, the greater is the value of n found to be: and
the higher it is on the contrary, the less is the value of n : but
to obtain the two values of n equal in the two equations, it is
 evident that the multiplier m must be increased at 32, and di
 minished at 56 ; which seems to be a further and interesting
 corroboration, of what was before stated, viz. that the rate of
 expansion for the low temperatures is greater than that for the
 high ones.
     By carrying this mode of reasoning a little further, and sup
posing in the two last equations, that the values of t, (ZD—nr)
are constant, it would in that case be evident, that the variations
 of m would be inversely as the numbers 32 and 56 ; or that
the rate of expansion would be in the inverse proportion of the
height of the thermometer, provided the refraction and the rest
 of the coefficients remained the same.              But as this is not the
case, and the result thus obtained is far greater than is proved
by experiments, and also that the ratio of the two values of m,
in the two equations, is considerably nearer a ratio of equality,
it follows that the value of n must also vary, and possibly, ac
cording to some function of ZD, or the zenith distance of the
object.
     The difficulty of determining the values of m, under all tem
peratures of the atmosphere, and of n at all altitudes, above the
horizon will, from this, become evident : and it shows that
they can only be obtained by some such method as that of the
least squares proposed by M. Lagrange*, and from a long series
of observations taken at all periods of the year, in order to find
them for the whole extent of the ranges of the barometer and
 thermometer.
     Were all other circumstances to remain the same, and only
the value of m to change, we might easily obtain it in the fol
lowing manner :
     The mean refraction r is to the apparent refraction g as 1 to
           r, or r i g : : I +  m  fl : 1 ; and therefore  r=  g (1  + mi ),
  1 -\- mi
                             T          1
consequently       m    = —             r- ;  and by taking the     different

    With respect to the value of p, Mr. Delambre found it to
be 60-499872" at 45 degrees of apparent altitude, when the
barometer stood at 29-92152 English inches, and Fahrenheit's
thermometer at 32°.        Mr. Groombridge found it 58- 132967''
at the same altitnde, when the barometer was 29 60 English
inches, and the thermometer at 45°.
    To compare these two values of p together, it is necessary to
reduce one of them to the tenor of the other.        Thus Mr. De-
lambre's determination, when brought to the same state of the
atmosphere as that of Mr. Groombridge, will be
        69-499872" x
                        ~(l+!/l52s^y                =58.33311".
 and    Mr.  Groombridge makes his 58-132967"; the difference
 0-200143" is small, and confirms the accuracy of the observations
 of both ; yet small as it appears, it will very materially affect the
 refractions from 87° downwards to the horizon.
     It is much to be doubted, whether this theorem or any other
 can be brought to agree with the utmost exactness in all cases
 with the refraction observed at very low altitudes, and for the
 following reasons :
     The ray P S in its progress through the atmosphere from the
  star S to the observer P, has probably to encounter layers of air
  of various temperatures and densities, which differ considerably
  from that indicated by the barometer and thermometer fixed
  up for use at P, the station of the observer : therefore, to be
  enabled to form any just conjecture of the deviations which the
  rav may have undergone, we ought to know the state of the at
  mosphere all the way from P to S ; or at least we ought to be
  acquainted with the heat and density indicated by these two in
  struments along the surface of the earth, from the station of
  the observer at P to Q, the point immediately beneath the ob
  ject observed.

30          Further Remarks on      Dr. Bradley's   Theorem
   It is well known that showers of rain often proceed in zones
along the surface of the earth, in various directions ; and should
this have taken place across any part of the arc P Q, a short
time previous to the observation being made, the evaporation
that follows, by producing a greater degree of cold, will cause
a considerable augmentation in the refractive power of the cir
cumambient air.
   A large surface of sand, situated any where along the arc P Q
will, by absorbing a considerable portion of heat from the sun's
rays, and afterwards continuing to restore it to the atmosphere,
longer than the neighbouring soils that have absorbed less, by
keeping up the rarefaction, bend the ray out of its course, in
an opposite direction to that of the former cause;
   A large wood or a marsh will also be the cause of deviation
in the trajectory of the ray: and all these actions on its course
will be the stronger the nearer it lies to the horizon, or in other
words the less the altitude of the object.
   Mr. Delambre, in the excellent Treatise of Astronomy which
he has lately published, makes the following remarks on the re
fraction at low altitudes.
   "   It follows from all this that Simpson's Formula and Brad
ley's Table will not agree with the observations.           There is an
error of about 8" at 82 p, and no known table will agree with
them. That of the Board of Longitude computed from Laplace's
formula, and on the value which I found for the constant quan
tity a, (the refraction at 45° which is p of our formula) agrees
better, but the error is still from 2" to 3".
   "  I have already spoken of the uncertainty of observations of
refraction in the neighbourhood of the horizon.              I have re
marked, from one day to the next, and in circumstances which
were the same in appearance, that the refraction would vary from
 15" to 20", without my being able to assign any cause; but the
variations are still more sensible in the horizon, as we may judge
from the following statement :

32         Further Remarks on Dr. Bradley's Theorem, &,c.
     " In   the observations   of zenith   distances of terrestrial ob
jects, I   have repeatedly noticed,     that at the setting of the sun
the refraction increased from 2 minutes to 2 \ minutes ; so
 that objects which were hid during the whole of the day, became
visible in the evening.      (See Base du Syst. Metr. Decimal, t. i.
 pag. 157, 159,     and  165).    I have never seen that the state of
the hygrometer had any sensible influence on the terrestrial re
fraction; (ibid, page 166).         Messrs. Laplace, Gay-Lussac and
 Biot have proved, that it does not produce any change in the
 astronomic refraction." — Delambre's Asir. torn. i. p. 318.
     It is therefore evident, that to complete the solution of this
 problem much yet remains to be done.            From the present view
 of the subject, it would appear as if the best mode would be, to
 take successive altitudes of objects with an accurate altitude
 and azimuth instrument, from the times of their rising in the
 eastern part of the horizon, till they set in the western part,
 giving the preference to those that pass the meridian nearest to
 the horizon below the pole: and to repeat the observations at
 various seasons of the year under a great variety of densities and
 temperatures of the atmosphere.         Each single observation should
 be recorded, and not the mean of a number, as is usual for other
 purposes in astronomy.         They should be taken in as quick suc
 cession near the horizon as accuracy will admit ; but higher up
 a smaller number will be sufficient.          The meridional altitude
 should also be taken with great care above the pole when the
 state of the weather is favourable, as that will materially assist in
  the calculation.
     By this means, the latitude of the place being known, together
 with the declination and azimuth of the object, or the time
 when the observation was made, we may, by computation, ob
 tain its true altitude ; and the difference between this and the
 observed altitude will be the refraction at that point.              In
 this manner, from       a number    of  observations, we   shall obtain
 the refraction at every degree of altitude, from the horizon to
 the zenith ; and taking them under different densities and tem
 peratures, we may by equations of condition, or the method
 of the least squares, develop the whole, and assign, with the ut
 most accuracy, to each unknown quantity in the formula, its
 due magnitude in all its variety of circumstances.
     The method is, it must be acknowledged, very laborious, and
 will require much time, both in making the observations and
 in computing them; but the advantages which astronomy will
 derive from an exact determination of this equation, are pro
 portionally great.     Did the duties of my situation afford suffi
  cient leisure, and the smoke of London permit the observations
  to be made, I should feel the utmost gratification in performing
  this labour, tedious as it appears to be.

   Thus I have endeavoured to show in what points this theorem
Js defective, not with any view to depreciate its value, but to assist
in rendering it more perfect. It is the most simple one we have:
and when the four unknown coefficients beforementioned, can be
ascertained for all altitudes, densities and temperatures, a great
obstacle to improvement will be removed, and the future pro
gress of astronomy much facilitated.

                                To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —   I   beg leave to obtrude mvself again on your notice, to
offer a few remarks on the metallic salts, in reply to the answer
of your correspondent H. (p. 24G, vol. xlvi,) to my paper (p. 44
same volume).    This I feel myself impelled to do, not only from
the importance of the subject, but from some statements which
H. has adduced as unobjectionable facts in support of the theory
contained in his former paper.         Before I proceed, however, it
will be necessary to define the import of the words free and
excess as hereafter used, philosophical        discussions requiring a
strict adherence to terms.       Indeed an omission of this kind has
produced some degree of displeasure in your correspondent, who
objects to my using the words free and excess indiscriminately,
which alone should be attributed to the different opinions we
entertain of the subject.      By acid in execs I mean, when the
superabundance of acid is chemically combined with the base,
and forms a constituent part of the salt.          By free acid, when
mechanically   united  or  only adhering    to the salt.
   The inquiry      is, an excess of acid
                          if                     really essential to the
                                                    is
existence of all metallic salts. The arguments on one side tend
to show that   it    essential, because their solutions constantly

alleges in opposition,    that  the  greater proportion    of   free acid,
rather than render a metallic salt more soluble, will in most in
stances precipitate       it,
                         and that the water alone was the solvent            ;

otherwise one substance would become alternately the solvent
and precipitant of the salt.
   From the tenor of our papers it cannot be misconceired that
water was intended as the medium of solution, particularly as I
stated the acid as the agent promoting the solubility, not as dis
solving the salt; and those least acquainted with chemistry are
fully satisfied that neither the salts, alkalies, nor even acids them
selves are soluble without such medium.
    H. evidently finds a difficulty in the attempt to reconcile
the incongruity of one body assisting alternately the solution and
precipitation of a salt.    With him I should find some hesitation
in admitting the fact, unless it could be accounted for on ra
tional principles : but we observe ammonia precipitating and
redissolving the metallic salts ; we observe likewise water sa
turated    with a salt beginning to crystallize, — the crystallization
proceeding   to  a certain point, and the water then redissolving
the crystals deposited.      It is needless here to enter into the
causes producing such effects, I merely wished to show that che
mistry was not without facts of this kind.          With respect to the
case under consideration, acid cannot be added to an unlimited
extent ; for upon the addition of too considerable a quantity the
salt may be deprived entirely of the water by superior affinity,
as Benthollet has clearly demonstrated.
   The slight degree of acid, either in excess or free, which          is-
apparent     bythe test, unless supported       byother very powerful
proofs cannot be depended on as decisive        :  the test proving no
more than that T-Jjnrdth orTBTST^th Part of tne solution was acid,
which minute portion might possibly adhere to the crystals.
   If sufficient quantity of acid existed the salts to require
     a                                           in
the preposition super, an effervescence on the affusion of water
and the addition of carbonated alkali, would be observed in
variably; but which     is  seldom the case with the neutral salts
carefully procured.      Besides, many crystallized salts, on the ad
dition of water, divide into super- and sub-salts; the former solu
ble, the latter insoluble or nearly so: and sometimes the at
traction of the water for the acid        sufficiently strong in a de
                                          is
gree  to overcome    the attraction of  the acid for the base  ;   either
of  which   might    be  given   as   areason   for  the  indication   of
acidity.
    The salts of lead are conspicuous as being generally insoluble,
owing probably to the great attraction between the acid and
base; and    it has not been denied them, on that account, to
class with  the neutrals, and they are soluble on the addition of
free acid.   Not only an increase of the acid forming the salt,,
but often the addition of     different acid, as the acetic acid to
                              a
                                                                     the

 the muriat of lead, the nitric acid to the sulphat of silver, &c.,
 promotes materially the solubility.
     In support of H.'s assertion, that metallic salts are super-salts
 with excess of oxide, he instances the formation of sulphat of
 iron ; and says, that after the action ceases, if sufficient iron had
be«n introduced, part of it remains uncombined, and the solu
 tion acid ; but this arises, I conceive, from the want of contact
between the free acid and iron, the crystals as they form sur
 rounding it ; and this, perhaps, is one reason why sulphat of iron
is seldom obtained unmixed with the super-sulphat.
    He states also that acid is indicated on the application of the
 test to a large crystal of sulphat of copper on breaking it. F
 never had the satisfaction of obtaining a large crystal of the
salt, and am inclined to suspect it more than probable he might
try the blue vitriol of commerce, which is well known to be a
 super-salt, the neutral sulphat being seldom, if ever, obtained;
or, if he really tried a large crystal of the neutral sulphat, it is
 not unlikely that a minute portion of acid might have been re
 tained in the interstices or between the laminae of the crystal.
    My opinion   is, that there can be no solution of a metallic salt
 without acid either free or in excess.    Fourcroy, as before ob^
served, noticed this, as well as Bergman and most other chemical
 writers
       ;    and as this superabundance always appeared on the
 solution of the salt, or was required to be added to enable the
salt to dissolve,it     natural to conclude that
                       is                              essential either
                                                             it   is

to adopt the latter opinion.

     IX.   On the dispersive Power        of the Atmosphere; and its Effect
        on astronomical      Observations.      By Stephen Lee, Clerk and
        Librarian   to the Rvyal Society.          Communicated by W. H.
        Wollasi-on, M.D. Sec.R.S.*
    Notwith standing             the pains which astronomers have taken
    to determine accurately the refraction of mixed light, nothing-,
    I believe, has ever been done towards ascertaining the dispersive
    power of common air, or comparative degree of refrangibility
    of the differently coloured rays in their passage through our at-
  *mosphere.
        The importance of such an inquiry, however, must be obvious
    to every one who duly considers the effect which the different
    degree's of refrangibility of the variously coloured lights must
    necessarily produce in the apparent situations of differently-co
    loured objects.      Stars of different colours must be differently re
    fracted, and the apparent altitude of the sun must vary accord
   ing to the colour of the dark glass through which he is viewed.
       Perhaps this cause alone is sufficient to explain the disagree
   ment which is found to exist between the latitude of a place de
    duced from observations of circumpolar stars, and that deduced
   from observations of the sun during the solstices, which has so
   long occupied the attention of astronomers, and has never yet
   been satisfactorily accounted forf.
       The dispersive power of the atmosphere will also show why
   Aldebaran and the red stars are sometimes seen projected on
   the moon's disk in occupations by that planet, especially when
 "the immersion or emersion happens to be near her upper limb.
   For the light of the moon being white, is more refracted than
   that of the star, and consequently her limb more elevated, which
   would occasion the star to appear within her disk a few seconds
   before or after contact      J.
       The great disagreement which is found to exist in the decli-
\ nation of several of the fixed stars, as given by different ob
   servers, may probably be traced to the same cause, stars being
   more or less refracted according to the predominant colour of
   which their light is composed.
       That the fixed stars differ from each other in respect to the
   composition of their light, must be obvious to any one who will

only take the trouble of comparing them on a fine night. They
 present a striking variety of colour even to the naked eye.           But
 this difference becomes still more perceptible when they are
 viewed through a prism properly adapted to the eye-piece of a
reflecting telescope.
     A star viewed in this manner is converted into a prismatic
spectrum.        Sirius and the brilliant white stars exhibit a large
brush of beautiful violet, and the most refrangible colours in
great abundance.         Aldebaran, a Orionis, and the red stars show
only a small proportion of those colours, whilst the dull white
stars exhibit a great quantity of intense green light.
     The planets also differ much from each other in this respects
 The moon, Venus, and Jupiter, seem to possess every colour ;
but the green is very pale in all of them.             Mercury and Mars
appear deficient in the middle and most refrangible rays, whilst
the light of Saturn seems to be composed principally of the
mean rays with a very small proportion of the extreme colours
 of the prism *.
     The different refrangibility of the differently coloured rays is
 very visible in stars near the horizon.        If viewed on a fine night
 with a power of 200 and upwards, they appear expanded into a
 prismatic spectrum.         Sirius, when within a few degrees of the
 horizon, presents a most beautiful object.
     Having remarked the very oblong figure which the spectrum
assumes when near the horizon, and found from repeated obser-.
vations of different stars that the separation of light begins to be
visible as high as 40' or 50D of altitude, I was led to believe that:
the dispersive power of the atmosphere must be sufficient, in
many eases, to produce considerable effect on astronomical ob
servations; and, consequently, to suppose that it would be de-.
 sirable to ascertain, if possible, the exact degree of separation
 of the several raysf.                             *
    With this view, therefore, I began a series of observations ;
the result of which, and the manner of conducting them, I shall
now take the liberty of laying before the Society.
    • Query.     May not this circumstance explain why Saturn, though less    *
 brilliant, hears magnifying better than Jupiter and Venus !
    f  Dr. Herschel, in a note to his paper on Doable Stars, published in
 the seventy-fifth volume of the Philosophical Transactions, says that the
prismatic power of the atmosphere is very visible in low stars; and very
justly observes that this power ought not to be overlooked in delicate and
low observations : he gives the measure of two diameters of s Sagittarii,
 which seem to indicate that the refraction of the extreme rays is about
      4-, the mean refraction.   I think it due to that grent astronomer to
 mention the circumstance, though it was totally unknown to me till long
 after  I had completed my observations on Mars.

   The first instrument employed for the purpose with any de
gree of satisfaction, was the two-feet reflector made by Mr.
Short, and which belongs to the Royal Society.                  In the com
pound    focus  of  the  eye-piece    of this telescope,   I fixed-  horizon
tally  a  narrow   slip  of  ivory.     With   the   instrument     thus  pre
pared, I observed Capella, and other low stars near the meri
dian. By carefully noticing the intervals of time between the
first contact and total immersion, and between the first appear
ance and complete emersion of the star from behind the slip of
ivory, I obtained data from which it was easy to calculate its
vertical breadth, which, compared by estimation with its hori
zontal breadth, gave the separation of the extreme rays of light.
    It was impossible, however, to remain long satisfied with
such coarse' measures, and not finding it convenient to go to
much expense on this account, I applied to my friend Mr.
Rermie for the loan of his seven-feet reflector made by Dr.
Herschel, to which I adapted a very excellent wire micrometer
made by Mr. Troughton ; and thus, by the kind assistance of
my friends, I obtained instruments capable of measuring small
angles to the fraction of a second of space.
    With this apparatus I repeatedly measured the diameter of
Mars during his opposition in 1813.             The Society's apartments
being well situated for the purpose, 1 observed the planet as
soon as he became visible over the buildings, until he attained
his meridian altitude, whicb never exceeded 15°.
    With a power of 170 and upwards, the disk of the planet ap
peared much elongated, especiallywhen near the horizon ; the
upper limb was of a fine blue, the lower limb of a deep red.
    By carefully measuring the diameter of Mars and the breadth
of the coloured edges, I endeavoured to ascertain, as exactly as
possible, the degree of separation of the differently coloured
images of the planet.
    But after all it was no easy matter to measure the coloured
edges exactly, for the light which was necessary to illuminate
the wires, rendered the colours so very faint as to make it ex
tremely difficult to distinguish their precise boundaries.                 For
 this reason, and because I wished to apply higher powers than
could be used with the micrometer,             I    adopted the following
method,     which   I found    far  more   convenient, and    is,I    believe,
 quite  as accurate.
 I    drew on a sheet of paper several figures of two equal circles
 cutting each other, placing the centres of the circles in the first
figure (Plate I.) TVth of their radius from each other; in the se
cond figure ^ths; in the third T3„ths         ;    and so on. The upper
crescent of these figures   I      painted blue, the lower crescent red,

           On the dispersive Tower   of the Atmosphere,   tsfc.   39
and the part common to both circles of a reddish yellow, soften
 ing the colours into each other as they appeared in the planet.
For I considered that, in fact, it was not a single image of Mars
that was seen, but a number of differently coloured images,
lying in the same direction, though lifted one above another, as
represented in the annexed figures.
   Having prepared a number of these drawings, I repeatedly
compared them with the planet viewed through the telescope
with different magnifying powers, carefully noting which figure
he most resembled, and the time of observation.
   This being done, it was easy to calculate the exact altitude
from the time of observation, and to make a very near estimate
of the separation of the images from the figure referred to, com
pared with the diameter of the planet found by the micrometer.
   From a great number of observations on Mars, Venus, and
the fixed stars, taken in all these different ways, I found the de
viation of the extreme rays of light to be between '5-Vth an^ rn^1
part of the total refraction.
   It has already been observed, that the disagreement which is
found to exist between the latitude of a place deduced from ob
servations of circumpolar stars, and that from observations of
the sun, may perhaps be traced to the use of dark glasses. But
this will appear more evidently from a reference to the method
employed by Dr. Bradley for determining the quantity of re
fraction, which method is very clearly described by Dr. Maske-
lyne in the seventy-seventh volume of the Philosophical Trans
actions.    He says,
   That Dr. Bradlty got the height of the pole from observations
of the circumpolar stars, and the height of the equator from
observations of the sun "at the two equinoxes; that he found
these two altitudes together amounted to 89°, 58', 3", which
being subtracted from 90°, leaves V, 57", for the sum of the
refractions at the pole and equator ; and that of this quantity
he assigned 45|" to the former, and 7 It" to the latter.
   But Dr. Bradley undoubtedly made use of dark glasses for
observing the sun, probablv smoked glasses, which would give
                               C 4                              him

him a pale orange-coloured image, or one of less than mean re-
frangibility ; consequently, the quantity of refraction as found
by Dr. Bradley must be too small for white light.
   This alone is sufficient to produce a small difference between
the results of our observations of the sun and of the stars.     I
shall now   mention two other circumstances which appear to    me
to have produced a still greater apparent disagreement.
   The publication of the Nautical Almanack in 1767, led to the
general use of Hadley's sextant.      In the construction of this
instrument, coloured glasses were indispensibly necessary; and
the great convenience in the use of them over smoked glasses,
soon occasioned the application of them to all other instruments.
These glasses generally give a deep-red image, or one of less re-
frangibility than stroked glass. The effect of this alteration,
therefore, should have been, that arising from too great correc
tion for refraction in every thing depending on observations of
the sun.
    The introduction of achromatic object-glasses* produced an
error of a different kind ; and one which, in certain cases, tends
to correct the other.     In the single object-glass telescope (and
there were no others in Bradley's time) the differently coloured
images are formed at different focal distances, which, in a man
ner, compels the observer to adjust his instrument to the most
intense light; that is to say, to the orange-coloured          f
                                                          image; by
this means the fainter colours, which occupy the greatest space
in the spectrum J, are dissipated, and lost among the more power
ful rays. In good achromatic telescopes the case is very dif
ferent, for all the rays being collected by them into one point,
every colour is seen in its proper place ; so that the observer, in
bisecting the spectrum, takes the altitude of the mean, or the
upper extremity of the green image.
    But if the upper extremity of the green image be taken in
 observations of circumpolar stars, a greater correction than Dr.
Bradley's ought to be applied, in order to get the true height of
the pole.
    It may not be amiss to observe here, that the observations of
 Mr. Lalnnde at Paris, show a greater disagreement than those
 at Greenwich ; and the observations of Mr. Piazzi at Palermo,
 a still greater than those of Mr. Lalande.      This, I apprehend,
 must arise partly from the lesser elevation of the pole in those
 places, and partly from the fainter colours in the stellar spectra

being more distinctly visible      in the clear atmospheres of France
and Italy than in England.
    It should seem then, that in order to get a perfect knowledge
of astronomical refraction, we ought to employ at least three
different methods of investigation.         1st. By observations of the
fixed stars during the night, when all the prismatic colours are
visible.     2dly. By observations of the stars during the day,
when none but the orange-coloured            rays are to be seen. And
3dly. By observations of the sun with different coloured glasses.
By these means we might hope to obtain such an accurate know
ledge of atmospheric refraction as would enable us to form tables
adapted to every possible circumstance.
    But I must not take up the time of the Society by any addi
tional observations.       It is in vain for me to pursue the subject
any further, in a situation so ill-adapted to astronomical obser
vations as Somerset Place : I shall therefore resign the task to
those who are more favourably placed in this respect, and who
possess instruments better calculated for an investigation which
 requires so much accuracy.
 X.   A  Geological Sketch      of  a Part of Cumberland and West
                 moreland.      By A Correspondent.
 The     geology of Great Britain has of late years become an ob
 ject  of considerable attention, and much has been done in ac
 quiring a knowledge of the different rocks, their relative position,
 and the extent they occupy on the surface, — more especially in
 the south of England, where the different formations appear to
 have been described with as much accuracy as the present state
  of our knowledge of the subject will admit.            In the northern
  counties, however, little has been done except so far as regards
  the Newcastle-coal-formation,       and the metalliferous rocks of the
  Cross Fell range of mountains ; and although the counties of
  Cumberland and Westmoreland have been frequently visited by
  very eminent mineralogists, and some attempts have been made
  in describing their geology ; yet from the multiplicity of forma
 tions they contain, these formations occurring in such detached
 and insulated patches, and the very great difficulty in investi
 gating and ascertaining their relative positions, we must consi
 der our knowledge of the physical structure of these counties as
 still very imperfect.     As this knowledge can only be acquired by
  the united efforts of a number of individuals,       I take the liberty
  of offering to this Society*, the following notices of some rocks
            * The Literary and Philosophical Society, Newcastle.
                                                                   which

42                 A  Geological Sketch    of Part of
which    seem hitherto-to have escaped the attention of mineralo
gists.    The Cross Fell range of mountains is composed of lime
stone, sandstone, slate-clay, coal and greenstone ; the dip of the
strata is towards the south-east, the mountains are very preci
pitous towards the west, and generally rest upon the old red
sandstone; but that this is not always the case, the following
facts will prove.    At the foot of the Cross Fell range towards
the west, a series of small conical hills make their appearance,
which I have traced from beside Helton near Brough in West
moreland} to the boundary of the county of Cumberland, a di
stance of about twelve miles; but the base of these hills is no
where more than three quarters of a mile in breadth.        From the
observations of Professor Buckland, of which a short notice was
published in Thomson's Annals, it appears that these hills, or at
least the rocks which compose them, extend considerably further
north, at least as far as Melmerby in Cumberland ; but this was
unknown to me at the time I examined this neighbourhood.
These hills or pikes, as they are called in the county, are com
posed of greenstone, grau-wacke and grau-wacke slate; and on
the north side of Dufton pike, which is the central one, granite
is found.
    These primitive and transition rocks do not form a continued
line, but are interrupted by the red sandstone which nearly sur
rounds the hills or pikes, till it almost comes in contact with the
limestone rocks : but although I have seen these rocks on the
surface at the distance of not more than 60 yards from each
ether, I have never been able to find their junction, nor to sa
tisfy myself as to their relative positions.    At Dufton there is a
very   good  section of the junction  of the metalliferous rocks with
the grau-wacke.      The limestone, &c. in approaching the older
rocks, vary from their nearly horizontal position, and rise towards,
the west at an angle of about 45° against the side of Dufton
pike ; and on the other side of the pike we find the red sand
stone dipping towards the west.           On Dufton pike both the
granite   and  grau-wacke    have  been  quarried for the purpose of
repairing the roads.
   At Warcop the grau-wacke is covered by a very singular
limestone, some strata of which are so full of fragments of
quartz, that at first sight I took it for an alternation of grau-
wacke with limestone.       The other strata are, however, compact,
resembling    basalt with  small spangles of mica interspersed, and
there is one of oolite ; the dip of this limestqne is to the west,
at an angle of 10° or 12°, and its outgoings are covered by the
metalliferous rocks, which, as is always the case in. this neigh
bourhood upon their coming near the older rocks, have their in
                                                             clination

                   Cumberland and Westmoreland.                     43
clination increased ; but the increase here is very great, making
an angle of not less than 70° with the horizon.         This limestone
is not more than half a mile in breadth, when the red sandstone
is found in nearly a conformable position, and appears to rest
upon the limestone; but of this I am not certain, as I could not
see these rocks in contact.       I am inclined to consider this lime
stone as belonging to the transition class, although I am aware
that it will be objected to, on account of its having beds of oolite,
which is always considered as belonging to the newest fketz.
I am afraid we fetter ourselves too much by considering certain
fossils as belonging exclusively to certain classes of rocks, by
which means many encrusting fossils are overlooked.          Mr. Bigg
found asbestus iu greenstone at Melmerby Scar, and I have lately
found the same substance forming veins in transition greenstone
in the neighbourhood of Keswick: — now this mineral is always
described as belonging only to serpentine rocks.         I found car
bonate of strontian in the basalt of the Giant's Causeway, and
this substance is said only to belong to primitive mountains.
    It is now about twelve years ago since I first observed granite
on Skiddaw and Saddleback, since when it has been frequently
visited ; but its relation with the other rocks composing these
mountains not having been ascertained, 1 was induced to ex
 amine them this summer.          The granite is found in the bed of
the rivulet which separates these mountains, and extends north
ward across the river Calduo to Carrick Fell ; it is rather small-
grained, composed of white felspar, quartz, and grayish mica.
The summits of Skiddaw and Saddleback are clay-slate and
hornblende-slate^n      alternate beds, dipping to the south at an
angle    of about 60°, and   resting immediately on the granite; but
on Carrick Fell this rock is covered by gneiss, the felspar of
which is of a grayish-white colour ; the mica abundant, but in
minute scales ; so that this rock might be mistaken for a thin
slaty micaceous sandstone, were it not sufficiently characterized
 by the felspar. The gneiss is again covered by mica-slate, which
becoming mixed with hornblende, passes into hornblende-slate,
thus proving the hornblende-slate,        and consequently the clay-
slate, to be of the same formation as the mica-slate.           On the
other part of Carrick Fell, the mica-slate is covered by sienite,
which forms nearly the whole of the mountains of Carrick and
Caldbeck Fells.      This sienite varies very much in its appearance :
the first rock  of it we meet with is very small grained, consisting
of reddish felspar-quartz, and very little green hornblende; after
that a beautiful large-grained variety is found; the felspar white
with black hornblende, the crystals of which are frequently
nearly an inch in length.       As we proceed northward the horn
                                                                blende

44        A   Geological Sketch of a       Part ofCumberland, &c.
 blende increases in quantity, and the sienite passes by almost
 imperceptible gradations into a compact greenish-black green
stone ; and on the summit of High-pike this greenstone forms
 the basis of an elegant porphyry with crystals of green felspar
 resembling the antique porphyry.             Near High-pike a strong
 east and west vein is wrought for lead ; but, from the hardness
of the rock and the difficulty of separating the numerous ores,                   I
 am afraid not to much advantage.           The vein stones in this mine
 are quartz and sulphate of barytes, often so internately mixed
 as to form a very singular stone.           The ores are sulphuret of
 lead, carbonate of lead, and phosphate of lead *, blende, copper-
 pyrites, grey copper ore, green and blue copper ore, and ma
 lachite.   The galena is antimonial, and is very rich in silver,
yielding   in  the refining furnace about 60 ounces in the ton.            I
 traced this vein westward for about three miles to a place called
 Silver Gill, where there is a very fine section of it on the sur
 face ; it is about three fathoms wide and hades to the north at
an angle of about 65°.           There is a tradition in the county, that
at this place a rich silver mine was wrought in the time of
queen Elizabeth, and certain it is that there are remains of very
extensive workings.          An attempt lias been made last spring to
recover   this  mine,  for  which   purpose a trench has been cut across'
the direction of the vein so as to bore the rock ; and although
this trench is not more than 200 yards from the old works, the
vein has not been found.          The cause of failure      is,
                                                           that the sienite
is  here covered      by  grau-wacke slate, into which the vein does
not penetrate: this        isdifferent from what has been observed in
 Cornwall,    where   the   veins  traverse both the granite and grau-
wacke slate    ;  andI   consider  it  as an interesting fact, since     so  it
decidedly marks the difference between these rocks.              The clay-
slate and hornblende slate on the summits of Skiddaw and Sad
dleback, with the granite gneiss and mica-slate, and the sienite
                                                                                      "
of Carrick and Catdbeck Fells, must therefore belong to the prl--
mitive class of rocks       ;  whilst the grau-wacke and grau-wacke-
slate which entirely surrounds these mountains are transition
rocks.    Some other veins have been wrought for copper in the~
sienite, but not to any great extent; nor do they appear to be of
much value.        Near Hatfield Hall      is
                                           a   vein containing the oxides
of titanium and iron (the titan-eisan of the Germans) — By the       ;

   Mr. Sheffield discovered molybdina in the   same neighbourhood ;

      The coal-formation of Whitehaven is covered at St. Bees
  Head by a curious bituminous clay, formed, as it were, of a
  number of hollow cones inserted into each other, till a column is
  formed whose length' (about a foot) is equal to the thickness of
  the stratum, and by the lateral aggregation of these columns the
  whole bed is formed : over this is a limestone containing mag
  nesia and iron, and exactly resembling some of the dark-co
  loured more compact beds at Whitby.          Above this is a red
  sandstone, connected with which is clay, marl, and gypsum. Thus
  a beautiful uniformity exists on the two sides of the island ; for
 if we suppose the limestone, &c. of the neighbourhood of Cocker-
  mouth to accord with the metalliferous rocks of Alston Moor,
  the Whitehaven coal- formation with that of Newcastle, the
  magnesian limestone of St. Bees with the Sunderland limestone,
  and the red sandstone with that of the Tees, —we have the series
 complete.     Notwithstanding the opinion of Professor Kidd, that
 our rocks are in a state of absolute confusion, I think I could
 show that our rocks, though numerous and occurring in small
 compass, are remarkably regular in their relations : but it would
 be leading me too far from the object of this paper, which is
 merely intended as a notice of some rocks which have lately
 fallen under my observation.
     XI.  Specimen of a new Nomenclature for Meteorological
                Science.    By Thomas Forster, Esq.
                             To Mr. Tilhch.
 Sir, — The        propensity which the English writers have to bor
 row from other languages terms used technically in the sciences,
 renders their works so very difficult to be understood by those
who do not understand the languages from which the words are
tierived.    Besides which; their habit of borrowing words has a
tendency to obliterate the distinctive characters of different
tongues, and has already made the English a motley and unphi-
losophical group of exotic words, which one might well suppose
had sprung from the confusion of Babel.         It is my intention to
 construct a scientific nomenclature (entirely out of our own lan
 guage, or its mother-tongue       the Saxon), and to adopt it in
my journals     of  meteorology.    I subjoin at present only a few
technical names, which I shall henceforward use, and which I
have already made, partly from the consideration above alluded
to, and partly from having been repeatedly desired by artists

  46 Specimen     of a new Nomenclature for MeleorologicalScience.
  and others who have made use of Mr. Howard's paper on the
  Clouds, and of my last Essay on Atmospheric Pheenomena, in
  order to depict more accurately clouds, &c. and to make an
  English nomenclature, as many persons unaccustomed to Latin
  could not retain the distinctions of the Latin nomenclatures in
  their memories.      The Latin terms for clouds, originally made by
  L. Howard, are very useful in descriptions in Latin, and in
  those which are to go abroad, or which are for scientific persons
  only; and should, I think, be inserted with the others. But we
  ought to use terms of science constructed out of the language in
  which that science is treated of. — I subjoin the following names
  for clouds, substituted for the former ones, and others substi
  tuted for those which I constructed from the Latin for kalos
  and other phaenomena made by refraction; and shall proceed in
  future to a more extended nomenclature for other terms of me
  teorological science.
     Cirrus, or Curlcloud. I propose to call this the curlcloud,
  from its constant tendency to assume the fibrous and flexible
 forms.     It is bent and curled in all directions ; and curlcloud
  comes nearest to its old name cirrus, of which cirrulus and curl
  are diminutives.
     Cirrocumtjlus, or Sonderci.oud, i. e. cloud consisting of
  an aggregate of clouds asunder (from A. S. sond, Old Eng. «-
 sonder and sonder) : the distinguishing marks of this cloud
 being that of separate orbs aggregated together, and the change
 to this cloud from others is a separation of continuity into par-
 ticules.
     Cirrostratus, or Waneclotjd. The constantly evanescent
 state of this cloud in all its forms suggests this name.     It is al
 ways subsiding or altering its form, or waning, a verb now not
 so much used as formerly, and which comes from the Anglo-
 Saxon Fynigean, evanescere ; whence also our words to faint,
feint, &c.
     Cumulus, or Stackenci.oud, i.e. stackt cloud, from being
 piled or heaped up ; to stack being a known verb for piling up.
 The participial termination en gives the word a pleasanter sound
 then stackcloud.
     Stratus, or Fallcloud, being the subsidence or falling of
 the aqueous particles in the evening, I first thought of even-
 cloud, corresponding to the German ahendwolke ; but that is
 not definite enough, as many clouds become evening clouds.
     Cumulostratus, or Twaincloud ; being the visible result
 often of the coalescence of two modifications (supposed with
 opposite electricities) and when it forms primarily a similar union
 being conjectured of particules separately electrified as soon as
 formed.

    Coronas will be called Mooncrowns, &c. But I give this
merely as an imperfect specimen of the nomenclature I am
making;, and which I shall publish and give in your Magazine in
a short time : meanwhile I shall adopt these words of Saxon de
rivation in my journal,       and give an explanation   in the notes to

XII.   On the Influence    of the Atmosphere  on the Electro- Galvanic
            Column    of M. De Luc.       By Mr.   i. Tatum.
                              To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — Although            various accounts of Mr. De Luc's electrical
column have appeared in your Magazine, I do not recollect that
any journal of its action as connected with atmospherical           in
fluence has yet appeared.          Having long observed the very con
siderable alteration which every thermometrical change in the
atmosphere produced on the operation of this instrument, I
determined on keeping a regular journal, and noticing its cor
responding change with those indicated by the barometer, ther
mometer, De Luc's hygrometer, and the direction of the wind.
The results of my observations as deduced from my daily register
of those instruments have convinced me that the greatest changes
in the oscillations of the ball on De Luc's columns are chieflv,
if not entirely owing/ to the increased temperature of the at
mosphere, and not to its moisture, as some of my philosophical
friends had supposed.         By the following extract of my journal,
it appears that when the thermometer was 52° and hygrometer
 81°, the ball of the columns oscillated only 248 times in a mi
nute; but when the thermometer was                and the hygrometer
 503, it oscillated 284 times; a satisfactory proof that the heat
 and not the moisture of the atmosphere increased the action of the
instrument.       In the latter case, I had removed the instrument
 to the gallery of my lecture-room, where the thermometer was
 14° higher, ar.d the hygrometer 5° drier than at the place from
 whence it was removed.
    It is proper also to add, that from the 1st till the 13th of the
 month the thermometer and hygrometer were not in the same
 apartment with the electrical columns, a circumstance which
 may have occasioned some difference in the results.         Since that
                                   i                             period

48    On the Influence        of the Atmosphere      on the Electric Column,
period the whole apparatus                 has been inclosed together in 3
glass case, where all experience the same atmospheric influence.
    As my columns are constructed similar to those already de
scribed in your Magazine, it will be unnecessary to describe them
any further than to say that the diameter of the balls is 2*65
inches, their distance from each other 0*58, and the diameter of
the gold ball 0-4 inches.            I have constructed several other co
lumns of different diameters ; and from a comparison of one
which is only 0-53 of an inch in diameter with one which is
0"76 of an inch (and by which this register is kept), I am in
clined to believe that the power of the instrument is very little
increased by the diameter of the plates, but that it regularly in
creases with their number.               But, as I am engaged in making-
other columns of different construction                 and diameter, i shatl
soon be enabled to speak more decisively on this head.

 XIII. Description of a Gas Lamp for Coal-Mines,              invented

                 many shocking accounts of accidents in coal-mines
from the explosion of gas, induced me (no doubt with many
others) to consider some means of preventing such dreadful ac
cidents.   The contrivance of a lantern that might be kept as it
were insulated from the atmosphere of the mine, appeared the
most likely mode of preventing explosion ; and I thought mine,
of which I have subjoined a sketch, would fully answer the pur
pose.    When I was about sending this to the Editor of The Phi
losophical Magazine, your experiments and very learned obser-
vations-on the subject, and very ingenious contrivance of a safety-
lantern, appeared in that work ; the excellence of which in sim
plicity and portability rendered it unnecessary, I thought, for
me to say any thing respecting mine.         However, on reconsider
ing  the matter,  I am   induced  to  think that the coal-mines may
be lighted with mueh advantage, in point of expense, with gas,
aa the material   for its production rises on the spot.       My first
plan was intended for burning oil, and the addition of the pipe
for conducting gas is the only alteration made.
   The pipes a and   I are main pipes, the one to conduct gas from
the gasometer, the other to bring a supply of air to maintain

the combustion: the air-pipe to be kept full by the degree of
pressure that may be found requisite from bellows kept in rela
 tion by the steam-engine ; the size of the bellows to be pro
portioned to the number of lights that are to be fed.      The lan
tern should be made perfectly air-tight, the crown of which
should terminate, as represented in the sketch, by a tube im
 mersed in water contained in the basin c.       The air vitiated by
 combustion would run into the tube and be forced through the
 water by the pressure of air from the bellows.       On one side of
 the lantern bangs an air-tight glove fastened round a hole suf
 ficiently large to admit a man's hand ; and on the same side Is
 a case of matches and a bottle which may be ignited without
 air escaping from the lantern, or finding its way into the lantern
 from the mine.      The aperture for the hand may be further se
 cured by a door on the outside,      d is an enlarged sketch of the
 gas-burner and air-pipe which may be united with the lantern
 by the screw e.
     Should this contrivance be founded on erroneous principles,
 which a very limited knowledge of science makes me doubtful
  of, I hope that I shall be forgiven this intrusion, and that an
 attempt to be useful will, with Sir Humphry Davy, be sufficient
  apology for any liberty of this nature.

 a mean for relighting the lamp when extinguished, without any
 danger of an explosion. — Note by Sir H. Davy.

     " It  is impossible to converse    with persons in the neighbour
hood of the collieries where explosions have happened from the
 fire -damp, and not to be strongly affected by the accounts they
 give of the destruction of human life and the variety of human
 misery produced by these dreadful accidents.            By a single ex
plosion     in the  Felling colliery*  94  persons   were   destroyed, and
nearly     as  many    families  plunged   into  deep   distress j and the
frequency of the occurrence of these catastrophes, notwith
 standing the improvements in the ventilation of the mines, and
the continued activity of the persons concerned in the care of
the works, had almost produced a feeling of despair in the
minds of many benevolent persons, as to the possibility of finding
a remedy sufficiently simple and oeconomical to be used in the
mines ; and when I first turned my attention to the inquiry, it
was rather with a faint hope than a strong expectation of dis
covering in the resources of chemistry means of securing the
miner from the effects of the fire-damp.
     " On considering the subject before I was acquainted with the
nature of the gas, the simple method of burning a lamp in a pneu
matic apparatus supplied with air through water occurred to me, as
it probably has to every one versed in chemistry; but I found, on
inquirv, that this idea had been long ago put into execution by
Dr. Clannv, and published, whilst I was absent from England,
in the Philosophical Transactions. Dr. Clanny showed me his
lamp at Bishop Wearmouth, after I had made some inquiries as
to the state of the mines.         It appeared to me ingeniously ex
ecuted ; but when I proposed the trial of it to some enlightened
and liberal inspectors of mines, they stated that its size, weight,

Rev. John Hodgson.       I have named this gentleman amongst many others
who obligingly gave me assistance in my inquiries, and     I cannot mention
bim again without again making my acknowledgements for the variety of
Information he afforded me during the visits that we made together to the
collieries, and for the general interest he has taken in my experiments on
 the subject.

unexpected principles of security,        gave up all experiments upon
                                          I
the piston-lamp, as well as upon another contrivance of an en
tirely different kind described in the Appendix.
    " The principles of security furnished to me           by
                                                            a philosophical
inquiry  into  the   properties   of the  gas  are  all  derived    from the
 general fact,  that  the fire-damp requires     amuch    higher tempera
 ture for its combustion than other inflammable gases.                 Hence
small additions of azote or carbonic acid destroy the explosive
powers of mixtures of fire-damp and air            ; hence explosions of
 mixtures will not take place when their quantities are small
 compared to the cooling surfaces to which they are exposed                     ;
and hence one part of an explosive atmosphere of fire-damp
 may be burnt in free communication             with another         bycertain
 cooling apertures or surfaces without any danger of explosion.

consideration of the principle has led me to a discovery which
 appears the most important in the whole progress of these re
searches.

                                                                    constant

 constant flame from explosive mixtures issuing from tubes or
 canals ; but on trying this, even in atmospherical air, it failed.
     " Conceiving that the failure was owing to the great cooling
 powers of the metallic sides of the canal, it occurred to me to
try the metallic wire-flame sieves, and with these I had perfect
 success.
     " I inclosed a verv small lamp in a cylinder made of wire-
gauze having 6400 apertures in the square inch.             I closed all
apertures except those       of the gauze, and introduced the lamp
burning brightly within the cylinder into a large jar containing
several quarts of the most explosive mixture of gas from the di
stillation of coal and air; the flame of the wick immediately dis
appeared, or rather was lost, for the whole of the interior of the
cylinder became filled with a feeble but steady flame, of a green
colour, which burnt for some minutes, till it had -entirely de
stroyed the explosive power of the atmosphere.
     " This result, so satisfactory, immediately led to a number of
experiments which gave results, if possible, still more satisfac-        *
 tory.
     " I introduced the lamp inclosed in the cylinder, at different
times, into large quantities of various explosive mixtures, some
containing only one volume of coal-gas to four of air, and others
containing one of coal gas to 13 of air.        In all cases the flame
was confined to the cylinder, and in all of them it continued till
the mixture ceased to be explosive.
     " In mixtures of 13, 12, and 1 1 parts of air to one of coal-
gas, the flame of the taper did not disappear ; it became paler,
however, and blended with the flame of the explosive mixture
fiiling the cylinder.    As the quantity of the inflammable air di
minished, the flame became limited to the wick, and was gra
dually extinguished.      When there was as much as one of coal-
gas to 7 or -8 of air, the flame of the taper was lost at first in
the flame of the explosive mixture, whkh was very bright ; but
it appeared as the mixture became less explosive.
     " When the coal-gas was 1 to 4 or 5, theilame of the wick
never appeared in any part of the experiment; and the light of the
flame from the mixture was weaker than in the other experiments.
    " In taking the wire-cylinder and its lamp out of the explo
sive mixture, the flame of the lamp continued to burn in the at
mosphere.                                                              ;
    "  In all the experiments the flame of the explosive mixture
in the cylinder had more or less of a greenish east, which is pro
bably to be attributed to the effect of the brass wire.
     " In one instance, in which a very large wick was burnt in a
very small cylinder, the wire-gauze became red hot opposite to
the wick at the first moment of the introduction of the cyclinder
                                 D 3                               into

into an atmosphere consisting of about 1 of coal-gas and 1 1 of
 air ; but it soon lost this temperature : and in other experiment*
made with smaller wicks in a dark room, I have seldom seen the
wire "dull red: but as no explosion ever took place in an atmo
sphere made explosive by coal-gas, the circumstance, for reasons
that will be fully stated in the communication made to the Royal
Society*, will hold good with much more certainty of the fire
damp.
   ** I
        own I expected an explosion in the instance when I saw
the wire-gauze red hot ; but the mass of heated matter was pro
bably too small to heat considerably the portion of gas in con
tact with        and the cool air must have entered principally at
                      it,
this part of the wire-gauze cylinder, and must speedily have re
duced the temperature          and     have since found that

wire of less than the -j^th of an inch does not explode mixtures
of coal-gas and air.

mixture before          had consumed much of the inflammable gas,

     "I have   tried cylinders of the size necessary for the colliers,
in    explosive atmospheres contained in large glass vessels ; the
light given by a cylinder of seven inches high and two inches in
diameter in the fire-damp mixed with 12 of air, is nearly as
bright as that -of the lamp in common air, and even the least
brilliant flame would enable the miner to find his way, and, 1
think, would be sufficient for him to work by when he was very
near it.     The light is much increased by hanging within, from
the top of the cylinder, a small cage of platina or iron wire ; this
becomes ignited by the flame, and gives a steady red light in the
midst of it ; and 1 have never had an explosion in employing it.
   " The cheapness of the wire-gauze safe-lamps or guards for
candles, will be an additional reason for bringing them into com
mon use ; for the dearest of them can hardly cost more than
one shilling.
   " They have the advantage of guarding the light from loose
materials falling from the roof of the mine ; there is no danger
of their being broken ; and to prevent them from being bent,
they may be covered with a frame without, constructed of a few
pieces of thick wire.      The gauze should be made into the form
of cylinders by double joinings sewn together through the double
part by a wire of small diameter ; any aperture larger than that
of the gauze-wire should be most carefully guarded against, and
the cylinders should be tried in a vessel filled with an explosive
mixture before they are used in the mine.         A coating of oxide
is soon formed upon trie brass J but in my limited experience
this has appeared to defend the interior from the action of air,
and to render the wire durable :      if,however,     should be found
                                                     it
that this does not hold good in "the mines, thicker or plated
wire may be adopted, or double cylinders, or, at all events, as the
top of the cylinder    is   principally exposed to heat, this may be
                                            N
double.
   " With the wire safe-lamp or guarded candle the miner may
explore all parts of the mine where explosive mixtures exist, and
the state of the flame will show him the degree of contamination
of the air. As the fire-damp mixes with the air the flame will
enlarge.      When the fire-damp has reached its explosive point
his cylinder will be filled with flame but the flame of his wick
                                            ;
will appear within the flame of the fire-damp. As the inflam
 mable gas increases in quantity the flame of the lamp will disap
 pear, and the flame in his cylinder will become paler      ;   and this
 ought to be   a   signal to him to leave that part of the workings,

way, yet it cannot be breathed safely for any time.
    "I found that sparks from steel and flint fell red, and with
out scintillation, in a mixture of coal gas in which a cylinder
lamp had burnt out ; and they appeared equally dull and red in
a mixture of three parts of air and one part of coal gas ; so that
the light of a steel mill would not be sufficient to work by in an
atmosphere in which the cylinder lamp was extinguished, and it
could only be employed to guide the miner out of an atmosphere
which it would be fatal to breathe for a continuance.
    " To conclude : there appears every reason to expect that the
safe light, in this state of improvement, with proper attention,
will enable the miner to work with perfect security in parts of
the mines most liable to fire-damp, and that it will not only pre
serve him from, but enable him to combat and subdue, his most
dangerous enemy.       Confined in the wire-gauze safe-lamp, the
flame of the fire-damp will be divested of all its terrors, and
made to expend energies formerly so destructive, in producing
an useful light.

r   "A  considerable degree of beat is always produced by the combustion of
the explosive fire-damp in the wire-gauze cylinders; therefore a candle
soon melts away in the lantern, when the fire-damp is burning in it; and if
candles are used with the wire-gauze safe-guard, the flame of the fire-damp
should be extinguished by putting a woollen or linen extinguisher over the
cylinder, to prevent the candle from dropping^out, or the candle should be
 secured in the bottom of the lantern, by a safety screw: where the fire
damp is known to exist, it will, however, always be better to work with
small lamps, which may be fed with tallow; and where the object is to de
stroy the fire-damp speedily, a large cylinder lamp with double wire-gauze
may be used.

solder, and there should alwavs he a handle at the bottom, or a ring at the

Elements     of Electricity and Electro- Chemistry. By Georgb
    John    Singer.      1 vol. 8vo. with Plates      by Lowry, 507 pp.
    Longman and Co.           Price  1 6s.
    The rapid progress of electrical discovery since the invention
of the battery of Volta, and the present importance of electri
city as an essential branch of chemical philosophy, are circum
stances which render an elementary work on this subject adapted
to the-existing state of knowledge, an acquisition of real value :
and as the brilliant series of discoveries which have so eminentlv
 distinguished the commencement of the 19th century have not
before appeared in any regular treatise on electricity, we no
tice with pleasure the successful endeavours of Mr. Singer to
lessen the difficulties and promote the cultivation of an interest
ing department of science by a clear and comprehensive state
ment of its most essential facts.
    The author has paid very considerable attention to the ar
 rangement of his subject, and by this means has effectually
promoted his object of rendering it more familiar.              We extract
the following remark on this subject from the preface to the
work.      "  By a proper attention to arrangement I have been
enabled to communicate a more extensive collection of facts in
a single volume, than is to be found in any existing treatise with
which I am acquainted ; and that attention may be expected to
render even rriore_ concise statements amply intelligible; for ma
 terials thus disposed are like the combination of stones in an
arch ; they mutually support each other, and form a connected
 series in which every part is essential to the existence of the
whole."
    The details in this work are certainly more intelligible and
less prolix than in the majority of those on the same subject
which have come under our observation ; and yet they involve a
more extensive series of phsenomena.             This advantage is most
probably derived partly from the extensive practice of the author
as a lecturer, and partly from the assiduous attention which he
 has paid to the science from a very early age.             The subject is
 introduced by a historical sketch of the principal epochs of dis
 covery, which is calculated to prepare the reader for the scien

53                   Notices respecting New Books.
 tine exposition of the science.     The work itself is divided into
four parts, which are again subdivided into chapters.        The first
part describes " electrical phaenomena and the circumstance!
essential to their production."        This part is divided into five
chapters, arranged as follows :
    Chap. I. Nature of electrical action and sources of electrical
excitation ; positive and negative electricity.
    Chap. II. Of conductors and non-eonductors of electricity,
 and of the electrical apparatus.
    Chap. III. Experiments with the electrical machine. — Theory
of its action. — Phaenomena of attraction and recession.
    Chap. IV. On the phaenomena of electric light.
    Chap. V. On the Leyden jar and the nature of electrical
influence.
    This part of the work is chiefly remarkable for the distinct
arrangement which it presents, and for a careful selection of
experiments which are explained very clearly by a judicious mo
dification of Dr. Franklin's theory. The distinguishing charac
ters of electrical action are described as consisting in the at
traction of light substances and the emission of light, the re
pulsion or separation observed between electrified substances
being ascribed by the author to the attraction of the surrounding
air or other medium, and not to any repulsive power, the existence
of which, he asserts, is purely hypothetical.      In this opinion he
is supported by the authority of Kinnersley, Morgan, Volta, and
De Luc, and by the experiments of Lord Stanhope, and it cer
tainly renders the explanation of many phenomena much more
simple and satisfactory.
    The chief sources of electrical phaenomena are ; 1st, Friction.
2d, Change of form.      3d, Change of temperature.        4th, Con
tact of dissimilar bodies.   It is the last which our author con
siders as in all cases the primary cause of electrical excitation ;
for it occurs in all the others ; and in the most simple case of
electrical action, that of De Luc's electrical column, the contact
of dissimilar bodies is the only known cause of the effects pro
duced.
    In the table of the effects of excitation, some corrections of
the results given by Cavallo are made ; but the author has not
rendered it either so complete or perfect as we were led to ex
pect from our knowledge of the extent of his experience.
    A variety of experiments are adduced to prove that positive
and negative electricity are always produced together, and the
phaenomena resulting from the action of a Nairn's machine are
minutely described as affording the following indications :
    1 . That the cause   of electricity is corporeal ; for sensation
is affected by it, and   amechanical impulse   is  experienced.
                                                            2. That

                    Notices respecting New Books.                   59
     2. That there is a mutual action between the electricities ex
cited in the opposite conductors, since their effects are more
powerful when directed at the same time to our conducting
body.
     3. That the same relation which        is observed between the
opposite     conductors   exists  also between    either of them and
the ground, but in a different degree.        From these phaenomena
the following propositions are deduced :
     1 . The cause of electrical phaenomena    is material, and pos
sesses the properties of an elastic fluid.
     2. The electric fluid attracts and is attracted by all other
matter, and in consequence of such attraction exists in all known
 substances.
     3. The attraction of different bodies for the electric fluid is
various, and so is that of the same body under different circum
stances : consequently the quantity of electricity naturally exist
ing in different substances may tie unequal; and the same body
may attract more or less than if alone when combined with other
matter : but its original attraction will be restored by destroying
 the artificial combination.
     4. From some peculiarity in the nature of the electric fluid,
 its attraction by and for common matter is more influenced bv
 figure than by mass ; and is consequently stronger in extensive
 than in limited surfaces.
     5. From the same peculiarity, the electric fluid moves with
 great facility over the surface or through the substance of some
 bodies,, and is arrested in its progress by others.
     6. When the attraction of any substance for electricity is equal
 to the electric fluid it contains, that substance will evince no elec
 trical signs ; but these are immediately produced when there is
 either more or less electric fluid than is adequate to the satura
 tion of the existing attraction : if there be more, the electrical
 signs will be positive ; if less, they will be negative.
     This leads to the following theory of excitation.           "The
  bodies employed have each a certain quantity of the electric
  fluid proportioned to their natural attraction for it. This they
 retain, and appear unelectrified so long as they remain in their
 natural state.     Now if two such bodies are brought into con
 tact, their natural attractions are altered, one of them attracts
  more than in its separate state, and the other less; the electric
  fluid diffuses itself amongst them in quantities proportioned to
  their relative attractions, and they consequently appear unelec
  trified. But if they are suddenly separated, the new distribu
  tion of the electric fluid remains, whilst the original attractions
  are restored ; and as these are not equal to each other, the bodies

60                  Notices respecting    New Books.
will appear electrical ; that whose natural attraction was in
creased by contact, having received an addition to its quantity
of electric fluid, will be positively electrified ; and that whose
attraction was lessened, having lost a portion, will be negative."
    The action of the electrical machine is explained very satis
factorily by this theory.       Its effect is to bring successively in
contact with the rubber different parts of the surface of the glass,
which are as suddenly separated from that contact, and carry
with them the electricity they have acquired by the change of
capacity it produces.
    The same theory is applied very naturallv to all the usual ef
fects of electric: motion and the action of different conductors ir»
transmitting electricity : the explanation of points appears to
us novel and appropriate.         It is stated to consist in promoting
the recession of the particles of electrified air, by protruding a
part of the electrical atmosphere of the conductor into a situation
more exposed to the action of the ambient unelectrified medium,
and thereby producing a current of air from the electrified point
to the nearest uninsulated body.
    The phaenomena of electric light are treated at some length,
and explained in a very simple manner ; the Leyden jar, the
condenser, and the electrophorus, are referred to the action of
one principle, that of electrical influence, which has been so well
illustrated by Volta in his excellent paper in the Ixxiid volume
of the Philosophical Transactions.             The explanations differ
essentially   from   those  of most    preceding writers.    The author
uniformly avoids the use of repulsion as a principle of electri-
•al action, but he does not adopt to any extent the opinions
of those who have preceded him in this idea.
    The second part of the work treats of the mechanical and
chemical agencies of electricity, and contains three chapters.
    Chap. 1. describes the instruments required for the applica
tion of the electric power to the purpose of experiment.
    Chap. 2. the mechanical agencies of electricity.
    Chap. 3. chemical effects of electricity.
    The description of instruments is concise ; it includes only
those which are really necessary; it contains much useful infor
mation, and concludes with the following very just remark:
" Tubes of glass, wires of different metals, corks, and a few
other materials, are adequate to the construction of an endless
variety of electrical machinery, and the proper direction of such
resources is constantlv followed by useful discovery.        Mechanical
dexterity   is  therefore  essential to  the character of an  electrician,
since his progress will be in proportion to the facility with which
he can adapt the objects around him to new inquiries.                  He
                                                                  cannot

cannot deviate from the beaten track of his predecessors without
the aid of new combinations ; and when the supply of these is
derived from his own industry and ingenuity, the ardour of his
pursuit will be unimpeded by the delays or mistakes of others ;
and the projection of any required improvement may conse
quently be followed by its immediate consummation."
   In describing the mechanical effects of electricity, Mr. Singer
has particularly enlarged on the expansive effects it invariably
produces when passing from one conductor to another, and has
very successfully applied the observation of this effect to explain
the results obtained by Mr. Svmmer, when a charge is passed
through several sheets of tin-foil placed between the leaves of
a paper book, which were Considered as an indication of the
course of the electric fluid.     As Mr. Singer has published a
separate paper oh this subject in The Philosophical Magazine,
it is unnecessary for us to enter more fully on the subject. The
following experiments will probably be new to many of our
readers.    " Colour both sides of a card with vermilion, and place
it upon the table of the universal discharger ; one of the wires
should be beneath the card, and the other in contact with its
upper side ; the distance of the points of the wires being one
inch. If a charge be now passedxthrough the wires, the fluid
will pass from the positive wire across the surface of the card to
the part over the negative wire, and it will perforate the card
in its passage to the negative wire.     The course of the fluid is
permanently indicated by   a neat  black  line on the card, reaching
from the point of the positive wire to the hole ; and by a dif
fused black mark on the opposite side of the card around the
perforation, and next the negative wire.       These effects are very
constant, the black line always appearing on the side of the
card which is in contact with the positive wire, and the perfora
tion being near the negative wire."
    Mr. Singer has also found that a light float-wheel, made of
card paper, and placed between two oppositely electrified points,
will move from the positive to the negative ; and that a piece of
card paper supported vertically by a narrow cork hase in a si
milar situation, is thrown down also from the positive towards
the negative.
    The experiments appear to us amongst the most satisfactory
that have been offered in evidence of a current of electricity
from the positive to the negative surface, but we do not regard
them as absolutely decisive.
    The chemical agencies of electricity include only the effects
of common electricity, the action of the Voltaic apparatus being
reserved for the concluding part of the work.          The action of
the electric charge on metals is treated at some length, and the
                                                          description

 62                Notices respecting New Books.
 description involves considerable practical information on the
 means of conducting such experiments.           The following is a
 simple means of reviving metals from their oxides :
    " Introduce some oxide of tin into a glass tube, so that when
 the tube is laid horizontally the oxide may cover about half an
inch of its lower internal surface. Place the tube on the table
of the universal discharger, and introduce the pointed wires in
 to its opposite ends, that the portion of oxide may lie between
 them.     Pass several strong charges in succession through the
tube, replacing the oxide in its situation, should it be dispersed.
 If the charges are sufficiently powerful, a part of the tube will
soon be stained with metallic tin, which has been revived by the
 action of the transmitted electricity.
    The decomposition of water and the action of electricity on
 different gases are also fully described, and are accompanied by
 a table of the results of electrifying mixed gases ; and another on
the action of electricity on compound gases.        On the causes of
these phenomena, which the author does not attempt to ex
plain, he has the following observations :
    " These various effects produced by the same agency do not
 appear susceptible of any other explanation than that which as
sumes the action of electricity to be mechanical ; and even on
this assumption they are not strictly intelligible.    The momen
tary agitation into which the various mediums are thrown by
the action of the spark, might be considered as likely to pro
mote a new arrangement of parts ; but, admitting this, why is
the change instantaneous in some instances, and gradual in
others ?    And by what inversion of principle is the same impulse
that unites the particles of bodies, enabled subsequently to se
parate them ? These are questions it would be interesting to
resolve ; but there appears no clue by which such intricate pro
cesses can be at present analysed.        The chemist must therefore
be content to avail himself of the practical advantages they af
ford to his art, and await the progress of discovery for the de
velopment of their theoretical relations."
    An enumeration of the bodies which are rendered phospho
rescent by electricity, with remarks on that singular phenomenon,
and a sketch of the magnetic effects of electricity, close this part
of the work, which the chemical student will find a very in
teresting and instructive exercise.

       The size of the Map will be three feet two inches, by two feet
   one inch ; including, in longitude, from the Meridian of London
   to the Eastern Boundary of Persia ; and in latitude, from the
   Northern Coast of Africa to the Southern Shores of the Baltic and
   Middle Regions of Russia, which contains all that is essentially
  necessary to illustrate a Course of History from the first colonial
   migrations of mankind, to the overthrow of the Roman Empire,

       The projection of the Map is the globular, which best pre
   serves the proportion of the different countries ; and it was care
   fully divided into half degrees throughout, in order to lay down
   the coasts, rivers, mountains, &c. the more accurately, and to

     Mr. C. Taylor has commenced the publication of       " Egypt,"
consisting of
                 "a  series of 100 engravings exhibiting the anti
quities, architecture, inhabitants, costume, hvcroglyphics, ani
mals, scenery, &c. of that country, with accompanying descrip
tions and explanations in French and English.          Selected from
the celebrated work detailing the expedition of the French, by
Baron Vivant Denon."
     The engravings are executed by Middiman, Cardon, Cooke,
 Roffe, &c. The work is to be comprised in twenty numbers,
large folio, at five shillings each.    Three numbers of this splendid
 and highly curious work have already appeared, and their con
tents and execution cannot fail to obtain public approbation.
 To astronomers the curious planisphere in the Temple of Tentyris
 must lie peculiarly interesting, as it proves " that the Egyptians
 had a planetary system, and that their knowledge of the heavens
 was reduced to principles."         Egyptian locks, which fastened
 the gate of a town, the door of a house, or the smallest box or
 drawer, furnish specimens of these ancient people's skill in me
 chanics ; while the portraits of the different distinguished cha
 racters which Denon had so good an opportunity of taking in
 Egypt, will amuse all persons of taste and inquiry respecting
 human character and physiognomy.

     Several attempts have been made to reduce a knowledge of
 the science of chemistry into a tabular form, but many disco
  veries have been made, and the whole system considerably mo
 dified, since their publication.    Mr. Crowe, therefore, in availing
 himself of preceding works, arranging the subjects somewhat
 more simply, and including all the recent discoveries, has con
 tributed to facilitate the acquisition and recollection of this most
  interesting science.      He divides his Chart into three sections :
  the first describes the earths and metals ; the second treats of
  simple or undecompounded substances ; and the third, of com
  pound combustibles.       In a distinct compartment the author has
 arranged a very distinct view of the minerals, vegetable and
 animal acids, which will be found very convenient for common
   reference.

  upon the 31st of March the first number of a Quarterly Journal of
  Science and the Arts, and that it will be regularly continued upon
  the last days of March, June, September, and December.          This
  Journal will contain a series of original communications upon
  subjects connected with science and the arts, and with philoso
  phical literature in general.     Notices of scientific discoveries
  and inventions, and of experiments and researches carried on in
  the Institution.   Reviews and notices of scientific works.     Abs

  of the members of the Royal Institution, and of the public and
  other courses of lectures.
     The name of Mr. Brande, of the Royal Institution, to whom
  communications are requested to be addressed, is a pledge that
 this work will be conducted on liberal and enlightened princi
 ples ; and we hope it will meet with due encouragement.

  Extract of     a French  Work    entitled "L'Optique des Cou-
     leurs," (the Optics of Colours).     By Father Castel, a Je
     suit.
     I know a painter whose taste and talent in portrait-painting I
 esteem very much, and who, in showing me his painting-room,
 which was very poor in colours, made me expressly observe, that
 there was neither carmine, nor lake, nor vermilion for the reds,
 nor any lively yellow; but simply Prussian blue for the blues
 and greens, a brown' red for all sorts of reds and violets, and a
very indifferent yellow, the name of which I have forgotten.
    His portraits were very fine. His flesh colours were more
especially very natural, very lively, and verv bright even, when it
was required.
    I reasoned with him, and objected to him that other celebrated
painters did not fail to employ the most lively reds and the
brightest yellows.     He agreed with me that paintings thus co
loured, more particularly with red, were much in fashion.          He
brought me back, however, to truth and to immortality.         Those
colours, he observed to me, are false : nature is lively by con
trast alone, and by the judgement she displays.       All her colours
are but indifferent in the detail of each trait ; but it is the op
position which brings out her productions, and gives them life,
fire, and the greatest eclat.    He added that lake, carmine, ver-

milion, and other sharp colours, had not any body, and did not
hold for a long timer observing that those who employed them
did not work for immortality.
   These lively colours are in reality too pure: to give them body
and consistence, and at the same time to imitate       nature — beau
tiful nature — they should be soiled.
   From all these observations I am of opinion, that to paint and
dye with effect, or, in a word, to colour scientifically and on re
gular principles, such as I think are here developed or sketched
by me, all the reds, such as lake, carmine, and vermilion, the
red brown, minium even, should be taken in the mass, and by
their admixture an universal red produced.
    The just proportions of this mixture would be found by de
grees, and indeed very soon.        It would certainly form a very
fine red — an intermediate red, tempered, primitive, full, em
bodied, harmonious, certain, and durable.         I am led to think
that   the  brown  red should predominate,    and  constitute its body
and principal basis.
   The same may be tried on the blues and yellows : there would
thus be tluee good colours, from which all descriptions of pure
and dingy tiuts of colouring would be produced, by blending
them two by two, or all the three.
   A dark colour bordering on black might even be procured by
this mixture ; and who knows but that a white, or whitish gray,
may not be formed by blending certain colours naturally clear,
such as are to be found among the yellows, and even in a certain
degree among the reds ?
    From art let us proceed to nature.      I have observed that the
greater part of the colours employed by her wisely sparing
hand are also dingy colours, into the composition of which
many kinds of colours enter.      It is very rare to find in flowers,
in shells, and more particularly in animals, true simple colours,
or which do not result from the mixture of more than two sim
ple colours.
   This fact being once ascertained, it was not difficult for me to
enter into the reasons of nature.     In the first place, the physical
and practical reason is the same as I have before assigned, that
every thing on the earth, and within the earth, is much blended;
and that all bodies, plants, minerals, and animals, are in reality
mixed.
    But the causes of design, the final causes of nature, or of her
all-wise Author, merit at least as much or still greater attention.
The pure colours are very limited in their number, the dingy
colours are much more extensive, and form a much greater va
riety — the only source of our delight.
    It is in this way that the verdure of the plains, which may be

thought so monotonous and uniform, is not at all so.             If it were
throughout a fine green, a true green, it would in reality be a
Very insipid monotony.          Nothing, however, is more diversified,
by the different touches of red, violet, and orange, which are
manifestly blended with this green, as if to soil                       it,
                                                                and which

a fine colour which          not contrasted,

if  we view     attentively.
                    it            The  fact is, that  we constantly repre

of the shades, as          they  ifhad   been   the finest colours in the
painting, saying expressly        that he  had   never seen such fine co
lours   as  these    shades.     He   confounded    the brightness which
 they cast on the coloured parts, with the shades themselves.
Whatever contributes to the beauty of any thing, partakes in a
certain degree of this beauty.           This      because every thing

relative, and because         fine conformity renders the beauty reci

 all the ignorant and invidious predictions of inhuman speculators
about its inutility, and demonstrating, what every reasoning man
of science hefore believed, that the invention would be equally
 effectual and practicable.     There      now everv reason to believe
                                              is
 that  Sir IPs plan will be universally adopted without the least
 delay.    No man or society of men, indeed, would now risk the
 responsibility   consequent on an explosion, when the means
 of avoidingit   are both known and so easily adopted.         The pre

smallest number of apertures in         square inch which can be used

gauze with apertures only of .gVth were perfectly secure even
 with the greatest heat. In some of his experiments, Sir Hum

 was found as perfectly secure as a brick wall could have been
 against explosion. — See pages 54         56.&

 amined, and the modes of procuring them in a pure form, and
 of ascertaining their chemical characters, exhibited upon an ex
tended scale. — The lectures on the metals include a succinct
 account of mineralogy, and of the methods of analysing and as
saying ores.
    This part of the courses will also contain a full examination
of pharmaceutical chemistry; the chemical processes of the
Pharmacopoeiae will be particularly described, and compared with
those adopted by the manufacturer.
    The third and fourth divisions relate to organic substances. —
The chemical changes induced by vegetation are here inquired
into ; the principles of vegetables, the theory of fermentation,
and the characters of its products are then examined.
    The chemical history of animals is the next object of inquiry
— it is illustrated by an examination of their component parts,
in health and in disease ; by an inquiry into the chemistry of
the animal functions, and into the application of chemical prin
ciples to the treatment of diseases.
    The courses conclude with an account of the structure of the
earth, of the changes which it is undergoing, of the objects and
Uses of geology, and of the principles of agricultural chemistry.
   The applications of chemistry to the arts and manufactures,
and to ceconomical purposes, are discussed at some length in
various parts of the courses ; and the most important of them
are experimentally exhibited.
   The Admission Fee to each Course is Four Guineas ; or by
paying Eight Guineas, gentlemen are entitled to attend for an
unlimited time.
   Further particulars maybe obtained by applying to Mr. Brande
or to Mr. Fincher at the Royal Institution, 21, Albemarle-Street.

 JL he Natural History Society of Geneva has invited the na
turalists of the whole of Switzerland to attend a public meeting
at Geneva, in order to lay the foundation of a general society un
der the name of "The Helvetic Societyfor the Natural Sciences."
   M. Badeigts Laborde, a seafaring gentleman 6f the depart
ment of the Landes in France, has ascertained by repeated ex
periments, that the resinous trees of France are capable of
yielding rosin and tar not inferior in quality to those which are
brought from the north of Europe at a great expense.          M. La
borde has also ascertained that the French products contain the
tame constituent parts with those of Sweden ; and that their
inferiority is entirely owing to the imperfection of the furnaces
in which they are prepared, their defective preparation, and their
mixture with a certain quantity of water and heterogeneous
matters, and particularly from the want of essential oil, which is
burnt in the French operation for extracting rosin and tar.
Finally, it is easy to purify the French articles so as to render
them equally perfect, and at the same time far cheaper than
those of Sweden.
    The public will be gratified to learn, that the British Ministers
are prepared to avail themselves    of the opportunity afforded by
the restoration of peace, to attend to the interest of science,
and add to the stock of general knowledge.        A small expedition
is now about to proceed to explore the course of the Congo, in
the south of Africa.      A transport, accompanied by a steam
boat, will proceed to the mouth of the river, where it will re
main while the last-mentioned vessel is dispatched to follow the
course of the Congo, to ascertain how far it is navigable, and
the character of the inhabitant* of its shores ; as also that of the

                    (the vessel which is to proceed up the river is so
named)     does  not   draw more than four feet of water.       When it
shall be found impracticable to proceed further in her, the un
dertaking will be confided to two small cutters which are joined
together, the masts and sails being stacked between them so as
to leave the navigators the full range of each, and these will not
draw more than eighteen inches of water.            Such arrangements
give fair promises of ultimate success; but that which gives us
most hope is the care taken to man this little expedition in the
best possible manner.         The hands to be employed, in number
about 50,     are  all  volunteers.   None but those who are proved
most efficient are accepted.        Their exertions are stimulated by
 double pay.      The officers are selected for their merit alone, and
promotion is promised to those who mav return.             A trial of the
vessels above mentioned, which are intended to be employed for
the purposes above described, wilj shortly take place on the
 Thames.      They will leave England early in the present month
under the command of Captain Tuckey.              It is expected it will
take from eighteen months to two years to accomplish the ob
jects of the voyage. Some natives of that part of Africa have
volunteered their services, and, it is highly probable, will prove
of great advantage.         One represents himself as born more than
300 miles up the Congo, at a village on the banks of that river ;
and another as still further up.       They speak the native language
with fluency, as also English, and, it is said, have given some

probably recollect that Dr'. Balfour of Edinburgh published in
 1814, in the Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal, two re
markable cases of adhesion of amputated fingers.              A similar

bv the following interesting communication          to Dr. Balfour by
Thomas Hunter, Esq. Surgeon, Port Glasgow.
    " January 6, 1815. — John Galbreath, aged 45, by trade a
house-carpenter, in the act of hewing wood with an axe (which
 he held in his left hand) struck off his thumb close to the arti
culation of the first phalanx with the metacarpal bone.         Being
confused by the accident, he covered the stump with his other
hand, and, accompanied by the foreman of the work, arrived
about eight minutes after at my house.          Upon examining the
parts, I found the portion of thumb he had supposed cut off,
 lying in the hollow of his hand, buried in coagulated blood, and
 still attached by a portion of skin not exceeding one-eighth of
 an inch in breadth.
     " Had I not been acquainted, through the medium of the
 Edinburgh Medical Journal, of your success in re-uniting sepa
 rated parts, I certainly without the least hesitation would have
 cast this part from me, and proceeded to dress the stump ; but.
 I resolved on saving it if possible.
     " Having carefully cleaned the parts, and removed a small
 splinter of bone, I replaced them, securing them with three
 stitches.    After covering the thumb with dressing-lint, I placed
 a splint of wood above all, extending from the wrist to a little
 beyond the point of the thumb, and secured the whole, as neatly
 as possible, with a narrow ribbon.        Finally, wetting the whole
 with tinctur.   benzoin,  comp.   I ordered  him to call frequently,
 that I might have the opportunity of ascertaining whether ad
 hesion would take place.
     " 1 examined the parts daily. He felt no pain — no discharge
 took place ; no smell was perceivable.        In this way he passed
 the time without ever having the first dressing touched, till the
 twentieth day from the accident, when I became so anxious to
 see the parts, that I undressed the hand, and, to my great satis
 faction, found all skinned, one place, where there was a stitch,
 excepted. This was dressed daily, and soon healed.         The splint
  of wood was continued for some time after, to give support to
  the bone.     The man has been working for some months past,
  enjoying all the advantages of his thumb, only the motion of
  the joint is impaired.
      " The above is a just statement of the case, and the patient
  signs it with the hand that suffered the injury.

                                    THE BAZAAR.
        The origin and commencement of such                an establishment   in
     London    deserves  to be recorded.    The greater part of our read
      ers must have seen some account of it in the daily newspapers ;
      cur notice shall therefore be brief at present. When more com
      pletely matured, and the whole put in motion, we may again re
     turn to it.
         The British Bazaar owes its origin exclusivelv to the actfva
     benevolence and philanthropy of John Trotter, Esq. of Soho-
      Square, a gentleman well known in the higher circles, and to
>    whom the nation owes many arrangements which have so
     much improved the circumstances of the British army when on
     active service in the field.      Mr. T /otter has not merely the
     merit of contriving and arranging the establishment — but of
     providing the entire means for carrying it into full operation. The
     name adopted      is,as our readers know, applied         the East to
                                                                in
     large markets, many of them covered, in which the merchants
     expose their goods to sale*; different portions being occupied
     by different traders.      Mr. Trotter has devoted his extensive
     premises in Soho-Square to the accommodation of an extensive,
     industrious, hut distressed class of the community, whose narrow
     circumstances keep them in obscurity, and preclude the possi
     bility of their exhibiting for sale, in shops of their own, the va
     rious products of their industry.      He Las fitted them up in the
    most commodious and.elegant manner, with counters, drawers,
     &c. With the lighting, warming, ventilating, and watching
    the premises the temporary occupiers will have no concern but         ;
    are to pay    by the length of counter they may respectively oc
     cupy,   at the low  rate of one-fourth part of     shilling per foot,

    for each day they may require the accommodation.           When their
    little stock  issold off their expenses terminate— the family pre
    pare   a  new supply — they know where they may be again ac
    commodated, and where no recommendation              wanted but that
                                                           is
    of an irreproachable character.
        So far as regards general accommodation, collecting the va
    rious productions of art and ingenuity into one focus, and the
    civility and beneficial rivalry excited     such an assemblage, the

    bable that some of those extensive ruins still left at Palmyra, and other
    ancient cit es now desolate, which have been hitherto considered as tem
    ples, or the palaces of royalty, are the remains of covered Bazaars.    The
    term Bazaar  is   neither more nor less than the Hebrew word          which
    means to scatter, to disperse — applied in Arabic to the merchant, the dit-
    pertcr, and hence to the place for the dispersion of his commodities.

not only to every large town in the British dominions,               but
throughout Europe.
                              ANTIQUITIES.
    Rome, Oct. 28. — There has just been found upon the Ap^
penine Way an ancient sun-dial, drawn upon marble, with the
names of the winds in Greek.          It is exactly calculated for the
latitude of Rome.       According to local circumstances, it is con
cluded to be the discus belonging to Herodius Atticus, and de
scribed by Vitruvius.
                               JERUSALEM.
    We understand that an artist of acknowledged respectability
and talent is now occupied with an undertaking eminently cal
culated to assist the antiquary in his researches upon the subject
of biblical antiquities ; namely, a picture of the site of Ancient
Jerusalem and the surrounding country, as now seen from the
Mount of Olives. The picture is to be submitted to public view
for a short time preparatory to the publication of a series of
plates, accompanied by appropriate descriptions.
    The painting exceeds 100 feet in length, and its elevation is
 18 feet.
    The pipes of the engines used in France for extinguishing fire
are made of flax, and are found to answer the purpose much
better than those made of leather.        They are woven in the same
manner as the wicks of patent lamps, and can be made of any
length without a seam or joining.         When the water runs a short
time through the pipes the flax swells and no water escapes,
though the pressure be very great.         They are more portable, not
so liable to be out of repair, and do not cost by one half so much
as the leather ones used in this country.           This article is now
manufactured in Glasgow.

   Sir, — Allow    me to call the attention of your readers to the
consideration    of  the following singular property which I have
lately discovered   is  possessed by that useful substance sulphur.

 XVII.    On Aerial Navigation.     By Sir George Cavley, Bart.
                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —    I am glad to find that the public attention is called to
 aerial navigation by Mr. Evans, in your Magazine for November
 last.   This subject is of great importance to mankind, and is
 worthy ot more attention than is bestowed upon it. An unin
 terrupted navigable ocean, that comes to the threshold of every
 man's door, ought not to be neglected as a source of human
 gratification and advantage.     Mr. Evans proposes the action of
 a large inclined plane suspended below a common balloon, as
 the meaus of making it take an oblique' course in its ascent, and
 by means of the same plane to make the weight of the appa
 ratus cause an oblique descent towards the same point of steer
 age.    This principle is unquestionably capable of performing
 what that gentleman proposes, although the construction he has
 given is only adapted to effect the purpose in ascending, as the
 want of weight in the plane would prevent it from operating,
 excepting in a very limited degree, in the descent.     In the small
 balloons used by Mr. Evans, the plane was, in fact, the whole
burthen supported ; and hence, under the small velocity gene
 rated, the descent was as oblique as the ascent.         But in the
 balloon 80 feet in diameter described bv that gentleman, the
 plane in ascending would receive, according to his estimate,
 above 2000 pounds of resistance from the airi and thus become
 efficient ; whereas in descending it could only sustain a resist
 ance equal to its weight, which of course will be as little as pos
 sible, and hence it will be nearly inefficient.  The general prin
ciple, however, is perfectly true; and when applied advantageously,
 although it is an indirect way of gaining the proposed horizontal
 point, yet it will be as effectual as the process of tacking in or
 dinary navigation.      Mr. Evans estimates that a Montgolfier
 balloon of 80 feet in diameter, with a plane suspended under it
 in an angle of 70° with a perpendicular line, the dimensions of
 which are as 1'4 to 1, compared with the great circle of the
 balloon, will be carried through the air by a power of ascent
-equal to 2792 pounds with a velocity of 28 feet per second, and
  hence that the travelling horizontal speed will be about 19 miles
 per hour. — If the resistance of air be taken at one pound per
 square foot at a velocity of 23 feet per second, which is two feet
 more than the common engineering estimate, the resistance of
 a globe to its great circle, according to Mr. Robins's experi
 ments, as 1 to 2-27, and the resistance of the plane as the square

of the    sine of the angle of incidence, — it will require about
12450 pounds to produce this rate of conveyance in Mr. Evans's
balloon; and hence the power he allows is not one-fourth part
of what is required.      This apparatus would, however, according:
to my calculation, travel with the speed of about 8f miles per
hour*, which is quite sufficient to show the utility of the princi
ple, whether the mistake be in Mr. Evans's figures or my own.
    A few years ago I made many experiments upon the power
of inclined planes, some of which exceeded 300 square feet in
area: an account of these may be seen in Mr. Nicholson's Jour
nal for November 1809, and February and March 1810. "it
may be affirmed with confidence from these experiments, that in,
obliquely descending the efficacy and steerage of the inclined
plane have been completely ascertained. Mv object was to leave
out the unwieldy bulk of balloons altogether, and to make use
of the inclined plane propelled by a light first mover. Although
my attention has hitherto been diverted from making further
experiments, I am fully convinced that this 'mode of aerial na
vigation is practicable, and will, ere long, be accomplished.       In
the mean time I shall be glad to promote any promising ex
periments upon the steerage of balloons, and therefore offer the
following observations through the medium of your Magazine.
    In considering the means for obviating the relative resistance
of balloons in passing swiftly through the air, the leading ge
neral principle is evidently to increase their dimensions far be
yond the limits hitherto adopted.       The weight of their super
ficial materials,   and the resistance they meet with, being as the
squares of their diameters; whereas their power of support be
ing as the cubes of these diameters, it follows that their power
may be made to bear any required proportion to their resistance.
Thus a balloon of one yard in diameter meets with ten times
more resistance, in proportion to its power, than a balloon of ten
yards in diameter.
    The next consideration     is,that globe
                                         a    is   by
                                                    no means the best
shape   for  obviating  resistance   ; greater extension
                                         a                   the line
                                                            in
of its path, with corresponding diminution in the section per
                     a
pendicular to  it,  may be adopted with great advantage. Keeping
in view these two leading- principles, the former of which places
the proper scale of experiments beyond the expense that indivi
duals choose to appropriate to such purposes,           propose that
                                                        I

                                         those desirous of promoting
this noble art — First, that a subscription be entered into for

obtaining   a proper   fund ; — and secondly, that a committee be
appointed by the subscribers for the purpose of carrying such
experiments as may appear eligible into effect.       To such a com
mittee I should be glad to submit the propriety of making the
following experiment, which would be capable of trying all the
expedients hitherto proposed for steering balloons.         The prin
ciple proposed by     Mr.  Evans  is only applicable,   at present, to
fire-balloons ; and as these are the cheapest, and upon a large
scale with proper precautions may be made safe with respect to
fire, I propose that the experiments be made upon the Mont-
golfier balloon.    The scale I propose to adopt, though as small
as is compatible with the object in view, will appear to any one
who has not calculated the proportions required for the success
of the experiment, of stupendous magnitude. — Amazement would
have been the consequence of presenting to the imagination of
an ancient Briton the idea of a British hundred-gun ship, when
only contemplating the principles of navigation exhibited in his
humble coracle covered with a skin. From the truck of the
flag-staff to the extreme of the bowsprit, a vessel of this sort
will measure about 90 yards ; and it is a wonderful effort of hu
man ingenuity arising from the gradually accumulating know
ledge of ages : — but the long boat of aerial navigation com
mences about the bulk where the man-of-war of common navi
gation has reached its full growth; and what may be the vessels,

                                                                 ;
some explanation.         The exterior resistance of the air to the an
terior portion of the balloon, will amount on some parts of                to            it
about 26 pounds per square yard at the proposed speed                    and        ;
hence an internal pressure at least equal to this must be created,
for the purpose of preserving the form of the balloon. This.                                  is
most readily effected by force of the long column of heated air
passing up such          chimney as

                                                                      ;

loon, the 27 yards of chimney added to half the height of the
balloon would create           pressure rather exceeding what
                                   a                                      re            is

   *This calculation      grounded upon the following data: — That
                             is                                         Mont-      in

to some careful experiments of my own upon a very large scale.

scarcely necessary to observe that the balloon must be, as usual,
furnished with a large valve at the top, and likewise with one at
the bottom, to permjt the escape or the hottest or coldest air as
required.      If the specific heat of air be to that of water as 1'79
to 1, it will requite about 880 pounds of fuel to inflate this bal
loon, exclusive of what will be consumed to supply the waste of
heat during the operation ; and when a second rise is required,
by having suffered the escape of air equal to the power of 6800
pounds, it will require the rapid combustion of 340 pounds of
shavings, chopped straw, &c. to create a renewed ascent. Hence,
including waste, probably about 100 pounds of fuel will be ex
pended for every mile of conveyance, exclusive of the first in
flation.
     When this experiment has been made, it will be easy to try
whether the balloon can be driven directly forward by sails wafted
by the steam-engine at a less expense of fuel.            In the former
case the balloon had to proceed along two sides of a right-an
gled triangle only to gain the length of the hvpothenuse : hence,
as the resistance varies as the square of the velocity, the same
horizontal speed of conveyance will be obtained with rather less
than half the resistance in the one case than the other.              The
consumption of a steam horse power is about 30 pounds of wa
ter and six or seven pounds of fuel per hour.           I have made se
veral calculations relative to this subject, but it will occupy too
much space for any one number of your valuable Magazine to
detail them ; I shall therefore close this paper, already perhaps
too long, by stating, that if the dread of fire should deter any
one from wishing to promote tins experiment, notwithstanding
the adoption of woollen cloth to prevent               it,

the ratio of 2'6 to   1.    The resistance to steam-balloon will be
                                                   a

 arise upon the introduction of steam into balloons, the chief of
 which are the necessitv of doubling the structure, so as to sus

XVIII. An       Attempt to draw a Parallel between               the Arts of
                        Painting and Sculpture*.
The       appellation of Sister Arts is generally given to Painting and
Sculpture: this mode of expression taken in a general sense is
correct ; but the relations and resemblances which they respec
tively present to the eyes of a common observer are very remote,
when they are considered attentively and with the eyes of an
artist.
    Several eminent artists and amateurs, whom I have the ho
nour to rank among my friends, having expressed their sur
prise that very little had been written upon sculpture, while
the most petty scribbler thinks himself qualified to decide dog
matically on the merit of painters, and to dwell pedantically
on all the parts of a picture; it occurred to me that the rea
sons for such a seeming neglect of the former art, and such an
excess of criticism on the latter, were to be sought for in the
 essence of the two arts.           In these few pages I shall therefore
 endeavour to give a general idea of bothr
    Painting strikes the senses most forcibly, and the aid of co
lours gives it the advantage of closely resembling nature. Not
 only do the abundance and &clat of its productions diffuse it
 more widely and facilitate its reception in the world ; but the
 means of its execution are so familiar and so well known, that
 all men regard it as a common property.                But it is not in this
 point of view, nor in this spirit, that it is made for all the world.
     Sculpture, more confined to the workshop, less in view and of
 more difficult removal, slower in its operations and less extensive

                                                                           in

             a Parallel between Painting and Sculpture.          87
in its field of composition, not only curtails, and as it were shut*
"up, but obscures the career which is always open with respect
to painting, against narrow minds and professed boasters.
    The facility of speaking and the silence above alluded to are,
therefore, wholly dependent on the nature of each of these arts.
 I am the more anxious to communicate these ideas on painting
 and sculpture, because those who practise them evince no desire
 to know that the labour and execution, the methods of which
as transmitted from master to scholar are adopted in the school,
to say the truth, are a kind of routine which may have advan
 tages for men of middling talents, whose habitudes induce idle
ness. But this routine and this beaten track are not only ene
 mies to greatness, but lead artists to despise theory, and reject
 the reflections which men of letters may chance to communicate.
 This prejudice, the source of the greatest misfortunes to the arts,
is absolutely false in its principle.
    The slightest reflection teaches us that the theory of an art
always serves to the perfection of its practice ; and artists them
selves prove every day that these parts are inseparable : in fact,
those of superior talents would not retain the pre-eminence
 which they enjoy, without the application of the essential parts
of theory to the beauty of the touch of the chisel, the perfection
of the tracings, and general grandeur of idea. I shall admit that
it may not be requisite that they should reason methodically on
their art, or write upon it with order : all this may not be re
quired of them ; but they ought to be able to speak of it cor
rectly, and with decent warmth : in short, they ought to be lu
minous.     Could they have these advantages, if this theory which
they despise were not indelibly but unconsciously rooted in their
minds ? It does exist there certainly, but mixed and confounded
with what they call their practice. We may be the more assured
that the theory is nothing but the rationale of the art, because
artists continually use it without having the least doubt of its
potency : in fact, they both oppose it incessantly to the critiques
 which are made on their productions, and use it in those which
they make themselves on the works of ancient or modern artists.
    In order that sculpture may be brought within the compre
hension of persons in general, who have no idea of the resources
of intellect and dexterity of workmanship requisite for its opera
tions, I think it best to compare all its parts with those of
 painting; to point out the portions which are common to both,
 and which establish their sisterhood ; and, finally, to notice the
facilities or difficulties which both kinds of artists have to en
counter.     This arrangement appears to me to be the simplest,
and the most capable of making known the real difference of the
 two arts.
                                   F  4                        Their

88*                     An Attempt     to draw
    Their common parent is Genius, that portion of the divinity
impossible to be misunderstood and more impossible to define,
which strikes, produces, illuminates, creates, and cannot be con
founded with any part of the human mind, which is always little
in its presence.     This universal agent hovers equally over the
two professions,   and  diffuses, more or less, sparks of fire from
his luminous centre :  —  happy are those artists who are sufficiently
prompt to receive them, and sufficiently skilful to make the pro
per application.
    The imitation of nature is constantly the essence, the basis,
the property, and finally the common mother of the two arts :
hut imitation alone produces mere pieces of ice ; it is but a
slave, if genius refuses to accompany it : it is genius which fur
nishes the grand means which lead to expression — to genius we
owe that penetration into the object, and that just and accurate
transport with which the soul is affected, and which flows from
the representation of action itself.
    Painting and sculpture equallv require the influence . of a
father and a mother, to whom they owe the existence, or rather
the reproduction, of every instant of their being. Nevertheless,
far from sharing their gifts to their favourite daughters by the
same ways, genius and imitation subject them not only to their
particular object, but to the means which may exalt the magni
ficence of their sources, and beget an admiration which ought to
be ascribed to its principle.    Another object still more worthy of
these divine essences, is that of transmitting to posterity great
examples of heroism and virtue.          Men who are truly wise and
trulv heroic have, perhaps, no desire to be encouraged by the
honourable recompenses which the arts distribute; but those
who succeed them may be guided and warmed by this reward
of good actions.      Thus we may assert, that the monuments of
 antiquity have often been the- source of the greatest virtues;
for it is evident that living or too recent examples do not make
the same impression as the works of sculpture dedicated by an
 tiquity to virtue and glory: — the latter present an isolated ex
 ample purified from every defect which could obscure it ; the
 former, i.e. the models of living or too recent characters, lose all
 their eclat ; while their value is diminished by the self-love of
 men who do not like to be surpassed by their contemporaries,
 and who receive those personal impressions, those national ideas,
 and finally imbibe all those prejudices, which the mind shuts
 out with the Utmost difficulty as a consequence of these truths.
 The arts ought to draw from antiquity the examples necessary
 for humanity.
    I trust that this digression will be forgiven, as I am here in
 quiring into the merits of an art which men in all ages have
                                                              charged

          a   Parallel between Tainting and Sculpture.            89
charged to transmit to posterity just ideas of the grandeur of
the virtues and the strength of empires. — I now return to the
details which I have undertaken.
   Painting possesses ample means of making itself undertood :
the aid of local and aerial perspective, the multiplicity of plans,
aptness of site, facility of accessories, the instant of every move
ment, all real and, imaginary positions, and finally the colour
of the objects represented. What are the limits of all these ad
vantages when they are guided by the hand of genius ?           This
inquiry does not belong to this place. The above enmeration
is merely given, that all the privations under which sculpture la
bours may be amply perceived.
    Sculpture can only represent figures holding firmly by the
ground, from being obliged to have recourse almost always to
supports capable of sustaining the limbs and enabling them to
resist the weight of the body. What I say on this occasion re
gards single figures only, and which are most usuallv treated by
sculpture.    It is true that groups are sometimes exhibited, but
in general the number of figures of which they are composed
is small ; for it is rare to find them more extensive than that of
Dirce, that which we call the Furnese Bull, or the Baths of
ylpollo at Versailles.    Bas-reliefs furnish sculpture with several
of the parts which painting uses at pleasure: they afford the
means of representing surrounding scenery, landscape, multi
plications of plans, and consequently of perspective        The bas-
relief has besides the advantage of giving an idea of the kind
of light and the point of view for which the sculptor has com
posed his piece.     I shall add that, like the painter, he has only
a surface to adorn, that he may express actions varied at plea
sure, and that he may arrange at will all the positions of nature
and fiction. Notwithstanding this increase of succours, each art
being retained within the limits which its essence prescribes to
it, these kinds of work are in several respects always inferior to
painting, and bas-reliefs often leave something to desire, even
without comparing them to pictures for;
                                             it
                                             is     certain that they
are attended with grea'' difficulties, and we have not always oc
casion to remark, on viewing them, that the subject     is   well un
derstood from the bas-relief.       Their execution demands, there
fore, a peculiar sort of talent.
   After having overcome the difficulty of supporting the figure,
i. e. having found  a  method of doing so without making the ac
tion appear constrained or unnatural, sculpture   is  obliged to dis
cover a position which shall be happy in every respect       :    and
whoever has not reflected upon this difficulty, cannot conceive the
pains necessary to be taken to find an accurate and agreeable
adjustment of all the parts and for every point of view.          We'
                                                                ought

90                        An Attempt    to draw
ought not to forget that painting works under a single point of
view.
    The parts which are most isolated, and particularly the arms*
do not less embarrass the sculptor: he ought to have support
and solidity constantly in his mind; they are of such necessity
in execution, that in order to attain them, he is frequently com
pelled to renounce the most expressive attitudes.       How great is
the constraint therefore in composition!       What are the curtail
ments to which genius must not submit !
    The accessories concur to the action, and serve to make it
known ; their assistance is a very great resource to the arts :
eloquence even makes use of them, for an epithet appears to
me to be an accessory, or if we please an attribute: the painter's
only fear is lest he should abuse them ; whereas the sculptor,
restrained within very narrow bounds, can employ only attributes
often of very general application ; since they sometimes accord
with several figures, and since he can only place them on the
clothing, on the head, on the hands, and sometimes on the sup
port which has been mentioned.
   I do not speak of the convenience of positions, with respect to age
and character, nor of the correctness of the tracing, of the details
of putting the limbs and other organs in the right place, for these
parts are as necessary to sculpture as to painting: but the latter,
having only one front or one point of view to represent, is exe
cuted with the more facility, because, if the painter perceives
some error, or some degree of perfection which he can add, he
is master of the art of instantly effacing and retouching : the
sculptor, on the contrary, is deprived of this advantage; he can
not retrace his steps from the moment he has chipped off a
piece of marble.       I shall pass over in silence the constraints
which the dimensions of the block frequently occasion in pro
ducing the given figure. But these constraints are not all which
the art undergoes. The painter chooses the light which he wishes
to fall on a surface : the sculptor has no choice ; he has all
kinds of light at once, and this very abundance is to him a
source of embarrassment ; for he is obliged to consider and to
reflect on all the parts of his figure, and to work them accord
ingly: it is himself in fact who, as it were, gives the lights to his
subject.    A sculptor must also make several sketches until he
finds the proper attitude : in this respect the mind of the sculp
tor is more creative than that of the painter.      But this vanity is
not satisfied but at the expense of much reflection and fatigue;
whereas the painter has all the oppositions of colour, accidents
and effects of every kind at his command, to produce correspon
dence and harmony in parts which concur most to general har
mony, i. e. to the charms of sight.      The sculptor has no such
                                                          advantages.

advantages.         He has no guide but experience, and, if we may
so express ourselves, the fountain of his chisel, as the painter has
that of his penciL           The imitation of the human skin is the ob
ject and principle of the imitative arts: the flesh merits the
particular attention of both arts, since there is no part more pro
minent and with which the spectator is more struck: it ought to
be perceived chiefly over the muscles which it covers, without
 diminishing their play or size, and without altering their strength
 or position.        But how great are the differences in the method
 of expressing this skin ! Sculptors must search for examples in
 the clufs-d'oeiivre of the Greeks; they alone have given the
 model of profound knowledge and sublime execution : they must
 place all their confidence in the correctness and beauty of their
 works, and must not seek to surprise into admiration by a contrast
 in the positions.          It would  have   been  desirable if ancient au
 thors had made any mention of their method of studying.                It is
 evident, however, that it must have been different from that of
  the present day;        for even those among the moderns who have
  most copied and who have been most penetrated with admira
  tion of the Greek sculptors, have never caught their style nor
  method of working.             We merely know from the accounts of
  Pliny, that, far from neglecting the theory, they reflected deeply
  on their art.        The great number of artists whom he mentions
  as having written profoundly on this subject, does not admit of
   our refusing to believe this compliment.
       I return to the means which the painter possesses of giving
   expression to the skin.        It is easy for him to colour his work;
   and, without speaking of half-tints, to support it by large shades.
   He may easily enliven it by forcible touches which produce au
   agreeable opposition and a happy contrast with this same skin ;
   whereas the sculptor cannot produce the same effect without the
   greatest pains, and he does so without the aid of any of those
   chance-touches of the painter which resemble the sallies of the
   imagination in a Ion mot which reflection never could have fore
   seen.      When the studies of the painter are at an end, he may
   sit<by his fire and survey all the parts of his picture: he covers,
    extinguishes, revives, and harmonizes: the sculptor with a sharp
    chisel, which acts only when it is struck with a mallet*, and/
    without having it in his power to restore the substance which it
    has removed, cannot give harmony to his figure without the
    most laborious attention and the most accurate judgement, sub
    ject to the idea of a perfect whole, which he ought "to have con
    stantly present in his mind, without having it in his power to
        * All the fine works of sculpture are finished with the point  of  the

abandon it for a moment. From the hair of the head to the sole
of the foot, how many touches of the chisel does it not require
to render a piece of sculpture sublime !
    The two arts cannot pay too much attention to the subject
of draperies.     We might make a long dissertation on the abuses
in this department : but sculpture requires in this respect still
greater pains than painting.       Bernini, whose talents are un
questionable, has given much amplitude and flow to his draperies.
This novelty has been productive of bad consequences.         In or
der to avoid the difficulties of forming the naked figure, an ex
cess of drapery has been resorted to by the followers of Bernini :
they have forgotten that the clothing ought always to recall the
idea of the form of the parts under it ; latterly, in Italy as
well as in France, statues have been covered with a multiplicity
of large folds, and have exhibited motions which nature never
 dictated.   Thus stepping from abuse to abuse, the draperies have
been composed separately with great nicety, and frequently di
rectly against the natural effect of the weight and movement of
the figure which they are intended to clothe.      This is not asto
nishing, since they are intended to be fixed upon a lay-figure,
and adjusted at pleasure.      The ancients are still our masters hi
this respect: it was not through ignorance or idleness that they
made choice of light draperies, which have been erroneouslv de
nominated moulded draperies ; but the dresses which they re
presented being composed of gauze or muslin, preserved the
naked shape, and conveyed the idea of all tho movements of the
body in a manner so agreeable, that the eye was always satisfied,
and nature gained in some respects from voluptuousness.
    It is scarcely necessary to say that this proposition cannot be
general ; and that decency requiring a great degree of modesty,
the figures which belong to religion in particular cannot admit of
much nakedness.       But would it be impossible to dress them in
thinner clones, less ample, and less loaded with great folds ? As to
those which we borrow from fable, we have too many reasons for
following the examples which the ancients have given us.
    It cannot be said in favour of the sculptor that he has the ad
vantage of moulding the parts. Without entering into a detail by
which painting may equally profit, it would result from tin's
operation that all statues would be excellent, because there is
no part of the human body which cannot be moulded and copied
by the compass; nevertheless the contrary is too well demon
strated: in fact, not only does nature sometimes present imper
fections, but all the parts selected and moulded do not agree
with each other.      The joinings at least must be supplied: be
sides, the character of a moulded part is generally frigid, and does
not accord with the subject intended to be represented : and
                                                              lastly,

             a Parallelbetween Paintmg and Sculpture.                 93
lastly, the proportions are different.       It must be admitted, how
ever, that this facility of moulding has frequently been used by
ignorant sculptors ; but it will always be easy to distinguish the
use which they have made of it: nature breaks out, and the eye
is struck with it the moment it is perceived.         Thus we may say
in general, that by supposing an equal degree of mediocrity, the
sculptor with the aid of the mould will appear superior to the
painter, when both of them work without genius.
     It has been generally thought that real colours applied to a
work of sculpture      ought to produce the most perfect imitation.
This practice, adopted in the barbarous times of antiquity, was
preserved throughout Europe until the revival of the arts. We
find even at this moment in country towns statues of saints
plastered over with various colours.         The grosser senses of the
peasantry    are struck  with  this alliance of sculpture and painting ;
but it is the only beauty they have : for I can safely assert, that
if Apelles and Lysippus could have joined their talents upon one
and the same statue, they would not have produced any tiling
agreeable or satisfactory : the two arts which these great men
 have illustrated, lose equally their advantages by uniting their
efforts; and nothing so forcibly proves their real difference, as
 the productions which arise from their copartnership.
     Colours when placed on a statue present no shading : the
 details of the figure become fixed and immoveable; and although,
 physically speaking, they cannot be otherwise, the pencil and the
 chisel produce illusions, giving rise to ideas of the motion which
 suits the parts, and present several details of the passions which
 they have seized and taken, as it were, on the wing.
     The examination of a drapery will serve as a term of com
 parison, and may give an idea of the way in which this opera
 tion of colouring destroys the fine and delicate expression of the
 passions.
     I shall suppose this drapery to be loose and flowing. The
 painter will give to his picture either its lightness, the strength
 of the wind, or that of the action.          The drapery of the same
 kind will be represented by sculpture much less extended, but
 it will be sufficient if it seems to float in the air. From the mo
  ment that it is coated with paint it will become heavy; its
  folds, which are very fine in mere sculpture, will appear loaded.
  The contour, deprived of the effect of opposition, such as the
  painter gives it at pleasure in a picture, will become heavier, as
  well as all the details of the mass: the salient parts treated' by
  sculpture can produce only harsh and crude effects; for colouring
  cannot suit all the aspects of a lay-figure, and the work will
  necessarily be deprived of every kind of harmony: thenceforward,
                                                                       in

94              New Outlines       of Chemical Philosophy.
in short, it can only be regarded as an assemblage ef masse?,
without any general or particular connexion?.
    Thus, each of these arts, residing within bounds prescribed
by nature, ought to keep to its advantages, and surmount its de
fects by touches mutually borrowed.            Painting, notwithstanding
the grandeur and abundance of its means, always endeavours to
produce the effect of reliefs, and thus to imitate sculpture. The
latter, confined to solid matter, cannot be susceptible of har
mony and opposition, except from the variety of the workman
ship of the chisel, and by the more or less of decision in the
shading : it cannot draw this harmony from any thing but from
itself, or, what is absolutely the same, from the mere colour of
the matter upon which it works: in order to please, it seeks the
harmony of painting : — both arts, therefore, mutually lend each
other assistance.      In this case they are sisters; but they are dif
ferent in their methods of attaining the same end, and they can
not reside under the same roof.
    It results from these reflections, founded on the essence and
the detail of the two arts, that the sculptor, having less assist
ance, seems to have more merit when he arrests and astonishes
the spectator, to make him feel all the grandeur of a great ac
tion : but at the same time the spectator requires a great variety
of lights to judge by; and consequently painting, being more
adapted to the capacity of all men, and flattering their idleness
more, must necessarily have more friends and a greater number
of partisans.

resolvable into two principles ; one that of oxygen, the base of

than water, hydrogen, or that whieh with the addition of ca-

how can we doubt of       it,when we see that, in burning together

obtain exactly an hundred grains of water, in which,        by

these able and experienced chemists," says Dr. Priestley, " must I

would appear to consist         of

it may be proved to consist of oxygen only.        For when steam
is sent over this substance in a red heat, nothing but the purest
fixed air is produced ; and yet the whole of any quantity of wa
ter may be expended in that production.         As water is not said
to contain any carbon,    this must  be  supplied by the terra pon-
derosa, and all the oxygen by the water.        For according to the
theory fixed air consists of 2S partsof carbon, and 72 of oxygen.

out some product in which the other may be supposed to enter."
    The French . chemists have introduced innumerable errors into
science, by drawing false conclusions from their experiments.
When they saw that, in burning together 15 grains of in
flammable air, and 85 of vital air, they obtained exactly 100
grains of water, they concluded that water is a compound of
those two gases.       But light and heat were produced in their ex
periment,    as well  as water: but these phaenomena escaped their
notice ; and this oversight might lead them to form an erroneous
hypothesis.     Since nothing that is inflammable can be procured
from pure water by any means yet discovered, it follows of
course that the elements of combustion must first be put into
water before those two gases can be obtained, which are sup
posed to be its component parts.
    Now, when a Leyden phial is discharged through the air,
light and heat are produced ; but when it is discharged through
water, two gases are formed by taking up a portion of           it,
                                                               which,
by a    certain modification,     constitutes their ponderable basis.

 them and in a charged Levden phial being the same, the effects
 in both cases are produced by the same cause.
    From these incontestable facts        appears, that the authors of
                                            it
 the new theory mistook the formation and decomposition of the
 two gases, for the decomposition and recomposition of water.
 And as this false hypothesis has gained so much ground in Eng
 land as to be received as       achemical axiom, every correct ex
 periment ought      therefore to  be brought forward, that tends to
 refute  an erroneous opinion which retards the progress of true
 science,

                                To    Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, — - The    practice of navigation by the rotary movement
of wheels having excited the attention of public authorities, as
well as of private individuals, perhaps you will allow the fol
lowing suggestions to be made known to the readers of your
Magazine.
   Vol. 47. No. 214. Feb. IS16.                        G               Ut

                         On Wafer- Wheels
    Let it be supposed     that the axle of a wheel is furnished with
six equidistant planes projecting from the axis, at right angles
to the line of its direction, in the form of a common water-wheel.
If the axle be made to rest upon the surface of stagnant water,
and the wheel be made to revolve quickly through the fluid ; the
water, which is displaced by the lower planes, will be replaced
by the contiguous particles of water from the front, from below,
and from either side.       Three of the planes will pass through
the fluid at the same time, and the motion of the wheel will be
much more resisted than if each of the planes could be made to
pass singly through the fluid at separate times.          But, of the
three planes passing through the fluid at the same time, the one
which has just entered the water, and the other which is just
going to emerge from the water, have both together very little
tendency to impel the axle along the surface ; their waste of
power more than counterbalances their efficient power.
    Let a wheel have its axis in the diameter of a hollow cylinder,
and be made to revolve through water at the depth of the axle ;
the water, extruded by the planes, can only be replaced through
the front passage : there can be no lateral currents ; the water
in front will be lowered by being drawn into the cylinder by the
moving planes, and the water behind will be raised by the quan
tities forced out in that direction ; both of which effects will
tend to cause a movement of the machine along the surface of
the sustaining water.       In this state of a wheel, any number of
planes will scarcely augment the resistance to motion, for the
water will be driven through the cylinder by the advanced plane
with the velocity of that plane; and the current which follows,
will be caused by the lateral pressure of the fluid onlv : therefore
the retired planes will find the requisite velocity already com
municated to the water with which they first come in contact,
and will move in concert with the stream, unresisted in any
perceptible degree, till they, successively being brought in ad
vance, will exercise alternately a similar function, of acting by
a separate impulse against the resisting fluid.      Under these cir
cumstances, the resistance to motion will be the pressure of
water upon the area of a single plane.          The horizontal per
cussion of a descending plane against the surface oPthe fluid
will be imperceptible, and exempt from all those inconveniences
which would result from the same act of a wheel moving in free
water.
    Again, let three parts of a case be strongly connected to
gether, namely, a flat bottom and two sides, and let the axle
of a wheel be supported in the sides so as to revolve clear of
the bottom.      Let the top of the case be a curved plate drawn

round the perimeter of the wheel, about twenty-five degrees be
low the axle : two parallel openings will then remain at the
lower part of the case, equal in depth to one-third the diameter
of the wheel.        Let each plane he one-third the diameter in
depth, which size will leave the central part of the wheel to re
tain a considerable open space, according to the present general
structure of steam-boat wheels.         Let the machinery, thus formed,
be lowered into water till the wheel becomes wholly covered with
the fluid ; and in that state, through a tube which has been pre
pared for the occasion, let air be forced into the machine till
the water becomes depressed twenty-five degrees below the axle,
when it will just meet the top of the lowest plane*. If the wheel
be then made to revolve, the water will be drawn and extruded
through the parallel openings at the bottom of the case, and
the machine will be moved from its position by the resistance of
the fluid to the acting planes.         The condensed air by its speci
fic levity will always occupy the upper sections of the case,
and by its elastic pressure will keep down the inclosed water
very nearlyJo one determined horizontal level.           Passing through
the open space round the axle, the air by its fluent and springy
 properties will continue to arrange itself in the upper sections,
 conformably to any motion of the wheel, and in such a manner
 that its elastic pressure shall act almost, equally on either surface
of the upper planes, without producing a sensible obstruction to
 their movement.
     The machinery can easily be applied to any part of a boat or .
 vessel ; but it is calculated to ascertain if a central station can
 be practically occupied by a wheel.
     To prevent the escape of the condensed air through the groove
 in which the working end of the axle revolves, one method shall
 be described.      Let a box, two feet long and two inches deep,
 by means of circular holes in the sides, be forced upon the end
 of the axle at the exterior of the machine, to which it must be
 closely attached.       Let the box be nearly filled with water or oil,
 and let the condensed air, from the interior of the machine, be
 admitted through a fixed communicating               tube,* into the box
 above the fluid.      The air, which endeavours to escape round the
 axle by its own elastic power, will then be resisted by the same
 power acting upon the fluid in the external box, and by the ad
 ditional weight of the fluid also: therefore the air can never
 escape in that direction, unless the more dense fluid be first ex-
     * Our  correspondent is probably not aware that the idea of inclosing
  the  wlieel in an air-tight case, and depressing the surface of the water
  by means of injected air, was some years ago embraced in a patent ob
  tained by Mr. Trevcthick alone, or in conjunction with Mr. Dickinson.

pelled from the circumference of the axle which is surrounded
by it in the box.      Any requisite supplies of water or of oil can
be furnished to the box by a variety of simple means ; and thus
the axle may be allowed to revolve in circles, whose concave
perimeters will not even embrace it water-tight, and yet pre
serve the air securely from escaping.
    The centre of a vessel is that part which is least affected by
any agitation of the elements ; and it may, perhaps, be practica
ble to assign a central position to the wheel ; and if that assign
ment of place be practicable, the wheel may be made to act effi
ciently when the whole circumference revolves at any depth be
low the external surface of the water through which the vessel
moves.     An inclosed wheel may be comparatively smr.ll in dia
meter, because the descending planes strike the water horizon
tally without any obstruction to their progress ; a waste of
power will be saved, because the resistance to motion will be the
pressure of water upon the area only of a single plane ; and
the exterior case will be an important protection to the wheels.
   As an act of amusement, a strong box had its top and both
ends removed, and was fastened by iron bars to the stern of a
heavy row-boat at sea ; a wheel was placed upon the sides of
the box with its axle touching the water, and then made to re
volve by pressing with the right and left hand alternately upon
the perimeter.     The boat was impelled half a mile through the
waves ; but the power was badly placed, and likewise too small
to give any velocity to the wheel.         The stern is the very worst
position   for a  wheel  ;  the  water  at  the stern of the boat is
lowered by the moving planes, and much efficient pressure is
destroyed by the act.

Sir, —    JL o the questions put to me by a correspondent, at
p. J 2 of your last Magazine, on the subject of the different re
positories of coal in the NE part of England, I shall reply with
as much brevity as the subject will admit, and hope my answers
may be found satisfactory.
   To query 1 . — Mines of coal and quarries of encrinal limestone
are worked at short intervals from the sea-coast of Northumber
land N of the Coquet in a direct line to Alston Moor ; but the

valuable seams found in the low country have basseted out be
 fore the mountainous district is reached. The thin beds of crow
coal are subordinate seams in the same formation.
    2. — The overlying masses and beds of basalt situated in the
NE of Northumberland resemble those of the King's Park at
 Edinburgh, in miniature ; whereas the great whin sill of the
 lead-mine country appears to be a wedge-shaped bed of basalt
thickening towards the SW, and separating the mere regular
strata in the same manner as the toadstone of Derbyshire.
    3. — Clay, ironstone and shale comprising muscle shells are
met with from the shore at Holy Island to the banks of North
and South Tyne, and in the Newcastle coal-field from the rocks
at the mouth of Shields Harbour to Wylam Colliery. — See the
 Map of Northumberland.
    4. — The calcareous red and white sandstones, shales and gyp-
sum, over which the Tees flows from the vicinity of Croft to
the sea, and which I conjecture is the red marl formation of some
south country geologists, was proved to comprise thin seams of
bad coal on the Dinsdale estate, by borings made in 1/89; and
for the fact I beg leave to refer to the sections in the port folio
of the Geological Society. — This set of strata certainly rests-
upon the magnesian limestone, and is covered by the alum shale
rock.
    5.— The specimens of coal which were presented me by a
gentleman who collected them on the Lincolnshire coast are
black as jet, though resembling brown coal in structure.       Iam
aware that the bituminous shale situated immediately below the
hard chalk, and out of which clunch these fragments of coal are
conjectured   to have been washed, does, not occur on the surface
at Louth;— yet I cannot think the coal worked at Easingwold
should be referred to the same repository; but, from the am
monites and other marine exuviae there detected, should rathei
refer it to the thin coal-formation which lies upon the alum-
rock, and is covered by the oolite limestone in the neighbourhood
of York, &c. particularly the dip of the Whitby formation being
towards the South West.
   Should this supposition be erroneous, I hope your correspon
dent will take the trouble to set me right,

  XXII.    On the Depression of Mercury in the Tule of a             Ba
    rometer, depending on its capillary ^Action.             By M.   La
    place*.
 It  is necessary to determine the magnitude of this depression
 in order to render barometers comparable with each other. For
 this purpose we find, in the Philosophical Transactions for 1776,
 a table of corrections formed from experiment by Lord Charles
 Cavendish.     At this period the theory of capillary action was
 unknown [?]: but this theory having been since discovered,
 and reduced to the fundamental principle of chemical affinities,
 that of a mutual action of the molecules of matter, decreasing
 with extreme rapidity, so as to become insensible at the smallest
 perceptible distances, it becomes proper to derive from this
 principle the table of the depression of mercury, and to borrow
 from observation only the necessary elements, as is usual in
 astronomy.     In this manner we have the advantage of obtaining
 those elements with all' possible precision, by comparing the
 whole of the phenomena depending on them with the results of
 theory; and we avoid the small irregularities which the errors
 of observations introduce into a table formed from experiment
 only. In this case, the elements required are the angle which
 the surface of the mercury makes with the side of the tube with
which it is in contact, and the depression of the mercury below
the general level, in a very narrow tube of glass.           The more pr
less perfect dryness of the tubes may affect these elements. We
know that their interior surface is lined with a stratum of water
which it is very difficult to remove. It is within this stratum
that the mercury of the Barometer rises and falls: its thickness
is sufficient to render the action of the glass on the mercury in
sensible ; and the depression of this liquid in the barometer is
determined by the reciprocal action of water and mercury. The
boiling of the mercury in the tube diminishes more and more
the thickness of the aqueous covering ; but it appears that in
the best barometers it still remains sufficient to render the action
of the glass insensible.    We find in the excellent siphon baro
meter of the observatory, that the convexity of the drop which
terminates the two columns of the liquid, is not sensibly different
in the two branches ; and I have concluded from the experi
ments of M. Gay-Lussac, that this convexity is the same that
takes place in a tube of glass completely moistened, provided
that the water do not cover any part of the surface pf the drop ;
" for if the whole surface is covered, I have shown that this sur-

 face of the drop becomes less and less convex, then plane, and
 at last concave        ;and in this case the capillary phenomena

 ried so far and the action of the glass on the mercury not
              ;
 being sensible, whatever differences there may be in the materials
 of the glass, they have no influence of the capillary effects of
 the tubes. We will suppose then, agreeably to experiment, that
 the angle of contact of the surface of the mercury with the sides
 of the tube   is the same as in the open air.           This angle, and the
 depression   of the   mercury   in very    narrow  tubes,    are very difficult
 to determine by experiment            they may;     be   collected    from dif

     In order to form this table,           was necessary to integrate

   been divided into twelve equal parts, and the depression of the
  •mercury supposed successively equal to 4'5, 4, 3"5, 2, 1'5, and
    1 millimetre: then for each     tenth down to '1 and '05 milli
   metre.    The depression heing always inversely proportional to
   the radius of curvature at the vertex of the curve, the first radius
   was immediately known.        This radius gave the values of the
   absciss and ordinate corresponding to the first division, consi
   dering it as the arc of a circle, the absciss heing always taken
   upon the axis of the curve, beginning from its summit.        These
   first values, being substituted in the expression for the radius of
   curvature, gave the second radius, and by means of this the in
   crements of the absciss and ordinate in the second division were
  determined, considering the curve again in this part as a circular
   arc described with the second radius of curvature.     In this man
  ner the second values of the absciss and ordinate were obtained,
  by means of which a third radius of curvature was determined.
  Proceeding in the same manner to the last division, the last value
  of the ordinate becomes equal to the semidiameter of the tube
  corresponding to the supposed depression.      But for a depression
  below eight-tenths of a millimetre, the radii of curvature
  the vertex are so large,, that it was necessary to divide the i
  tent of the arc into smaller portions ; the calculation has there
  fore been made for every two decimal degrees, as far as 1 2 ; and
  for the first six degrees, by the assistance of converging series,
  which I have derived from the differential equation of the sur
  face of a liquid, when the greatest inclination is inconsiderable.
      The formulae and the series which have been employed for
  the first six decimal degrees are these.    Let V<r> be the inclina
  tion of the end of the curve at the lower extremity of the rth
  division ; let *(r) and w(r) be the absciss and ordinate corre
  sponding to the same extremity; let £<r) also be the radius of

being here represented by their logarithms, for          the assistance of
the calculation ; and the figures distinguished           by a horizontal
stroke being negative indices.       In this manner,      by assigning to
u such a value that V should be between four             and six decimal
degrees, the corresponding ordinate* have been very accurately
determined for this inclination of the end of the curve : hence,
by means of the preceding formulae, these ordinates have been
calculated for V = 6°, and this angle has been successively in
creased by two degrees at each step still it became 12u, and
then by four degrees as far as V = 52°.
    In order to arrange the results obtained by this method in a
table calculated for equal increments of the diameter of the tube,
I have observed that the differences of the logarithms of the de
pressions form in this case a series which varies but very slowly.
By means of this property, t have obtained without difficulty
the following table, the principal calculations having been
obligingly furnished me by Mr. Bouvard : and the same property
will also serve for the interpolation of the table.
   We find in Nicholson's Journal for October 1809, a similar
table, formed by the expansion of the expressions for z and
sin V into a series, and founded on elements differing but little
from those which we have employed.               These two tables agree
very nearly with each other, and with that which Lord Charles
Cavendish had deduced from experiments.                 But the method
which we have just explained appears to me to be more
accurate [??], and more convenient for calculation [??] ; it has
besides the advantage [??] of showing the influence of the varia
tion of the angle of contact of the surface of the mercury with
the tube on the capillary action.       It is well known that by the
friction of the mercury against the sides of the tube, and per
haps also by a peculiar viscosity of the liquid^ the angl? is liable
                                                                         to

to considerable variations: it diminishes sensibly when the ba
rometer rises, and increases when it descends, the surface of
the drop becoming more convex in the former case, and less
convex in the latter.     In order to restore the surface to its na
tural state, it is usual to strike the tube gently and repeatedly ;
but it is difficult to remove the irregularity altogether.       For
tunately  when   the tube  is very large, the variations of the angle
of contact have but little effect on the depression of the sum
mit, though they sensibly alter the height of the convex part.
The method above explained affords us the means of appreciat
ing this alteration.    For, the depression remaining the same, it
enables us to ascertain the addition made to the corresponding
ordinates of the section of the surface in the last division of its
length: and then, the angle of contact being supposed constant,
it gives us the variations of the extreme corresponding ordinates,
with reference to a given variation in the depression. It is easy
to infer from these determinations, by the methods of the dif
ferential calculus, the variations of the depression of the sum
mit of the drop, and of its height, depending on a given varia
tion of the angle of contact ; and consequently the variation of
the depression corresponding to an observed variation of the
height of the drep.     I find in this manner, that in a tube 11 '4
millimetres in diameter, a diminution of one-tenth of a milli
metre, in the height of the convex portion, produces in the de
pression depending on capillary actjon a diminution of "015
that  is, about one-seventh as much as the diminution of the
                                                                             f

XXIII.       On Meteorological Nomenclature.                      By P. J. Brown,
                                           Esq.
                                  To    Mr.    Tilloch.
SrR,      — Want   of leisure has  prevented my perusing, till this
evening, Mr. Forster's paper      on the nomenclature of clouds
published in your last number,     and I regret being compelled to
differ in opinion from a person   for whose talents I have so much
respect.   In every department of polite literature, with the ex
ception of scientific nomenclature, I feel decidedly hostile to the
late fashionable introduction of exotic words*: the writings of
Swift, whose language must be admired by every lover of pure
English, have fully proved the adequacy of our mother tongue,
for every purpose of general composition : but it should be re
collected, in adopting scientific terms, that science is not a na
tive of any particular country; but a citizen of the world who
will always be protected and fostered in every state alive to its
own interest and glory: it is consequently evident that the lan
guage of science should be, to as great an extent as can be ac
complished, intelligible to all.
   Consider the state of chemical knowledge when the illustrious
Lavoisier composed his excellent nomenclature:       can it be sup
posed that the acquisition     of that most pleasing and useful
science would have become so general,          instead of adopting
                                                          if,

terms easy to he comprehended by all persons of moderate edu
 cation, he had rummaged the old neglected Norman-French for
 a set of uncouth epithets which would have posed an antiquary P
 Suppose that the still more illustrious Linnaeus, instead of his most
 admirable, comprehensive, and comprehensive terms, had pub
 lished his Systema Nutmte, his Genera and Species Vlantarum,
 with a scientific nomenclature extracted from the barbarous ra
 dicals of the Swedish language, can it be for a moment thought
 that the study of nature, and consequent expansion of the hu
 man mind, would have been so universal as it happily has been ?
     In illustration, let us consider the languages of botany and
 mineralogy: a person possessing no more knowledge of the
 learned languages than is necessary for the proper comprehending
 of our own, without being able to translate a single line of Virgil
 or Horace, may (from the universal adoption of the Linnaeaii
 phraseology) in a very short time be able to take up the Flora
 of almost any country, and stroll with its author through paths
 of flowers ; now investigating the scanty herbage of the northern,
 regions, and then revelling in the magnificent productions of
 New Holland or the Cape.           Mineralogy on the contrary, whose
 connexion with chemistry, whose durable productions abounding
 with beauty, brilliancy, and the most correct geometry, would,
 under more favourable circumstances, have been studied with
 delight, is comparatively neglected ; and may not the neglect
 be in a great measure attributed to the jargon with which it is
 incumbered ? a jargon unintelligible to any but the Germans,
 from whom it sprung, and the few who have degraded themselves
by their conversion into Germanised Englishmen ! Had the state
 of chemical and mineralogical knowledge been the same in the
 time of Linnaeus as it is at present, he would mast probably have
 occasioned the extensive cultivation of the latter, by bestowing
 on it a language brilliant and exact as its own native crystals;
 whereas the student is now enveloped in a fog, dark and im
penetrable as the recesses from whence those crystals are de
rived.
     If Mr. Forster's meteorological observations were intended
for the information of his countrymen only, and were made known
to them through a medium the circulation of which was con
fined to the limits of our own isle, there could be no objection
to his conveying instruction in the terms he proposes ; but when
it is recollected that your valuable Magazine most deservedly
attracts the attention of those citizens of the scientific common
wealth who reside abroad *j I should hope that, on reconsidering
      '                                                                the

    P. S. — The snapping of sulphur when held in the warm hand,
as noticed by your correspondent J. F., is a property which has
long- been     known: it is mentioned by several authors to whose
works I have not the opportunity of immediate reference; but
I can venture from memory to refer to the lesson on Sul->
phur in Lagrange's Manual of Chemistry : for J. F's ingenious
observations     on the subject he has full credit.
with those inserted in your Magazine: and with respect to the difficulty of
impressing on the minds of mere English readers, names derived from the
Latin, it is presumed that the term cumulus will as readily convey the idea
of a heaping up, or accumulation (ad cumulus) of clouds, as the proposed
•ne of stackenclaud : indeed, if new terms must he acqaired, the trifling
additional diificulty (should any exist) will be no impediment to those sti
mulated by a desire to learn.
    t  As many of your young readers who are pleased with the study of
 mineralogy may not have entered into its investigations five years ago,      I
 shall consider no apology necessary for recommending to their perusal
Mr. Chenevix's " Reflections on some Mineralogical Systems," published
 in your xxxvith and following volumes. In volume xxxvith, and last para
graph of page 379,      I would suggest a manuscript reference to be made to
vol. xlii. page 25, where Professor Stromeyer's Observations on the Com
position of Arragonite will add force to Mr. C.'s arguments; by removing
 the only objection of any weight which remained opposed to the system
of M. Haiiy. Newton incurred the ridicule of the pseudo-philosophers of
 his day, by arguing from theory, that diamond ought to be inflammable,
 and that water itself should also contain much inflammable matter. Those
 whose ridicule he experienced had long rested in their graves, when the
 brilliant discoveries of modern chemistry proved the correctness of his
 assertion.   Can M. Haiiy's principles need a more honourable comparison ?
 They pointed out to him that arragonite ought to differ from carbonate of
 lime; the most celebrated chemists of the early part of the 19th century
 were long unable to detect the difference ; it is at length discovered, to the
 immortal honour of the French philosopher, and I trust to the sad discom
 fiture of the partisans of external characters and mineralogical instinct.

 XXIV. On      the Cosmogony    of Moses; in Answer to the Stric
       tures   of F. E       s*. By J. C. Prichard, Esq.
                            To    Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —   I   feel it incumbent upon me to reply to some stric
  tures contributed by a correspondent to the last number of your
  Magazine, on a paper of mine which you did me the honour of
  inserting in the Philosophical Magazine for October, and which
  contained an attempt to illustrate the wonderful and striking
  conformity that exists between the series of events recorded in
 the beginning of Genesis, and the result of geological researches
 into the crust of our globe.
     The question turns upon the sense we ought to affix to the
 words interpreted the " days" of the creation.          I have en
  deavoured to show that, if we receive the expression as desig
 nating indefinite periods of time, the whole account bears the
 most important relations to the epochs of nature.          I will add
 that, if we pay no regard to the genius of Hebrew literature, but
 are determined to interpret the writings of Moses according to
 the strictest rules which the idioms of our western languages
 impose, we shall distort the sense of many sublime passages ; and
 in this particular instance, in the place of a true detail of events,
 which we know to have really happened, shall substitute a rela
 tion improbable in itself, and wholly irreconcilable with the cer
 tain results of sensible evidence.
     But to proceed to the argument.      Your correspondent seems
                                    "
willing to allow that the word day" might properly bear the
sense I have affixed to     it,did    not occur in conjunction with
                                      it
the terms which designate the natural commencement and ter
mination of a day, viz. morning and evening.          Now, this cir
cumstance appears to me to occasion no difficulty whatever.
Nothing   is  more common than this mode of expression, even in
languages of so stiff and unbending a texture as the modern
European dialects.      If we use the word day to signify portion
                                                           a
of time, and have occasion to allude to the beginning or end of
the period designated, we always carry on the metaphor, and
adopt the corresponding terms. We continually hear such phrases
in rhetorical or poetical language as "the evening of our days,"
the "morning," "noontide" and              "
                                           evening
                                                   " of human

The poet Gray uses the very terms in dispute, when alluding in
one of his poems to the beginning and termination of Richard
the Second's reign.      He says      "
                                     Fair laughs the morn," &c. —

       gilded vessel goes," — " regardless of the sweeping whirl
n the
wind's sway," — " that hush'd in grim repose expects his evening
prey."     It will be said that this is the peculiar style of poetry:
but is it possible to doubt that the former part of Genesis is a
poetical composition?       Have not the first chapters all the man
ner and decoration of the sacred poetry of the East, — not indeed
of the poetry of fiction, but of the poetry of elevated feeling, and
of that style which sets forth great moral truths by means of
striking images in a manner fitted to produce their full impres
sion ? However, a parallel passage may easily be found in plain
English prose.       The following is from Sir Walter Raleigh :
"  The Devil is now more laborious than ever, the long day of
mankind drawing towards an evening." I doubt not that I
could find a hundred such examples if I had leisure to look for
them.
   Perhaps it may be thought more important in the present
case to remark, that in the most ancient books of the Oriental
nations which remain to our times, excepting only the writings
of Moses, the metaphorical use of the word day is very com
mon; and, what is more to our purpose, the words which desig
nate the natural terminations and divisions of a day, as night or
evening, and twilight or morning, are accurately specified, the
metaphorical sense being still carried on.      But before I proceed
to adduce examples of this kind, I must obviate an objection
that will immediately be made to any reference to such sources
in the present question.      It will be asked, What relation can
the books of other Eastern nations have to the Hebrew Scrip
tures, which are the productions of inspired writers ? To this
I answer, that the Oriental nations have exhibited from very re
mote times a general resemblance, a common character in their
modes of thinking and acting ; that the same conformity may be
expected, and really exists, in their manner of expressing their
thoughts, and in the style of their compositions ; and therefore
that the writings preserved by one of these nations from distant
ages may afford illustration with respect to the use of language
among the others.       But further, I am persuaded that some of
the compositions I refer to, have a much nearer connexion with
the early writings of the Hebrews than is universally appre
hended.
   Many biblical scholars have held the opinion that the early
part of Genesis consists of records preserved from periods of
very remote antiquity, and adopted by Moses as furnishing an
authentic sketch of the principal events which had happened in
the world down to the time of Abraham, when the particular
history of the Hebrews begins, and immediately assumes the
                                                             character

   112                  On the Cosmogony   of MoseS.
   character of a contemporary and circumstantial narrative;           I
   confess that this opinion seems to me to be supported by several
   strong arguments : but in maintaining it I do not place the au
  thor of the Pentateuch in the rank of common compilers of
  historical fragments possessed merely of natural intelligence; nor
  do I apprehend that the authority of the records themselves can
  be diminished by assigning them to an age as near as possible
  to the events recorded: neither do I regard them in their origin
  as common historical testimonies.         The cosmogony cannot be
  a piece of common history resting on human testimony.               It
  must certainly be either a fragment of the imagination, or a
  production which owed its origin to some supernatural intelli
  gence; and that it is not a mere figment, I am convinced by the
  accuracy with which it details the succession of the epochs of
 nature.
      The only argument which I shall notice in proof of the opinion
  above mentioned, is the great diversity of style which has been
  traced in various portions of the ante-Hebraic history, and the
 solution which this hypothesis affords of a phaenomenon which
 is wholly inexplicable on any other ; viz. the remarkable con
 nexion discovered between the primitive histories of the most
 remote nations on the earth, and these documents embodied in
 the Genesis.       The facts I allude to are to be found in many
 authors, and I need not detail them here; though, as it will pre
 sently appear, they bear a near relation to the subject of this pa
 per.     It is in vain to attempt to account for this coincidence,
 in the manuer which some of the Fathers and Hyde and Prideaux
have pursued, as by converting Abraham into Brahma; or by
making Zoroaster a renegado Jew ; since not only the Asiatic
nations, but the Runic scalds of Iceland and Scandinavia, and the
ancient priests of Mexico, were equally in possession of the pri
mitive traditions ; and the latter certainly never obtained them
from Jerusalem.
     These phaenomena can only be solved by going back to the
first periods of human society.        There are many circumstances
which indicate that certain records were preserved from ante
diluvian times.       That alphabetic characters were known before
the deluge,      is not  very probable ; but that hieroglyphic or per
haps picture writing was practised, does not seem inadmissible,
when we consider that these arts are found among nations in a.
very rude state of society, as the Canadians and South American
Indians.       It may reasonably be supposed that the true interpre
tation of such memorials was preserved among some nations,
and lost or diversified among others ; nor is it to be doubted
that the Hebrews retained the genuine sense, as they also pre
                                                                served

                      On the Cosmogony       of Moses.                113
served in purity the primitive religion.          We may thus account
for the different representations which we often find of the same
historical facts or moral truths.
    We have, moreover, direct historical testimony of the existence
of antediluvian records. Many ancient authors, particularly
St. Jude and Josephus, allude to writings which were attributed
to the patria'rch Enoch : and though I am not disposed to ad
vocate the authenticity of any such productions, yet the frequent
mention of them proves that the Hebrews were persuaded that
some writings had survived the flood.               But Berosus, whose
Chaldean history of the ten antediluvian generations differs but
little from that of Moses, expressly affirms that Xisuthrus or
Noah, after the intimation given him of the catastrophe that
was approaching, diligently compiled records of the former his
tory of the world, from which all existing accounts are said to
have been derived.
    We are thus enabled to account for the fact that scarcely any
thing is contained in the antediluvian history of Moses, which
 may not also be found, though more or less embellished, in the
records of other' nations, particularly in those of the Hindoos.
 Thus in the Institutes of Menu, as translated by Sir W. Jones,
 there are some passages relating to the epochs of the creation;
 and it is chiefly for the sake of quoting these that I have made
 so long a digression.
    That Menu or Satyavraeta was Noah, is certain from the ac
 count of his escape from an universal deluge, which agrees in
 general with that of Moses, containing also some of the fabulous
 circumstances mentioned by Berosus.            For the Hindoo story I
 refer your readers to the extracts given in several parts of Sir
 W. Jones's works ; and need only quote the following words, in
 which Vishnu is said to have foretold the approaching cata
 strophe.    " In seven davs all creatures which have offended me
 shall be destroyed by a deluge ; but thou shall be secured in a
 capacious vessel miraculouslv formed : take, therefore, all kinds
 of medicinal herbs and esculent grain for food; and together
 with the seven holy men, your wives, and pairs of all animals,
 enter the ark without fear*," &c.
    The Institutes of Menu begin with an account of the creation,
 which bears a strong resemblance to that of Moses, though em
 bellished or deformed by many wild conceits.          The spirit of God
 moving   on  the face of  the  waters  is expressed  in the same terms.
 Menu afterwards proceeds to       define  the periods which are termed
 days and nights.      He says, " Learn now the duration of a day
 and night of Brahma and of the several ages," Sec. — " Sages
                     * Translated from the first Purana.

Brahma may be known : his night has also an equal duration."
'— " At the close of his night, having long reposed, he awakes,
and awaking exerts intellect." — " Intellect, called into action by

 {Institut. Menu, by Sir W. Jones, chap. 1.)
     The relation of this account to the Mosaic cosmogony, and
to the particular object for which 1 have been induced to cite it,
 appears to me so obvious, that I cannot help thinking it will be
considered by every unprejudiced person as affording a strong
 confirmation to the interpretation 1 have endeavoured to main
tain, especially if it be allowed that Moses founded his narrative
 on an antediluvian record, and that another similar relic fur
nished the basis of the Hindoo legend ; for it cannot be imagined
 that the story, as it now stands, was the work of Menu or Noah.
 The application of the words twilight and night is to be parti
 cularly remarked.
     I shall not attempt to trace the record of the cosmogony
 among the different nations who preserved vestiges of it, but
shall content myself with adducing one more example : it is found
 in the scanty relics of the literature of the Etruscans, a peo
 ple whose early history is lost in the dark night of antiquity.
 Suidas* informs us that there was a verv ancient Etruscan his
torian of great authority, in whose works was found an account
 of the creation of the world, which he said was divided by the
 Creator into six departments, each occupying the space of a
 thousand years.     In the course of the -first chiliad or millennium
 he created the heaven and earth ; in the second, the visible
 firmament ; in the third, the waters of the ocean and those con
 tained in the earth ; in the fourth, the great luminaries of heaven ;
in the fifth, vegetables, and all kinds of animals; and in the
sixth and last, man.        The same remark which I made above
 on the Hindoo legend may be applied still more forcibly to this
 account preserved by the Etruscans.
     From these considerations I think we may conclude it to be
 highly probable, that the words of the first chapter of Genesis
 are to be interpreted in a tropical sense.        But, even if it should
 be made to appear that the words and phrases will not bear this
 construction, according to the natural forms of language, still I
 should by no means concede that we are to understand the
 cosmogony according to the vulgar acceptation ; and I should
 support this opinion on the following grounds.

     There are many parts of the ancient Hebrew Scriptures
which it is obviously necessary to understand, and which are
to be understood according to the judgement of the most learned
and orthodox critics, in a metaphorical manner ; not by mere
changes ill the force of particular words, but by figurative ap
plications of the sense of whole passages, the real meaning be
ing contained in some allusion, and expressed by a type, which
under a sensible and striking image conveys a more abstract
truth. It is well known that a similar method of illustration
prevailed extensively among the philosophers of the East, from
whom the Greeks learnt to divide their doctrines into esoteric
and exoteric, a practice which was introduced by Pythagoras
 and Plato, and followed by Aristotle and others.               We are well
 assured that the learned among the Jews viewed many parts of
 their ancient Scriptures in this light ; and, after the captivity of
their nation at Babylon, in which calamity a considerable portion
 of their literature was lost, and the explanations of many things
 apparently forgotten, which had been preserved among the
 priests, set themselves to make up the deficiency.              The extent
 of the Talmud, and the great authority which this compilation
 acquired, notwithstanding its numerous absurdities, proves how
 firmly they were persuaded of the esoteric sense contained in
 many parts of the biblical writings.         At the Christian aera there
 was only one sect, viz. the Sadducees, who wholly followed the
 literal meaning, and they were held in no great estimation : and
 we learn from St. Paul, that the Pharisees, who allowed the
 figurative sense, had the truest interpretation of the Jewish dis
 cipline.    It was in this path that Hillel acquired so much fame,
 as well as his descendant and follower Gamaliel.                Philo* the
 learned Jew, and Joseph us, assure us that many passages must
 be explained in this tropical or figurative way; and, what is
 very remarkable and strongly in favour of my argument, they
 both make an express observation to this effect, with reference
 to the six davs' work of the creation.         It cannot be denied that
 this mode of interpreting has led to many abuses, and that
 Origen and others, by explaining away the historical facts of the
 Old Testament into types and metaphors, converted history into
 a mass of mystical absurdity.        But this is no argument against
 the limited and judicious application of a method which is
 sanctioned, as we have seen, by the highest authorities among
  the Jews themselves and which has been acknowledged by all
 Christian writers to be necessary for the explanation of many
 passages.      Thus, for example, " what sense, except the most
  trifling one, can be made of the following passage, if we are
               * Philo Jitdgns in Cosmopaia item in Ailegoriis.
                                   H  2                              obliged

116                  On the Cosmogony      of Moses.
obliged to adhere to the obvious meaning of the words ? **,            I
will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between her
seed and thy seed ; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise
his heel."
    It being certain that we are to look for an esoteric sense in
some passages, there is none which more evidently requires such
an interpretation       than the cosmogonv.         Had Moses read a
lecture on geology to the shepherds of Goshen, and told them
what space of time each oceanic deposit occupied, and by what
organic remains it is to be recognised, he would have spent his
time to little purpose. His object, doubtless, was to declare that
the universe was the work of the Almighty Creator, and to set
this truth in a point of view the most striking and impressive.
At the same time, by mentioning a series of events which really
took place, in the exact order in which we are now assured that
they actually happened, he has left us a proof that he was not
uttering a rhapsody the mere offspring of his imagination.
    But if we are determined to adhere to the vulgar acceptation,
we shall, as I said before, establish a total and irreconcilable
schism between the Mosaic relation and the evidence of indu
bitable facts.
    No man who has witnessed the proofs to which geologv re
fers, and who is capable of putting two propositions together,
can refuse to admit this conclusion.        In traversing a mountainous
district  no  idea  forces itself more irresistibly on the mind, than
the vast periods of time which must have elapsed during the
gradual deposition and consolidation of the immense series of
beds whic.h constitute all the highest regions of the globe.      These
phaenomena attest indisputably an sera of incalculable extent be
fore the first efforts of living nature.        The second epoch, viz.
that of zoophvtes and vegetables, must have comprehended a
vast concourse of ages.          Pallas mentions a succession of lime
stone beds containing       encrinites  and other zoophytes, which lie
one upon another to the extent of 60 miles.               The whole of
Wales belongs to this aera ; for I have seen impressions of zoo
 phytes and testacea on the summit of Snowdon, which is the
 oldest part of the district, and the newest part is occupied by
 the coal-formation.        What a lapse of time must the successive
 deposition    of all  the  rocky beds which form this district have
occupied    !    Again,   if  we proceed from the centre of South
 Britain, in   a  direct  line towards Paris, we tread at every step
 from older to newer beds. We begin with the oldest beds, which
 belong to the third epoch, and contain the remains of fishes j
 and we reach the Paris basin before we discover the oldest ves
 tiges of quadrupeds ; and there we only find the bones of Valce-
 otheria and other P achy denies, which seem to have lived their

 earth became fitted for the reception of man, or              even of the
<juadrupeds which are subservient to his use, and which would
 seem to have immediately preceded his appearance, since we
find their relics only in alluvial grounds.
    With respect to the successive extinction of these races of ani
mals, it is a fact easily explained.          As the water of the ocean
became prepared for more perfect creatures, it maybe supposed
that it was unfit for sustaining those to which its former quali
ties had given birth. I have elsewhere endeavoured to show
that all land animals had originally a local and determinate seat
on the globe.       Confined by natural barriers within the limits of
their native regions, many of them seem to have awaited the
hour of their destruction by means of inundations and other ca
tastrophes.
    On the hypothesis proposed by your correspondent, I shall
only remark that, although purely conjectural, it is liable to an
objection drawn from physical considerations.                A number of
curious coincidences render it highly probable that the orbital
motions of the planets and their motions of rotation were pro
duced by the same physical cause, and were therefore simulta
neous in their commencement.              The circumstances I allude to
are set forth in a most luminous and striking manner by Laplace
 in his Sysleme de la, Nature.          But it is futile to enter into a
discussion of what may have happened before the creation of the
sun.
    Having thus fully stated the grounds of        the  opinion I formerly
ventured to offer,       I shall decline all further controversy    on this
 subject.

                              To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —     In  the month of November last I had the pleasure to
 communicate to you the result of several successful experiments,
 made in the presence of the Literary and Philosophical Society
 here, with the safe-lamp invented by Mr. Stephenson, which, I am
 happy to add, has been since used in the most dangerous parts of
 some coal-mines without any accident having occurred. On Tues
 day the 6th instant Sir H. Davy's recently improved lamp, the
flame of which is encompassed by wire-gauze, was also exhibited
                                   H  3                                  by

118                             On the Tides.
by a professional gentleman who had previously tried it in Walls
End and Hebburn collieries ; and its merits appear to be still
greater than those of Mr. Stephenson's.               The lamp being sus
pended in a vessel of glass open at the top, and the carburetted
hydrogen admitted from below, the bright flame of the wick
nearly disappeared, but the cylinder of wire-gauze was filled
with a feeble but steady greenish light.             On a greater volume
of inflammable air being thrown in, the flame gradually died out.
Results more satisfactory could not be expected nor wished for,
particularly when we were assured that these accorded with
numerous trials made in the most hazardous drifts of our coal
mines.
     Notwithstanding       all that has been lately said in some of the
periodical publications, respecting the obstinacy of the viewers
employed here, and the stupidity of their under agents and pit
men, you may depend upon it that these safe-lamps are hailed
by this class of people as a most fortunate discoverv, which will
soon be adopted by them in every mine infected with fire-damp.
And could a mode be struck out, of preventing inflammation tak
ing place by means of the furnace placed at the bottom of the up
cast shaft to accelerate the circulation of air through the work
ings, little would be wanting to render the occupation of the
collier as safe at least as that of the persons employed in lead
 and copper mines.

               XXVI.    On the Tides.       By M. Laplace*.
 [Read to    the first Class    of the Institute  the       of July 18'5.f]
 This      phaenomenon        particularly   merits the attention of ob
 servers, both because it is the            nearest and most perceptible
 effect of the action of the heavenly bodies, and because the nu
 merous varieties it presents are well calculated to verify the law
 of universal gravitation.          At the request of the Acadeinv of
 Sciences a course of observations were made at the beginning of
 the last century in the port of Brest, which were continued du
 ring six successive years, and of which the greater part have
 been published by Lalande in the fourth volume of his Astronomie.
 The situation of the port is very favourable for observations of
 this kind.      It communicates with the sea by means of a canal,
     * From   the Qonnoissance des Terns for 1818.
     t For this translation we are indebted to T. S. Evans, jun. of the Col
  lege school, Gloucester.
                                                                 terminating

                               On the Tides.                            119
 terminating in a very large road, at the extremity of which the
 port has been built.      Thus the irregularities of the motion of
 the sea are considerably weakened before they reach the port,
 very nearly in the same rjianner as the oscillations produced in
 the barometer by the irregular motion of a vessel, are diminished
 by a contraction in the tube of this instrument.            In other re
spects the tides being considerable at Brest, the casual varia
tions occasioned by winds form only a small part of them.                It
 may   also   be remarked   in  the  observations  made   of  these  tides,
however few there may be of them, that a great regularity pre
vails which is not altered by the little river, which loses itself
in the immense road of this port.          Struck with this regularity,
I solicited government to order a new course of observations to
be made at Brest, during an entire period of the motion of the.
nodes of the lunar orbit. They had long been wished for. These
new observations are dated from the 1st of June 1806, and since
that period they have been continued uniriTCrruptedly to this
day. There is still, however, much wanting. They relate
neither to the same part of the port, nor to the same scale. The
observations of the first five years have been made at the place
called La Mature, the others were taken near the bason.                    I
observe that this change has produced only slight differences;
but it would have been better, undoubtedly, if all the observations
had been made at the same place and upon the same scale.                 It
is time, indeed, that phenomena of this nature should be ob
served with the same care as those of astronomy.
    In these new observations 1 have considered those of the year
 1 807   and of the seven subsequent years.        In each equinox and
in each solstice I have chosen the three syzygies and. the three
quadratures nearest to this equinox and this solstice.              In the
syzygies    I  have taken the  excess of the  high water  of the  evening
above the low water of the morning of the day which precedes
the syzygy, of the day of the syzygy, and of the four following
days, because the highest tide happens about the middle of this
interval.      I have made a sum of these excesses corresponding
to each day, by doubling the excesses which relate to the inter
mediate syzygy, or that nearest to the equinox or the solstice.
By this means the effects produced by the variation of the di
stances of the sun and of the moon from the earth are destroyed ;
for if the moon were, for example, towards its perigeum in the
intermediate syzygy, it would be near its apogeum in the two
extreme syzygies.       The sums of the excesses thus obtained are,
 therefore, very nearly independent of the variations of the mo
 tion and of the distances of the heavenly bodies.             There are
 still inequalities of the tides, different from        that   inequality,
 whose period is about half a day, and which in our ports is
                                    H 4                              much

120                        On (he Tides.
much greater than. the others.      For by considering at the same
time the observations at the two equinoxes and at the two
solstices, the effect of the small inequality, whose period is
nearly a day, is mutually destroyed.        The sums in question
are consequently entirely owing to the great inequality.         The
winds can have little influence on them ; for, if they raise the high
water, they must equally depress the low water.        I have deter
mined the law of these sums for each year, by observing, that
their variation is very nearly proportional to the square of their
distance in time from the maximum which has given me this
maximum ; its distance at the mean of the times of the syzygy
tides, and the coefficient of the square of the times in the law
of the variation.   With regard to this coefficient, the little dif
ference which the observations of each year present, proves the
regularity pf these observations : and according to the laws
which I have eTse^Jiere established, on the probability of results
deduced from a great number of observations, some judgement
may be formed of the accuracy of results determined from th»
whole of the observations of eight years.
   In the same manner I have considered the quadrature tide?,
by taking the excess of the high water in the morning above the
low water of the evening of the day of the quadrature, ajid of
the three, following days. The increase of the tides, beginning-
from the minimum, being much more rapid than their decrease,
beginning from the maximum, 1 have thought it necessary to
confine the law of the variation proportional to the square of the
time Within a much shorter interval.
   In all these results the influence which the declinations of the
heavenly bodies have on the tides, and upon the law of their va
riation in the syzygies and in the quadratures, is evidently
shown. In consideringly the same method, eighteen equinoc
tial syzygy tides towards both the perigeum and the apogeum of
the moon, the influence which the changes of the lunar distance
have upon the height and upon the law of variation of the tides,
is manifested with the same degree of evidence.       It is thus that
by combining observations in such a way as to bring out every
element, which we are desirous of knowing, we are able to se
parate the laws of the phenomena when mixed and confounded
together in the collections of observations.
   After having obtained the results I have just mentioned, I
compared them with the theory of the tides delivered in the
fourth book of the Mecanique Celeste.       This theory is founded
on a principle of dynamics, which renders it very simple, and
independent of the local circumstances of the port, which cir-.
cumstances are too complicated for the possibility of submitting
them to calculation.      By means of this principle, they enter
                                                                 into

into the results of the analysis as arbitrary quantities, which ought
thus to represent the observations, if the universal gravitation is
in fact the true cause of the tides. The principle is this : The
 state (if
         a   system,  of bodies in which the primitive co?idilions of
motion have disappeared         bythe resistance  it  meets With,  is  pe
riodical, as well as the forces which animate it. By reuniting
 this principle to that of the coexistence of very small oscillations,
I   have obtained an expression for the height of the tides, of
  which the arbitrary quantities comprise the effect of the local
 circumstances of the port.       To deduce this, I     have reduced the
 generating expression    of  lunar  and   solar forces  acting upon the
 ocean into  a  series containing the sines and cosines of angles in
 creasing proportionally to the time.          Each term of the series
 may be considered as representing the action of another object,
 which moves uniformly at       a constant distance,          the plane of
 the equator.     Thence arise several kinds of partial tides, the
  periods of which are about half        lunar day,
                                         a             a day,  a month,
                                                                         is a
half-year, a year; and lastly, eighteen years and half, which
                                                           a
the duration of the periodical motion of the nodes of the lunar
orbit.
   In the book which       have quoted of the Mecanique Celeste,
                           I
I   have compared this theory with the observations made at
Brest at the commencement of the last century            and
                                                           ;    have
                                                                   1
determined the constant arbitrary quantities relative to this
port.  I    was curious to see whether these circumstances were
found to be the same       bythe observations made    century after
                                                           a
wards, or whether they have experienced any alteration             by
                                                                 the
changes which the operations of nature and art have produced,-
either at the bottom of the sea or in the port, and on the ad
jacent coasts. The result of this inquiry          ^that the actual
 heights of the tides, in the port of Brest, Surpass the heights
determined       by
                  the old observations       by
                                            about r'lth.   One part
of this difference may arise from the distance of the points where
 these observations were made; another part may be attributed
 to the errors of the observations: but these two causes do not
seem to me sufficient to produce the whole difference which in
 dicate with great probability     secular change in the action of
                                     a
 the sun and moon on the tides of Brest,          we could be well
                                                  if
 assured of the exactness of the graduations of the old scale, and
 taking into account its inclination to the horizon.     But the un
 certainty we are in with respect to this point, does not permit
 us to pronounce upon this change, which ought in future to
 fix the attention of observers.    In other respects the agreement
 is surprising  between  the  old and  the modern observations, as
 well as the theory   ;with regard to the variations of the heights
 pf  the tides depending on the declinations and distances of the

heavenly bodies from the earth, and the laws of their increase
and decrease in proportion as they recede from their maxi
mum and from their minimum.           In the Mecanique Celeste I
had not considered those laws relatively to the variations of the
distances of the moon from the earth.       Here I take them into
consideration, and I find the same agreement between the obser
vation and the theory.
    The retardation of the greatest and least tides which follow
the times of syzygies and quadratures, was observed by the an
cients themselves, as we read in Pliny the naturalist.       Daniel
Bemouilli, in his paper on the Tides, that gained the prize
proposed in 1740 by the Academy of Sciences, attributes
this retardation to the inertia of the water ; and perhaps also,
adds he, to the time taken by the action of the moon to trans
mit itself to the earth.    But 1 have proved in the fourth book
of the Mecamque CSleste, that by allowing for the inertia of
the water, the highest tides would coincide with the syzygies,
if the sea covered uniformly the whole surface of the earth. As
to the time of the transmission of the action of the moon, I have
discovered by a comparative view of the whole of the celestial
phaenomena, that the attraction of matter is transmitted with a
velocity incomparably greater than even the velocity of light
itself.  We must therefore seek some other cause for the retar
dation in question.     I have proved in the book quoted above,
that this c,ausc is the rapidityof the motion of the celestial body
in its orbit, combined with the local circumstances of the port.
I have remarked, moreover, that the same cause may increase
the ratio of the action of the moon on the sea to that of the
sun ; and I have given a method of determining this increase by
means of the observations, the idea of which is this : Let us
suppose the motion of the sun to be uniform : — if we consider
only the great inequality of the tides whose period is about half
a day, the solar tide is decomposed very nearly into two others,
which are exactly those that would be produced by two celestial
bodies moving uniformly, but with different velocities, in the
plane of the equator, at the mean distance of the sun from the
earth.    The mass of the first body is that of the sun, multiplied
by the cosine of the inclination of the ecliptic to the equator :
its motion is that of the sun in its orbit.  The second body con
stantlv corresponds with the spring equinox, and its mass is that
of the sun multiplied by the half of the square of the sine of
the obliquity of the ecliptic.    At the equinox these bodies are
either in conjunction or in opposition, and the tide i» the sum
of the tides produced by each of them: — at the solstice the bodies
are in quadrature, and the tide is the difference of these partial
tides.   The observations of the solar tide in these two points
                                                              show,

                              On (he Tides.                         123
show, therefore, the relation of the partial tides, and consequently
the ratio of the actions of the heavenly bodies on the ocean; and
by comparing it to the ratio of their masses, the increase pro
duced on it by the difference of their motion will be determined.
     This increase is almost insensible for the sun, on account of
the slowness of its motion ; but it is very evident for the moon,
whose motion is thirteen times more rapid, and whose action
on the sea is nearly three times greater.
     By comparing in the fourth book of the Mfcanique Celeste,
the observations of equinoctial and solstitial tides in the syzygies
and the quadratures, I was led by this method to an increase of
at least s tenth in the ratio of the action of the moon to that of
the sun ; but I remarked that an element so delicate ought to
be determined by a greater number of observations.             The col
lection of modern observations has procured me this advantage.
These observations, employed in double number, confirm the in
crease indicated by the ancient observations, and they make it
more than one-eighth. Another method founded on the com
 parison of the tides towards the apogeum and perigeum of the
 moon, and applied to the ancient as well as modern observations,
 leads us also to a similar result. — Thus the increase of the action
 of the heavenly bodies on the tides in the port of Brest ought
                                                                  *
 not to leave any doubt.
      The results of observations being always susceptible of errors,
 it is necessary to know the probability that those errors are con
 tained within given limits.      It is conceived, and with truth, that
 the probability remaining the same, those limits are the more
  diminished as the observations are more numerous, and agree
 better with each other.       But this general view of the subject
  is not sufficient to warrant the exactness of the results of obser
  vations and the existence of regular causes which they seem to
  point out.     Sometimes, indeed, it has induced us to seek for the
  cause of phenomena which were only the accidents of chance.
  The calculation     of probabilities  can alo,Jie enable us to appre
  ciate these objects, which renders its use of the highest import
   ance in physical and moral sciences.       The preceding researches
   afforded me an opportunity too favourable to be neglected, of
   applying the new formulae which I have obtained in my Tkeorie
   analytic/tie des ProlabilitZs, to one of the grandest phaenomena
   of nature.     I there explain at full length the application I have
   made of it to the laws of the tides.       My object has been, not
   only to confirm the truth of those laws, but to trace the way
   which must be pursued in applications of this kind. Among
   these - laws, the most delicate are those of the increase and de
   crease of the tides towards their maximum and their minimum,
    and the influence which the declinations      of the heavenlv bodies
                                                                        r

    124                        On the Tides.
   and the variation of their distances from the earth, exercise in
  this respect.    It is evident that these laws are determined by
  the observations with extreme precision and probability, which
  explains the remarkable agreement between the results of mo
  dern observations with those which the old observations had
  given me, and with the theory of gravitation.     According to this
  theory, the action of the moon on the sea follows the inverse
  ratio of the cube of its distance from the centre of the earth ; and
  this law represents the observations of the tides with such exact
  ness, that by these observations alone the law of attraction being
   reciprocally as the square of the distances might be determined.
      My principal desire was to apply my formulae of probability
  to the increase of the action of the moon on the tides, depend
  ing on local circumstances.      To determine this, the preceding
  observations have furnished me with sixteen equations of con
  dition, and from them I have determined this increase to be
  equal to the -poWir Pa, t of tne action of the moon on theocoan.
  By applying my formulae to this result, I find that there are
  21,400 chances to one, that the local circumstances of the port
  of Brest increase the ratio of the action of the moon on the
  tides to that of the sun: this increase may therefore be consi
  dered as certain; but there are only fourteen chances to one that
 the preceding value is not in error one half.       We must there
 fore wait for new observations to obtain it with great probabi
 lity of being mistaken by only very small quantities.
      The ratio of the actions of the moon and of the sun on the
 sea, corrected for the effect of local circumstances,    is very im
 portant    to  be known, because     it determines the  coefficients  ;
  1st, of the terrestrial nutation ; 2dly, of the inequality of the
 precession of the equinoxes ; and 3dly, of the lunar equation of
 the sun's motion.      Newton and Daniel Bernouilli had deduced
 this ratio from the phaenomena of the tides, but without having
 regard to the correction I have just spoken of, which they did
 not suspect.     The ratio which I have determined, and corrected
 by the whole of the preceding observations, gives the mass of
 the moon equal to l;fT; that of the earth being unity.               It
 therefore gives in sexagesimal seconds, 9'65" for the coeffi
 cient of the nutation ; which surpasses       the coefficient deter
 mined by the observations of Maskelyue only by -!-§-$- of a se
 cond.     My formulae of probability show that there are 21,400
 chances to one, that the nutation is not below 9-3 1", and there
 are the same number of chances to one, that it is not above
.9-94". According to this same ratio the coefficient of the in
 equality of the precession is 18-04j and that of the lunar equa
tion of the solar tables is 7-56", which differs from the co
efficient that M. Delambre found directly from the examination

of a great number of solar observations only by           r%-ff of a se
cond.     In this calculation, I have supposed the mean parallax
of the sun equal to 8-59", corresponding with that which I have
deduced from my theory of the moon, compared with the" in
equality of the lunar motion, known by the name of parallactic
inequality, and which M. Burckhardt has determined by means
of a very great number of observations. M. Ferere, a learned
Spanish astronomer, has lately confirmed this parallax by a new
investigation of the transit of Venus in 1769 ; in which, by his
own observations, he has corrected the latitude and longitude of
places where this transit has been observed in America.             The
agreement     between  all these   computations    determined   by phe
nomena so vague, is an additional confirmation of the principle
of universal gravitation.
XXVII. A       new Instrument      for   comparing    Linear Measures.
                         By M. de Phony*.
1    he comparison of linear measures, when great accuracy is
necessary, requires careful and delicate operations, as well as the
use of machinery not generally employed in commercial con
cerns, and difficult to be procured.          I have already published
the description of an instrument of this kind, invented and made
by M. Lenoir, member of the Board of Longitude, which is
as perfect as can be wished; but its expense and size put it
out of the power of common observers to procure, and render
it useless to travellers, who wish to know the proportion between
some given standard, and the linear measures of any country
through which they may pass.
   I have had made for my own use, a comparer, which joins
the two advantages of ceconomy and portability : all the pieces
of which it is composed may be fitted into a box of the size of a
quarto book.      The dearest part is a microscope; but even this
requires nothing different from those with which observers are
commonly furnished.         In general it is only necessary to be at
the expense of making three additional pieces, which I shall de
scribe presently.
    The properties and use of my comparer are founded on the
progress which the art of dividing a right line has made within
the last half ceutury.      This instrument has therefore, indepen
dently of the above advantages, that of requiring no vernier nor
micrometer screw, &c.
    It is well known that M. Richer, one of the first artists of
 Paris for the construction of mathematical instruments, ha«
                     * Comffi'jnicated l,y Dr. Evans.
                                                                    long

 126    A new,   Instrument for comparing Linear Measures.
long been in the habit of making divisions on glass that are very
clear and minute at the distances of iOOths of a millimeter, and
even less *.    A glass having two or three millimeters with the
division of one of them into 100 parts costs at his house, ten
or twelve francs.
    Some foreign artists have also succeeded in this kind of
work. I procured in my travels in Italy, two small discs of glass
on each of which are two millimeters, the one divided into ten
and the other into a hundred equal parts.                 I had them of
M. Capello of Turin, an artist who is equally celebrated for his
inventive mind and his ability to execute what he has con
ceived.
    I know also at Paris an amateur, M. Le Baillif, who applies
all the leisure moments which his situation under government
affords, to the cultivation of the sciences ; and who among his
other talents possesses that of dividing a right line on glass in a
rare and remarkable manner.          He has had the kindness to trace
for me on a small disc of glass 21 tenths of a millimeter; ten
of which are subdivided into lOOdths and 200dths.             These divi
sions of 200dths are very neat, and perfectly visible with a mi
croscope magnifying 100 times.
    Those persons who wish to possess a comparer like mine,
ought first to procure one of these glasses on which a right line
is divided into as many millimeters as they please, and one of
these millimeters subdivided into lOOdths.         The first 10, 20, 30,
 &c. strokes  of  this subdivision into 100, are prolonged, and the
5, 15, 25th, &e. should be also prolonged, but less than the
former, in order that the tenths and half-tenths of a millimeter
may be distinguished at Phe first glance of the eye.
    The piece of which I have just spoken must be fixed at one
of the extremities of a brass rule, the lengths of the strokes of
the divisions being perpendicular to the length of the rule which
carries at its extremity a steel stud, intended to be put in con
tact with the ends of the linear measures which we may have to
compare.
    Another fixed stud must be screwed and held very solidly on
a  board   or a table which holds the measures and all the ap
paratus.
    When we wish to compare any two linear measures, one of
them must first be placed in such a way that one of its extremities
   * I have a micrometer screw made by this able artist, two decimeters
in length. lie engaged to cut these divisions "at intervals of a half milli
meter, and he succeeded so well that the most rigid proofs could not dis
cover the least inequality that was sensible throughout the whole 200 di-
visions. This is one of the most difficult tasks that can be undertaken of
this kind.
                                                                      may

may rest against the fixed stud, ami its other end in contact with
the moveable one ; the whole being so disposed, that the axes of
the rules, the axis of the linear measures, and the middle points
of the divisions on the glass are exactly in right lines. The mi
croscope held by the same board, or the same table on which
the other parts of the apparatus and the linear measures are
laid, must be so pointed to one of the divisions on the glass,
that after some preliminary trials, or first approximative data,
on the ratios of the linear measures, we may be certain that the
second measure to be compared, when we have made the same
dispositions respecting        will bring the lOOdths or 200dths of
                                        it,                                            a
millimeter under       stroke, which
                          a                afterwards to be determined
                                                   is
when placed in the focus of the microscope            which microscope,
                                                                  ;
when the collimation -has been established, with respect to the
beginning of the divisions, must be kept immoveable during the
comparison of the two linear measures.
    The apparatus      to be disposed in such
                              is                    way, that the glass
                                                                  a
 carrving the divisions may be placed between the reflecting mir
 ror cf the microscope and the object lens             and     we wish to
                                                                       ;   if
 adjust the focus- line to the line at the beginning of the divisions,
 we make the supports of the microscope to abut against the point
 of  a fixed horizontal screw and nut this support being made to

                a
 between the focus-line and the strokes of the division              easilv     is
  obtained      by
                the hand,                by
                                causing the microscope to turn round

although they only undergo the magnifying power of the eye
glass.   1 received from     M. Breguet, member of the Board of
Longitude,   a platina  wire  made in England by an ingenious pro
cess.   This wire had been passed through a hole when enveloped
in a covering of silver; and when the compound of the two metals
had been reduced* to its greatest fineness, the silver was dissolved,
and the platina wire left                The maker had written on
                             uncovered.
the piece which contained the wire of which I speak the number
6000, to indicate that its diameter is ^^dth of a fraction of
an English foot, which M. Breguet thinks is a lme.          If he has
been rightly Informed in this respect, there is an enormous mis
calculation in the evaluation of the maker ; for his wire, when
stretched and put in contact with the division of lOOdthsof a mil
limeter, covered the interval between two strokes, and the strokes
themselves. Its magnitude is therefore more than 0-01 millimeter,
whilst the English evaluation only makes it 0*00035 millimeter :
and   if,as  am inclined to believe,
              I                        it   not GOOOdths of

but only 6,000dths of an inch, that he intended to indicate         the
                                                                    by
number 6000 written on the side of the wire, there        still an er

millimeter.
  This wire, which     has probably the greatest degree of fineness
that can be attained in the present state of the arts, does not
therefore give us the most delicate line that can be rendered
perceptible to the eye and my divisions of lOOdths of millimeters
                             ;
on glass serve as     proof frf this. The thickness of each line of
                         a
this division    only about the third of the length of the interval
                  is
contained between two immediately adjoining strokes; so that
this thickness         is,
                   according to what    1  have said above, less than
the third of the diameter of the English platina wire. For these
reasons   I have determined not to put the wire in the focus of the
microscope, but to put         piece of plain glass there, on which
                                 a
M. Richer has 'traced for me two lines at right angles, of such
a  degree of fineness and neatness, that when one of these lines
projects itself between two strokes of the divisions on glass, the
proportion between its distances from each adjoining stroke may
easily be estimated. This expedient affords also the advantage
of great solidity, and that of rendering the application of ver a
nier to the apparatus quite easy       by having on the glass in the
focus ten parallel strokes, which should cover       9or 11 of the di
visions of lOOdthsof a millimeter.

 that the eye still supports very well, causes the strokes marked
 on the glass, bearing the divisions into lOOdths of a millimeter, to
 disappear.    It has sometimes happened, that I have intercepted
 a part of this light by placing      my hand before the reflecting
 mirror: and I have remarked, that in seeking by the vertioal
motion of this hand the proper position for the degree of light
that I wanted, i made the point of collimation to vary within
the limits of about rffo^1'1 of a millimeter.      According to this
observation it is necessary, whilst we are comparing the linear
measures, to keep the quantity of light thrown on the divided
glass in the interior of the microscope always in the same state.
    The accuracy and convenience of my new comparer has al
ready been submitted to frequent trials.       The ratios of some of
the linear measures on which it has been tried had been deter
mined with the great comparer of M. Lenoir, and the agreement
between the results furnished by both instruments has been very
satisfactory.     Among the operations from which these results
are derived there. is one that I made with my colleagues Messrs.
Bouvard and Arrago.         One of the objects of comparison was
the standard platina metre of the observatory.

Dear Sir, —       In  consequence of the observations made in the>
preceding paper, on the size of the very fme platina wire so in
geniously contrived and made by Dr. Wollaston, I deemed it pro
per to inform him that I intended to present you with a transla
tion of M. de Prony's Memoir for publication in your valuable
Magazine.       I have accordingly been favoured by that gentleman
with the subjoined information on the subject, which not only
explains the difficulty, but informs us of the manner in which
the wire is produced, and the mode adopted for estimating its
size.    The portions of an inch called lines, which the French
scientific gentlemen use very commonly, are rarely employed in
this country: it was therefore very natural to conclude, that
M. Breguet must have made some mistake, in the statement of
its dimensions which he carried back with him to France, and
communicated to M. de Prony.                             %

                           To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —    In   your Magazine for List month, (p. 41,) in an article
entitled  "A Geologfcal   Sketch of a Part of Cumberland and West
moreland," your correspondent notices as a fact, that carbonate
of strontites has been found in the basalt of the Giant's Cause
way.     This is a circumstance that has frequently been noticed
to me, and specimens have been shown me, as carbonate of
strontites, which I have uniformly found to be carbonate of lime.
It is nothing uncommon to mistake the one substance for the
other, the carbonate of strontites from Braunsdorf in Saxon v
having long been considered as the hard carbonate of lime among
the German mineralogists. — I should therefore be glad to know
from your correspondent, through the medium of your Magazine,
whether the specimen he refers to has been submitted to ana
lysts.
    Your correspondent likewise notices that the clay-slate and
hwnblend slate of Skiddaw rest immediately on granite ; which
                                                              would

  Would lead one to believe that         granite occurred on Skiddaw it»
  self.   This  is not the case   : the nearest occurrence of granite to
  Skiddaw is at a considerable distance on the east of the moun
  tain, beyond where granite again occurs, on the road between
  Kendal and Chale.        There is a third station in that district of
  country where granite is also found ; on the sea coast, near
  Muncaster ; besides which in Wartdale, as well as at Buttermere,
  a species of rock occurs, which bears a strong resemblance to
 some varieties of granite.          I found the relations of these two
 last-mentioned      rocks so very obscurely marked, that I cannot
 pretend to give any opinion about them.              I notice the localities,
 with a view to      direct   the   attention   of  other   geologists.    My
 visits to this beautiful country have been pretty much like those
 of other tourists ; 1 have therefore had little time to follow up
 any observations. — I have seldom found any country so very
 puzzling to make out, or to describe geologically in any thing
 like a satisfactory manner.         To this, therefore, I attribute the
 neglect   it  appears    to  have   experienced.      It remains a fertile
 source of geological disquisition,       and  theorists will find it as dif
ficult to accommodate to their respective opinions as any district
 between this and Kamschatka.

                               To   Mr. Tillnch.
 Sir, '— Happening            a few evenings ago to be in a company
of persons       supposed    to be distinguished by their learning and
acquirements, the subject of conversation accidentally turned on
the nature of the evidences of different truths or certainties ; when
the Editor of one of our Monthly Journals being present, he
with great earnestness maintained, that there is no kind of su
periority in mathematical certainty over that arising from testi
mony ;     "  and mathematicians (said he) have deceived themselves
into a contrary belief, from not being aware that every two
things, said by them to be demonstrated to be equal, are in
reality Me same thing !. When for instance (continued he) they
say, the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones,
their reasoning only amounts to showing that they are the same!"
and so on.
     One of the company happening now to remark, that this was
but to over-look the distinction between and to confound equa-
                                       I 2                                UhJ

lily   and identity ; and looking round and perceiving a sup
pressed smile in the countenances of some of his auditors, the
first speaker resumed, by saying, that he considered the evidence
of various historical facts, such for instances, that there was
such a man as Julius Caesar, and that there is such a place as
Rome, &c. as not less complete and perfect, with any mathema
tical truth whatever!. " Nay (continued he), I have even been as-
sured by single persons of some- things, I as firmly believe as I
do any truths whatsoever !."
    Perceiving now a more general and stronger tendency to
 smiling, in the attentive circle arouud him, the speaker (who is
 a North Briton) rather hastily concluded, by saving, " I know
 that in this country such opinions are only laughed at, and that
 every English mathematician holds a different opinion : but that
 shall not induce me to change mine :" — and I think I heard him
 add, while the group which had stood around him was in the
 act of separating, that he intended shortly to enlarge on these
 topics in his Journal.
     Relying confidently, as I do, on the issue of anv investigation
 into the paramount pretensions of mathematical, over almost
 all, if not every other kind of certainty (which latter are in
 deed but probabilities,    sometimes of a very high amount it is
 admitted*),    I sincerely hope that the learned Editor will not
 fail of either supporting or retracting his rather singular opinions,
  as above mentioned.      Whether this may or may not happen
 to be the case, I judge it proper to request the favour of vour
  insertion of this notice of these opinions ; and to request of
  some more able hand, who heard them advanced, or others, to
  enter without delay on their refutation in your Magazine, which
  will oblige,

 ftum.    This method completely answered the purpose ; but hav
  ing observed that this oil gave out a strong and disagreeable
 smell, and that it evaporated too quickly, he conceived that the
 different essences extracted from vegetables, without being at
 tended with the same inconveniences, might give to paper a
 sufficient degree of transparency to allow a drawing upon which
 it might be laid to be distinctly seen through it.
     For this purpose he employed essence of lavender, or oil of
 spike, and essence of citron, which are preferable to or! of petro
 leum ; because instead of having a bad smell they yield a very
  agreeable perfume : and as they evaporate more slowly, the
 paper retains its transparency for a greater length of time, by
  which means the operation of copying is facilitated.
     The essences used for this process ought to be as limpid as
  the purest water. If they were coloured, they would leave marks
 and stains upon the paper. They are rarely to be met with in
 commerce in a state of sufficient purity ; but they may be easily
 freed from their colouring particles by a second distillation.
     Take a sheet of common drawing paper, and smear it on one
 side only with a brush dipped into the essence.           The space thus
 rendered transparent should be about seven or eight decimetres
-square; for, if it be much, larger, the essence may evaporate be
 fore the drawing is finished, and the paper lose its transpa
 rency.
    This done, lay the paper upon the drawing, and trace with
 the pencil the strokes that are seen underneath.          Having copied
 the drawing upon that part of the paper which has been smeared
 with the essence, rub it upon the other parts, and thus proceed
till the whole is finished. Then hold the paper before the fire,
 shaking it gently to accelelate the evaporation ; taking care that
 it be at such a distance that the hand can bear the heat without
 inconvenience.      When the evaporation is completed, the paper
 again becomes opaque, and retains all its original whiteness. You
imay then draw upon it with a pen, wash or paint with colours.
    The process is as easy in practice as it is advantageous, on ac<-
-count of the time which it saves,, and the precision and accuracy
with which you obtain jac-similes of prints and drawings that
 you wish to copy.

that the       watch-lights, those of the powder-room, &c. should
transmit     the light through horn, or other substance capable of
resisting    great shocks.      This material is at present sufficiently
plentiful,     and is very well manufactured, in France : but as it
fell short    in the magazines at the beginning of the revolution,
M. Rochon supplied its place for the ship-lanterns by a net
work of wire, of a large mesh, covered with a light coat of
transparent isinglass.        This artificial horn was at that time of
 great service in the navy.
    The arrival of an American vessel having on board several
pieces of foliated mica perfectly transparent,              suggested to
M. Rochon the idea of employing it in the place of glass or horn,
in preference to isinglass and copal varnish.            This mineral is
found in abundance in the quarries of granite in the environs of
Newport in North America.              Hitherto it has been only known
in the district of Witten, in Siberia, which furnishes it in large
flakes.     The preparation of this mineral, to render it of use as
a medium for transmitting light. consists in separating          in plates,
                                                               it.
more or less thick, with     a    double-edged knife.      The Siberians,
says the traveller Gmelin, use these transparent plates as much
for their windows as for their lanterns. The Russian navy con
sumes  a    great deal of
                        it   ;   all the window-lights of the vessels are
of this substance, which, independent of its great transparency,
resists the strong shock of artillery.          The surfaces of the flakes
or plates of this incombustible mineral are about two ells square.
M. Vaiujuelin has found in ten parts of silcx, seven of alumine
                                 it                                           ;
and the limits of its specific weight are, according to the calcu
lations of M. Brissot, between 265 and 293.
    We are assured that the Americans use foliated mica for the
same purposes as the Russians. They employ also deinispherical
masses     of   glass to reflect the rays of light in such parts of the
vessels where the blowing of the wind will not allow of lanterns.
    Although we might be able to procure squares of mica suffi
ciently transparent, and thick enough to resist the most violent
blows, the necessity of oeconomizing       a    substance so rare, and to
give  it  the utmost degree of transparency, determined M. Rochon
to inclose      itbetween two pieces of tinned iron net-work of largea
mesh.       The wires of thes,e meshes, which are manufactured in
a weaver's loom, do not intercept      a     hundredth part of the light.
By these     means     he
                        is    enabled to make the squares of an unli
mited size with plates that are of unequal sizes.            Gum arabic
 serves to connect them together; and with some very fine cop

the magazines of the navy being at that time unprovided with
panes of sufficient dimensions, M. Rochon promptly supplied the
deficiency, by putting up panes made of the mica of Newport.
We see, therefore, that this substance may be rendered useful
for such purposes, although it does not appear that the navy have
yet adopted it.      Its dearness is probably the reason. The same
reason too will, doubtless, for a long time, prevent it from being
brought into domestic use ; and our ordinary lanterns happily
at present require no alteration.

  Elements   of Electricity and Electro- Chemistry.      By Georgb
                          John Singer, Esq.
                           [Continued  from p. 62.]
 -The third part of Mr. Singer's work treats of the "natural
agencies of electricity," and includes four chapters, arranged as
 follows :
     Chap. I. On the identity of electrjcity and the cause of
lightning.
    Chap. II.    On the phaenomena of thunder-storms, and on the
probable sources of atmosphereical electricity.
    Chap. III. On some luminous phaenomena of the atmo
sphere, the observations of atmospherical electricity ? and the ar
rangement of a new system of insulation.
    Chap. IV. Connexion of electricity with medicine and with
natural historv.
    The utility' of this part of the treatise renders it highly in
teresting ; and we observe • with pleasure, that Mr. Singer has
bestowed particular attention on the most useful applications of
electrical science, and that he has given very extensive practical
information on this part of his subject.        We cannot attempt to
convey   more   than   a general  idea  of the  ample details this por
tion of the work contains.        The following is extracted from the
description of a lightning conductor, p. 224.
                                                      " The conduct
ing rod or rods (for if the building is large there should be se
veral) should be formed of copper or iron, three quarters of an
inch thick.       Its upper extremity should be acutely pointed,
and rise three or four feet above the highest part of the building.
The parts of which the rod is formed should be joined closely; the
ends that are applied to each other being screwed together. AJ1
the metallic parts of the roof should be connected with the rod,
                                    14                              and

and it should pass down in as direct a line as possible, and pe
netrate several feet below the foundation, from which it should
be inclined outward.        The underground part of the conductor
is better formed of copper, to prevent its decav; it should be
connected, if it possibly can, with a moist stratum of earth or
with a large body of water.        The penetration of the conductor
to some depth below the level of the foundation, will in many
instances procure this advantage for it.      The conductor is some
times made wholly of copper, it may then be thinner than if
made of iron : for a stationary conductor, I should conceive that
a copper rod of half an inch thick would answer every required
purpose ; and there is little doubt that a less quantity of nletal
made into a hollow tube so as to increase its superficies would
be equally or even more effectual.        Conductors for ships have
been made of chains (which are highly improper) and of cop
per wires which are easily attached : but they are with equal
ease detached ; and I have been informed by several captains,
that in many ships furnished with such conductors, they are kept
in an inactive state packed up below during long and hazardous!
voyages.     For this reason it would be better that fixed con
 ductors should be employed ; they might I should conceive be
 attached to the mast, and where motion is required an inter
ruption should be made in the inflexible conductor, and its parts
be connected together by a length of spiral wire, which would
be- at once perfectly continuous, and sufficiently flexible to yield
 to every necessary movement."
    Conductors for ships will be much more effectual if they are
 connected with a strip of metal surrounding the deck, and con-,
 tinued to the copper-bottom.         Carriages which are usually fil
leted round with metal for ornament, may be rendered very se
 cure if these strips are connected with each other, and continued
 over every edge, so as to surround the prominences of the carriage
completely, a metallic communication being continued from them-
to the ground. In the open air Mr. Singer advises that shelter be
not sought beneath a high tree, or building,- but considers a di
stance of twenty or thirty feet from them as rather an eligible
situation.     He particularly insists on the necessity of avoiding
 every approach to large masses of water, and even to the stream
 lets which may have resulted from a recent shower ; for they are
all excellent conductors, and likely to determine the direction of
the explosion,      fn a house, the-partial conductors which usually
determine    the  course  of the discharge are for the most part the
appendages     of  the  walls and partitions ; the most secure situa-
t'on, therefore, is the middle of the room ; and this may be ren
dered more so, by standing on a glass-legged stool, a mattress,
or even a thick woollen hearth-rug. The middle story is the
                                                                most

most secure : for explosions sometimes occur from the earth to
the clouds ; and many instances are on record in which the lowest
story of a building has been the only part which has sustained
injury ; hence it is absurd to take refuge in a cellar, or cave, &c.
Chimneys     are   excellent conductors, from the soot or charcoal
with which they      are lined : consequently it is essential to avoid
any approach to the fire-place : and the same caution is neces
sary w.ith respect to gilt furniture, bell wires, and extensive sur
faces of metal of every description.     In a carriage, the precaution
of keeping at some distance from its back and sides is also ad
visable.    The several varieties of the thunder-storm are shown
to be closely imitated by a proper use of the electrical apparatus;
and the source of the vast accumulations of electricity by which
these phenomena are produced, is traced to the circulation of wa
ter in the atmosphere : hence thunder occurs most frequently in
summer, and storms are most tremendous               ill,

nature of these natural processes of excitation            at present far

from being clearly understood      ;  but the analogy between them
and many of our artificial .methods           clearly described in the

has been seen, that change of form, heating and cooling, fric
tion, and the contact of dissimilar bodies, are the artificial sources
of electrical excitation, and the clouds experience in succession
the operation of all these causes."          The opinions of Volta,
Saussure, De Luc, &c. are given with great impartiality, and
as fully as is  consistent with the nature of the work.
   The phenomena of the northern lights, and other luminous ap
pearances of the atmosphere, are also treated at some length                  ;
and this section deserves notice for the clearness with which the
various facts arc stated. The author shows          marked distinction
                                                     a
between the larger and smaller meteors.          He considers the lat
ter as very analogous to the appearances of electricity            but the
                                                                      ;
larger  meteors   he  regards as incapable  of explanation     in the  pre
sent state of our knowledge.
   In' describing the means of observing atmospherical electricity,
an account   is given of a very remarkable- apparatus for that pur
pose, which has been recentlv constructed            our correspondent
                                                       by
Mr. Crosse of Broomfield.        It     described as " consisting of
                                       is
copper wire, one-sixteenth of an inch thick, stretched and insu
lated between stout upright masts of from 100 to 10 feet in           1
height.    The most unwearied exertion has been employed to

1SS                Notices respecting New Books.
give unexampled extent and perfection to this apparatus : the
insulated wire has been extended to the extraordinary length of
one mile and a quarter ; and a variety of ingenious contrivances
have been applied to preserve the insulation.   But the length                of
the wire rendered it so liable to injury, and subject to depreda
tion, that it has been found expedient to shorten it to 180O
feet, and until the present time no means have been devised
that sufficiently preserve the insulation during a dense fog, or
driving snow."
   The apparatus has been preserved in constant activity during
eighteen months ; and a series of observations have been made
with   it,which afford some very interesting information on the
subject of atmospherical electricity.     The details which Mr.
Singer has given are, however, too extensive for the limits of
this notice  ; and we must refer the reader to the work itself for
the information they .contain.
    In pursuing these inquiries, Mr. Singer has been led to dis      a
covery of the first importance to the practical electrician.            is
                                                                         It
well known that one of the most perplexing cares attendant on
electrical experiments,     the preservation of the insulating parts
                            is
 of the apparatus in perfectly dry state and in moist weather
                      a                              ;
 this isso far from practicable, that many experiments are from
necessity avoided in consequence.          Mr. Singer has contrived
an arrangement      wbich  prevents the free contact of the air
with the surface of the insulator, and consequently precludes
the deposition of moisture upon            it,
                                         and preserves    itin a proper
state for use under nearly every variation of weather.               The
 gold-leaf electrometer constructed on this principle becomes
a  truly valuable instrument      : retains its electricity for
                                      it                             con
                                                                     a
siderable period  ; and as      scarcely
                                 it       ever requires  to  be- warmed
or wiped,    ismuch more useful, and less liable to be deranged,
than in the old construction.     The description which        isgiven of
this method of insulation       nearly confined to the development
                                 is
of its general principle, and       by no means so extensive as we
                                      is
could have wished; for we deem            one of the most useful dis

for some time.
    The experiments    of Nollet and others on the action of elec

practice of medical electricity, which         developed with much

Che general title of Galvanism, because it originated entirely
with the experiments of tlie learned professor of Bologna. Under
the arrangement which            is here given to        it,
                                                     Galvanism certainly
forms   a   very proper introduction to the fourth and last part of
Mr. Singer's work, which has for its subject "Voltaic electricity."
 This subject, the most novel, and to many the most interesting
before us,   is discussed in four chapters under the following titles:

 electrical phenomena.

 employs river water only, as the medium of connexion between
his plates, and finds       itpreferable for this purpose to any acid
mixture.      " With series of 50 groups delicate gold-leaf elec

 sitive
      ;    that of the copper side always negative."          By employing
 water  in   his Voltaic apparatus Mr. Singer has discovered that
 the powers of that apparatus may be accumulated in an electrical
 battery, which, when connected with               will always be charged

  cellent one ; for it maintains its action without any renewed at
  tention for months, and probably for years: and as the effect in
 creases with the number of plates employed, Mr. Singer suggests
 that, by employing 50 or 100,000 plates, a considerable charge
 might be constantly kept up in an electrical battery, and that at
  no expense but the first cost of the apparatus ; which would be
  sufficient if formed of plates two inches square.
     In noticing the chemical action of the Voltaic apparatus it is
  remarked, that its operations are very different to those of com
  mon electricity, which are usually attended by mechanical action,
  and rarely by any unequivocal production of heat ; whilst in the
  Voltaic apparatus when no light is evolved an elevation of tem
 perature may be usually observed : and when by its intense ac
 tion there is a copious evolution of light, heat is produced in a
  superior degree to that which results from any other process of
 art. When metals are revived from their solutions by Voltaic
 ,electricity, it is noticed as a singular fact, that none but lead,
 tin, and silver, appear as brilliant metallic vegetations. The
  various experiments of decomposition and transfer, with the in
 teresting discoveries of Sir H. Davy, are detailed with great ac
 curacy and perspicuity, accompanied by occasional observations
 of the author which tend considerably to the elucidation of the
 (subject.    So much information is indeed included in this part
 of the work, that we have no wish to lessen the interest it is cal
 culated to excite, by giving a series of abridged extracts from
 that which should be read in its complete state.      Considerable
attention is given to the experiments and observations of Dr.
 Wollaston, Sir H. Davy, and others -who have made useful re
 searches on the subject.       The facts throughout appear to be
 stated with great impartialitv, and the remarks and experiments
of the author evince a very perfect acquaintance with his sub
ject, and habits of research and inquiry which cannot fail to
Tender an essential service to the cause in which they are em
ployed.      We are pleased to observe that no attempt is made to
 add to the various hypotheses that have been advanced to ac
count for the phenomena of Voltaic electricity: the experiments
 and observations of the author appear rather to support the
opinions of Volta ; yet no hypothesis is insisted on, but the
deficiences of the principal ones that have been proposed are
noticed very freely, and with a spirit highly characteristic of the
 independent feelings of the writer.
    The ingenious analysis of the Voltaic apparatus by our valu
able correspondent, M. De Luc, is noticed with considerable ap
probation by Mr. Singer, who has extended the experiments of

 Supplement to the Fourth and Fifth Editions of Ike Encyclo
      pedia Bfitannica, Volume I. Part I. with a Preliminary Dis
       sertation, " exhibiting a general View of the Progress of meta
       physical, ethical, and political Philosophy since" the Revival
       of Letters in Europe.     By Dugald Stewart, Esq. F.R.SS.
       Lond.. & Edin., &c. &c." Edinburgh : Constable and Co.
       We notice the above most valuable publication, chiefly with a
 view to call the attention of our readers to the very learned and
 copious dissertation on the progress of human knowledge, which
  Professor Dugald Stewart has prefixed.
       To follow this elegant writer and profound scholar seriatim,
 through his enumeration of those who have contributed to the
  advancement of science and philosophy since the revival of let
  ters would far exceed the limits which we have prescribed to
  ourselves in this department of our work ; but we have been so
  smitten with the eloquent and comprehensive review which Mr.
  Stewart has given of the philosophical life and writings of the
  great Bacon, that we presume to think that our readers will
  consider some extracts from that part of the preliminary disser
  tation as affording an intellectual treat of rare occurrence.
        " The state of science," the author philosophically observes,
   " towards the close of the sixteenth century presented a field
   of observation singularly calculated to attract the curiosity and
   to awaken the genius of Bacon ; nor was it the least of Lis per
   sonal advantages, that, as the son of one of Queen Elizabeth's
   ministers, he had a ready access, wherever he went, to the most
   enlightened society in Europe.       While yet only in the seven
   teenth year of his age, he was removed by his father from Cam
   bridge to Paris, where it is not to be doubted that the novelty
   of the literary scene must have largely contributed to cherish
    the natural liberality and independence of his mind.      Sir Joshua
    Reynolds has remarked, in one of his academical discourses, that
    '
       every seminary of learning is surrounded with an atmosphere
    of floating knowledge, where every mind may imbibe somewhat
    congenial to its own original conceptions.'        He might have
    added, with still greater truth, that it is an atmosphere, of which
    it is more peculiarly salutary for those who have been elsewhere
     reared to breathe the air.    The remark is applicable to higher
     pursuits than were in the contemplation of this philosophical
     artist ; and it suggests a hint of no inconsiderable value for the
      education of youth.
                                                                   **  The

      "The   merits of Bacon, as the father of experimental phi
   losophy, are so universally acknowledged, that it would be su
  perfluous to touch upon them here.             The lights which he h-ae
  struck out in various branches of the philosophy of mind, have
  been much less attended to ; although the whole scope and te
  nor of^his speculations show, that to this study his genius was
  far more strongly and happily turned, than to tha? of the ma
  terial world.    It was not, as some seem to have imagined, by
  sagacious anticipations of particular discoveries afterwards to be
  made in physics, that his writings have had so powerful an in
  fluence in accelerating the advancement of that science.          In the
  extent and accuracy of his physical knowledge, he was far in
  ferior to many of his predecessors; but he surpassed them all
  in his knowledge of the laws, the resources, and the limits of
  the human understanding.           The sanguine expectations with -
 v. hich he looked     forward to the future, were founded solely on
 Lis confidence in the untried capacities of the mind; and on a
 conviction of the possibility of invigorating and guiding, by means
 of logical rules, those faculties which, in all our researches after
 truth, .^re the organs or instruments to be employed.              *
                                                                      Such
 rules,' as he himself has observed,           '  do in some sort equal
 men's wits, and leave no great advantage or pre-eminence to the
 perfect and excellent motions of the spirit.          To draw a straight
 line, or to describe a circle, by aim of hand only, there must be
a great difference between an unsteady and unpractised hand,
 and a steady and practised; but to do it by rule or compass it
 is much alike.'
     "  Nor is it merely as a logician that Bacon is entitled to no
tice on the present occasion.         It would be difficult to name an
other writer prior to Locke, whose works are enriched with so
many just observations on the intellectual phenomena.              Among
 these, the most valuable relate to the laws of memory, and of
imagination ; the latter of which subjects he seems to have
studied with peculiar caTe.        In one short but beautiful paragraph
concerning poetry (under        which   title may be comprehended a!!
the various     creations   of  this  faculty) he has exhausted every
thing that philosophy and good sense have yet had to offer, on
what has been since called the Beau Ideal; a topic, which has
furnished occasion to so many over-refinements among the French
critics, and to so much extravagance and mysticism in the cloud-
capt metaphysics of the new German school.                 In considering
imagination     as  connected    with  the  nervous   system, more parti
cularly   as connected    with that species   of   sympathy to which me
dical writers have given the name of imitation, he has suggested
some very fim portant hints, which none of his successors have
hitherto prgsecuted ; and has, at the same time, left an example

of cautious inquiry, worthy to            be studied by all who may attempt
to investigate the laws regulating the union between mind and
body.     His illustration of the different classes of prejudices
incident to human nature,           is,
                              in point of practical utility, at least
equal to any thing on that head to be found in Locke of whom           ;
it   is  impossible to forbear remarking, as               circumstance not
                                                              a
easily explicable, that he should have resumed this important
discussion, without once mentioning the name of his great pre
decessor-       The chief improvement made by Locke, in the
further prosecution of the argument,            the application of Hobbes's
                                                is
theory    of association, to  explain   ill  what  manner these prejudices
are originally generated.

philosophy of the mind, strictly so called, nothing                      more re

markable than the precise and just ideas they display of the pro
per aim of this science.        He had manifestly reflected much and
successfully    on  the operations of his own understanding, and had
studied with uncommon sagacity the intellectual characters of
others.      Of his reflections and observations on both subjects, he
has recorded many important results              ;and has in general stated
 them without the slightest reference to any physiological theory
Concerning their causes, or to any analogical explanations founded
 on the caprices of metaphorical language.                    If,

 communication between soul and body,                  must be remembered,

 Locke.      Nor ought    itto be overlooked           mention      to the cre

     " While Bacon, however, so cautiously avoids these unpro

  above those of brutes, merely like the sun aboVe the stars, of
   like gold above other metals.'
      " Among the various topics started by Bacon for the consi
   deration of future logicians, he did not overlook (what may be
  justly regarded, in a practical view, as the most interesting of
   all logical problems) the question concerning the mutual influ
                                                            ' Men
   ence of thought and of language on each other.                   believe,'
               ' that  their  reason           their words     but   it often
   says lie,                          governs                ;
  happens that words have power enough to re-act upon reason.'
  This aphorism may be considered as the text of by far the most
   valuable part of Locke's Essay, — (hat which relates to the
   imperfections and abuse of words ; but it was not till within the
   last twenty years that its depth and importance were perceived
-  in all their extent.      I need scarcely say, that I allude to the
   excellent Memoirs of M. Prevost and of M. Degerando, ' On
   Signs considered in their Connexion with the Intellectual Ope
   rations.'     The anticipations formed by Bacon, of that branch of
   modern logic which rafctes to universal grammar, do no less
   honour to his sagacity.        '.Grammar,' he observes, ' is of two
   kinds, the one literal}', the other philosophical.       The former has
   for its object to trace the analogies running through the structure
   of a particular tongue, so as to facilitate its acquisition to a
   foreigner, or to enable him to speak it with correctness and
   purity.     The latter directs the attention, not to the analogies
   which words bear to words, but to the analogies which words
   bear to things ;' or, as he afterwards explains himself more
             ' to
   clearly,        language considered as the sensible portraiture or
   image of the mental processes.'        In further illustration of these
   hints, he takes notice of the lights which the different genius of
   different languages reflects on the characters and habits of those
   by whom they were respectively spoken.
                                                     ' Thus,'
                                                                says he,  'it
   is easy to perceive that the Greeks were addicted to the culture
   of the arts, the Romans engrossed with the conduct of affairs ;
   inasmuch as the technical distinctions introduced in the pro
   gress of refinement require the aid of compounded words ; while
   the real business of life stands in no need of so artificial a phraseo
   logy.' Ideas of this sort have, in the course of a very few
   years, already become common, and almost tritica! ; but how
   different was the case two centuries ago !
       " With these sound and enlarged views concerning the philo
   sophy of the mind, it will not appear surprising to those who
   have attended to the slow and irregular advances of human rea
   son, that Bacon should occasionally Vllend incidental remarks,
   savouring of the habit s of thinking prevalent in his time.              A
   cwrious example of this occurs in the same chapter -which con
   tains his excellent definition or description of universal grammar.
                                                                       ' This

 ' Tliis too,'  he observes, ' is worthy of notice, that the ancient
 languages were full of declensions, of cases, of conjugations, of
 tenses, and of other similar inflections : while the modern, al
 most elitirelv destitute of these, indolentlv accomplish the same
 purpose bv the help of prepositions, and of auxiliary verbs.
'Whence,' he continues, ' may be inferred (however we may
 flatter ourselves with the idea of our own superiority), that the
 human intellect was much more acute and subtile in ancient
 than it now. is in modern times.'      How very unlike is this last
 reflection to the usual strain of Bacon's writings!     It seems, in
deed, much more congenial to the philosophy of Mr Harris and
©f Lord     Monboddo ; and it has accordingly been sanctioned
with the approbation of both these learned authors.              If my
memory does not deceive me, it is the only passage in Bacon's
works, which Lord Monboddo has anywhere condescended to
quote.
    "  These observations afford me a convenient opportunity for
remarking the progress and diffusion of the philosophical spirit,
since the beginning of the seventeenth century.          In the short
 passage just cited from Bacon, there are involved no less than
two capital errors, which are now almost universally ranked, by
men of education, among the grossest prejudices of the multi
 tude.    The one, that the declensions and conjugations of the
 ancient languages, and the modern substitution in their place
of prepositions and auxiliary verbs, are, both of them, the deli
berate and "ystematical contrivances of speculative grammarians;
the other (still less analogous to Bacon's general style of rea
soning), that the faculties of man have declined as the world
has grown older.       Both of these errors may be now said to have
disappeared entirely.      The latter, more particularly, must, to
the rising generations seem so absurd, that it almost requires an
apologv to have mentioned it. That the capacities of the hu
man mind have been in all ages the same ; and that the diversity
of phsenomena exhibited bv our species is the result merely of
the different circumstances in which men are placed, lias been
long received as an incontrovertible logical maxim ; or rather,
such is the influence of early instruction, that we are apt to re
gard it as one of the most obvious suggestions of common sense.
And yet, till about the time of Montesquieu, it was by no means
so generallv recognised by the learned, as to have i sensible in
fluence on the fashionable tone of thinking over Emope.            The
application    of this fundamental and leading idea    to   the natural
or theoretical history of society in all its various aspects; — to
the history of languages, of the arts, of the sciences, of laws, of
government, of manners, and of religion, — is the peculiar glory

    " It wotild be endless to particularize the original suggestions
thrown out by Bacon on topics connected with the science of
mind. The few passages of this sort already quoted, are pro
                                                                          -

happened to be those which had left the strongest impression on
mv memorvj I thought them as likely as any other, to invite
the curiosity of mv readers to a careful examination of the rich
mine from which thev are extracted.
    " The ethical disquisitions of Bacon are almost entirely of a
practical nature.        Of the two theoretical questions so much
agitated, in both parts of this island, during the eighteenth cen
tury, concerning the principle and the object of moral approba
tion, he has said nothing ; but he has opened some new and in
teresting views with respect to the influence of custom and the for
mation of habits;— a most important article of moral philoso
phy, on which he has enlarged more ably and more usefully than
any writer since Aristotle.       Under the same head of Ethics may
be mentioned the small volume to which he has given the title
 of Essays; the best known and the most popular of all his works.
 It is also one of those where the superiority of his genius appears
to the greatest advantage ; the novelty and depth of his re
 flections often receiving a strong relief from the triteness of his
 subject.    It may be read from beginning to end in a few hours,
 — and yet, after the twentieth perusal, one seldom fails to re
 mark in it something overlooked before.            This, indeed, is a
 characteristic  of a.11 Bacon's  writings, and is only to be accounted
 for by the inexhaustible aliment they furnish to our own thoughts,
 and the sympathetic activity they impart to our torpid faculties.
     " The suggestions of Bacon for the improvement of political
 philosophy, exhibit as strong a contrast to the narrow systems
 of contemporary statesmen, as the inductive logic to that of the
 schools.. How profound and comprehensive are the views opened
 in the following passages, when compared with the scope of the
 celebrated treatise De Jure Belli et Pads ! a work which was
 lirst published about a year before Bacon's death, and which
 continued, for a hundred and fifty years afterwards, to be regarded
 in all the protestant universities of Europe as an inexhaustible
 treasure of moral and jurisprudential wisdom !
    "   ' The ultimate
                           object which legislators ought to have in
 view, and to which all their enactments and sanctions ought to
  be subservient,   is, that ike citizens may live happily.      For this
  purpose,it   isnecessary    that they should  receive  a religious and
 pious education    j  that they should be trained to good morals       ;
                                                                     that

that they should be secured from foreign enemies by proper' mi
litary arrangements ; that they should be guarded by an effectual
police against seditions and piivate injuries ; that they should be
loyal to government, and obedient to magistrates ; and finally,
that they should abound in wealth, and ill other national re
sources.' — ' The science of such matters certainly belongs more
particularly to the province of men who, by habits of public
business, have been led to take a comprehensive survey of the
social order ; of the interests of the community at large ; of the
rules of natural equity; of the manners of nations; of the dif
ferent forms of government ; and who are thus prepared to rea
son concerning the wisdom of laws, both from considerations of
justice and of policy.        The great desideratum, accordingly,           is,
 by  investigating   the  principles of natural justice, and those of
political expediency, to exhibit a theoretical model of legisla
tion, which, while     it    serves as a standard for estimating the
comparative excellence of municipal codes, may suggest hints
for their correction and improvement, to such as have at heart
the welfare of mankind.'
    " How precise the notion was that Bacon had formed of a
philosophical system of jurisprudence (with which as standard a
the municipal laws of different nations might be compared), ap
pears from   a   remarkable expression, in which he mentions           itas

    " The remark of Bacon on the systematica! policy of Henry
VII.  was manifestly suggested by the same train of thinking.
' His laws
             (whoso marks them well) were- deep and not vulgar ;
not made on the spur of a particular occasion for the present,
but out of providence for the future ; to make the estate of his
people still more and more happy, after the manner of the legis
lators in ancient and heroic times.'   How far this noble eulogy
 was merited, either by the legislators of antiquity, or by the
 modern prince on whom Bacon has bestowed                  a question of
                                                         it,   is

 tho:.e artificial obstacles which check the progressive tendencies
 of society.    It    probable that, on jtbis occasion, Bacon had an

 to the effects of which (whatever were the motives of its author)

in his general views and maxims, than in the details of his po
 litical theories, that Bacon's sagacity appears to advantage.          Bs     I
 notions with respect to commercial policy seem to have been
 more peculiarly erroneous        originating in an overweening opi
                                     ;
 nion of the efficacy of law,      matters where natural causes ought

 to be allowed    a free operation.           observed

 that the statutes of Henry VII. relating to the police of his
kingdom, are generally contrived with more judgement than his
commercial regulations.        The same writer adds, that the more   *
simple ideas     of order  and  equity are sufficient to guide      legis a
lator in everything that regards the internal administration of
justice but that the principles of commerce are much more
         ;
complicated, and require long experience and deep reflection to
be well understood in any state.        The real consequence         thereis
often contrary to first appearances.         No wonder that during
 the reign of Henry VII. these matters were frequently mistaken                    ;

               ' During the
                              reign,' fays he, ' pf Henry VII. it was*
prohibited to export horses, as if that exportation did not en
courage the breed, and make them more plentiful in the king
dom.      Prices were , also affixed to woollen cloths, to caps and
hats, and the wages of labourers were regulated by law.            It M
evident that these matters ought always         to be left free, and  he
intrusted to the common course of business and commerce.' ,          —
* For a like
                reason,' the historian continues, ' the law enaeted
against inclosures, and for the keeping up of farm-houses,
scarcely deserves the praises bestowed on it by Lord Bacon.            If
husbandmen understand agriculture, and have a ready vent for
their commodities, we need not dread a diminution of the people
employed in the country.         During a century and a half after
this period, there was a frequent renewal of laws and edicts
against depopulation ; whence we may infer, that none of them
were ever executed.        The naluial course of improvement at last
provided a remedy.'
    " These acute and decisive strictures on the impolicy of some
laws highly applauded by Bacon, while they strongly illustrate
the narrow and mistaken views in political ceconomy entertained
by the wisesr statesmen and philosophers two centuries ago, afford
at the same time a proof of the general diffusion which has since
taken place among the people of Great Britain, of juster and
more enlightened opinions on this important branch of legisla
tion. Wherever such doctrines find their way into the page of
history, it may be safely inferred that the public mind is not in
disposed to give them a welcome reception.
    " The ideas of Bacon concerning the education of youth,
were such as might be expected from a philosophical statesman.
On the conduct of education in general, with a view to the de
velopment and improvement of the intellectual character, he has
suggested various useful hints in different parts of his works : but
what 1 wish chiefly to remark at present           is,
                                                  the paramount im
portance which he has attached to the education of the people,
— comparing (as he has repeatedly done) the effects of early cul
ture on the understanding and the heart, to the abundant har
vest which rewards the diligent husbandman for the toils of the
spring.    To this analogy he seems to have been particularly
 anxious to attract the attention of his readers, by bestowing on
education the title of the Georg'ws       the mind
                                         of            identifying,

 a happy and impressive metaphor, the two proudest functions
 intrusted to the legislator, — the encouragement of agricultural
 industry, and the care of national instruction.    In both instances,
 the legislator exerts   a  power which       literally productive or
                                              is

dormant seeds of genius and virtue, and redeeming from the
neglected wastes of human intellect, a new and unexpected ac
cession to the common inheritance of mankind.
   " When from such speculations as these we descend to the
treatise De Jure Belli et Paris, the contrast is mortifying in
deed.     And yet, so much better suited were the talents and ac
complishments of Grotius to the taste not only of his contem
poraries but of their remote descendants, that, while the merits
of Bacon failed, for a century and a half, to command the ge
neral admiration of Europe, Grotius continued, even in our Bri
tish universities, the acknowledged oracle of jurisprudence and of
ethics, till long after the death of Montesquieu.    Nor was Bacon
himself unapprised of the slow growth of his posthumous fame.
No writer seems ever to have felt more deeply, that he properly
belonged to a later and more enlightened age; — a sentiment
which he has pathetically expressed in that clause of his testa
ment, where he " bequeaths his name to posterity, after some
generations shall be past."

 paper, which is the third and concluding one on this curious sub
ject,   entered into a very wide field of physiological research, and
 embraced      many singular conclusions and general inferences,
 which cannot    be adequately detailed in this abstract. The author
 states, that the sanguiferous system can exist independent of the
 nerves ; but the latter cnn stimulate the former, or retard and
 even totally obstruct it. He next took an extensive view of se
 cretion, as connected with these systems, the ganglia and spinal
 marrow. Animal heat he considers a secretion* When the fluids
 secreted by the glands are accumulated, secretion is not there
 fore suspended ; on the contrary, its continuance is necessary to
 the healthy state of the glands and the other vital functions.
 Secretion and galvanism he thinks produce similar effects. In
 conclusion the author observed, that in all his experiments he
 had, wherever it was practicable without injury to the result, de
 stroyed the sensibility of the animal previous to the commence
 ment of his operations, and had also avoided all unnecessary re
 petition of cruel experiments, or any useless waste of animal life.
 He proceeded to lay down some general and very judicious rules
 to avoid crueltv in making such experiments, and reflected on
 the conduct of some French physiologists in this respect. The
 object, he observed^ of such operations is the ultimate advantage
 of society : if that be obtainable, it was weakness, and not hu
 manity, to reject or decline them ; if not, it would be wanton
 cruelty.
    A letter from Dr. Brewster to the right honourable President
 was read, relating some new experiments on the double refractive
 powers of fluate of lime and muriate of soda.        Haiiy had justly
 observed, that all crystals have regular cubes, or tetrahedrons j
 for their integral molecules are devoid of the property of double re
 fracting crystals. Malus and Biot confirmed this observation ; but
 Dr. B. has discovered, that under peculiar circumstances fluate of
 lime and muriate of soda have a double refractive power, and
 polarize light.    He found that a mass of fluate of lime, having
 a cube in the centre, but surrounded with different facets, pola
 rized light ; but that the light passed through the cubic crystal
 without any chancre.      Muriate of soda, some crystals of which
 measured three inches, gave very fine colours ; blue with comple
 ment of red, red with complement of yellow, &c. This discovery
 not only contributes to confirm the accuracy of crystallography,
 but will also facilitate its progress, as it must tempt many persons
 to direct their attention to a branch of science so fertile, and so
  curious in its phaenomena.

   Mr. Todd, a surgeon in the Royal Navy, presented an account
of his observations made on the torpedo at the Cape of Good
Mope.    The peculiar organs of this animal have been described
by the late Mr. Hunter.    Mr. T. found that when the electric
organs are often excited they lo-,e their power, and the animai
dies much sooner.      Its first strokes are always the most violent,
and gr iw gradually more and more feeble until quite exhausted,
and then the animal dies. The author cut open the little tubes
or electric organs in the breast ; and by this process the animal
lost its electric powers, but continued to live longer than those
whose electricity was entirely exhausted. The torpedos su jected
to these experiments were smaller than those found in the north
ern seas, being only from five to eight inches long, and from
three to five broad.        They were caught by the sailors when
fishing in the usual manner while the Lion lay at anchor off the
 Cape.     Some of the torpedos manifested a kind of reluctance
 to give shocks ; others parted with them very freely : hence the
author is inclined to believe that it requires a considerable effort
in the animal to give shocks, and one which shortens its life.
The torpedos were kept in casks of salt-water, in which they
 lived from two to five days.
    Feb. 21. A short paper by Sir Everard Home was read, con
taining some observations on the structure of the feet of some
lacertae, particularly the gecko.     Sir Joseph Banks, who suffered
nothing to escape his observation, noticed, while in Batavia,
that the gecko is a very familiar inmate of the houses ; and that
it could run along their smooth cielings, having its back down
 wards, with the greatest case, contrary to the laws of gravity.
 He mentioned this circumstance to Sir Everard, and also sup
plied him with a large one weighing three ounces, in order that
he might examine the structure of its feet.           The result of his
inquiry       is,
              that the feet  of the  gecko  have  some  resemblance to
 the  actinia of those fish which   adhere  to the sides of ships that

In     our xivth volume we inserted a copy of the zodiac found in the            .
portico of this temple, accompanied with a dissertation thereon
by the now deceased Dr. Henley.                 The object of the author was,
in opposition to the French sceptics, who affected to draw from
 the structure of this curious astronomical monument an inference
 that it was at least 17000 years old, to show from evideuce ..fur
 nished by the zodiac itself, that it was not constructed earlier
 than the reign of Augustus.            It would appear that the reasoning
 of Dr. Henley has been considered as conclusive by the learned,
 for we have seen no attempt made to controvert it.
     Our astronomical readers will be gratified by receiving in the
 present number a plate representing a planisphere found in one
 of the apartments of the same temple, most exquisitely engraved
  by Cardon *.
      Our readers will naturally turn to our xivth volume to examine
                                                                       whether

 whether any or what coincidence there may be between this pla
 msphere and the zodiac referred to.          We shall be happy to re
 ceive from any of our correspondents whatever rational conjec
tures may occur to them respecting the planisphere.               To us it
 appears    that  it has reference  to a period  at which   Taurus, Leo,
 Scorpio, and Aquarius, were the cardinal signs; for these signs
 are made to coincide respectively with the four corners of the
 apartment : but this settles nothing as to the time at which it
 was set up.      We shall only throw out the suggestion (which
 rnay yet   be  very foolish), whether something relative to the pre
 cession  of  the equinoxes is not indicated by the Overlapping, as
 it were, cf some of the signs ? We are aware that the duplicates
 of Taurus and of Leo have been considered as extra-zodiacal
 asterisms ; but may they not be intended to mark a difference
 between the moveable and fixed zodiacs? — between the ideal
 zodiac, which astronomers always make to commence with the
vernal equinox, still calling the first 30° Aries, and the stellar
 constellation originally so called ?      If so, Taurus seems to be
marked as the vernal equinox at a period much more ancient
 than the date of the erection of the temple of Dendera; and if
so, by the motion of Taurus in the moveable zodiac, when the
equinox had changed a whole sign the moveable Gemini would
come-to the place of the stationary Taurus, and so of the other
signs, making Aries to become the vernal sign : and by a second
change of a whole sign the moveable Taurus would reach the
Stationary Pisces, bringing the moveable Libra to the stationary
Leo. Is this indicated in the planisphere before us ? If so, the
vernal equinox at the time when this planisphere was put up
appears to have been in the stellar Pisces, which it is now quitting.
The precession of the equinoxes, as it is called, is at the rate of

    " It is said that     Berzelius has made some decisive experi
ments on chlorine, and on the quantity of oxygen which it con
tains.    J   think that after mine his proof was not necessary :
and what in fact «ould we wish for stronger than sweet mercury,
which in 100 of oxidule which it contains, gives four of oxygen
and corrosive sublimate; which on the same quantity of oxide
The zodiac of the portico, and the dissertation of Dr. Henley, of course
were mentioned ; and Mr. Taylor, remarking that the plate of the plani
sphere was so well engraved, that it could bear printing off a sufficient
number for the Philosophical Magazine, as well as for the expensive work
which he is now publishing, added that he should be pleased to see it in the
work in which Dr. Henley's Dissertation had appeared, as it might then
meet the eyes of some who have already paid attention to the subject.

gives eight of oxygen ; and which leave as their residues, the
former a black ponder composed of 14 of dry muriatic acid
and of 82 of reduced mercury ; and the latter a red powder
composed of 20 of dry muriatic acid and 72 of reduced mer
cury ; and all powders of astonishing lightness, of dull instead
of bright colours, which the oxygen regenerates into their primi
tive salts, and from which water takes up the dry acids, the mer
cury remaining reduced ?
    " Berzelius is of mv way of thinking, as to the existence of
oxygen in azote. I have subjoined a note on this subject. I was
the first to, class azote among the combustibles, and the first also
to class it'umong the oxidated bodi'es.        Wherefore all this noise
about a new theory ? — is it not merely putting in a new form
what others have invented ?
    " Prussic acid has been found in opium inGermany ; and from
this discovery it has been concluded that the narcotic virtue of
opium depends on that acid.         You will agree with me, that there
is onlv a step between them.
    " I have found that we may extract the soluble parts of most
organized substances, by treating their powder precisely like
coffee.       But if too much boiling water is poured in, nothing
more of the substance is communicated to it. I made my first
experiment of this kind on gall-nuts in powder, for making ink,
and 1 fnade it with perfect ease. The ink obtained was a true
black, did not become thick, and did not deposit any of its ingre-'
dients ; but we must use the sulphate oxidated, and not that
which, is oxidulated, and put in the gum and sugar- candy last o?
all.

        It is said that Gay-Liissac has published a work on the pruss'a
acid, and that he has found, like me, that this acid is azoto-
carbonated hydrogen.           I have said, in my translation of Bu-
cholz and of Daw, that this acid is similar to the hydrothionic
acid, or sulphuretted hydrogen.          The hydrogens proper to the
two combustibles,         and those which constitute them, azeW
in the state of ammonia, and sulphur in the state of hydro -
genated sulphur, are taken up by the third hydrogen, and the:
dry acids are exposed.          The hydrogens may by heat he taken
from the double radical of the prussic acid, without the elements
of this radical being separated ; and I am led to think that they
are united in the same manner as carbon is with sulphur in the
alcohol of Lampadius ; i.e. the combustible which is found in the
 highest ratio is substituted for the oxygen of the dry acid of the
other combustible, this oxygen being proportioned to the water.
In the combination the carbon or the azote is in a reduced state,
and they are also subsaturated with the quantity of hydrogen
which serves to compose their oxygen into water.              This ex
                                                                  plains

plains the reason why the oxygen alone does not decompose the
 alcohol of Lainpadius into acids of its two combustibles ; and
also shows why the water resolves them into sulphur, and into
regenerated carbon.      It ought to be the same with the radical
«f the prussie acid.
    " It seems to result from some first experiments of Vauquelin
on the hyperoxygenated muriatip acid, that the dry muriatic acid
may be saturated with oxygen at least in three ratios.

                            M.   Fan Mons.
    il M. Berzelius no longer considers azote     as the radical  ele
mentary combustible of the nitric acid.         He thinks that this
acid is composed of 8S, 29 parts of oxygen, and 11,72 parts of
ap unknown radical, which he calls nitria.
    " As in 100 parts of nitric acid we find 26,425 of azote only,
and 73,575 of oxygen, and as there ought to be 88,29 parts, the
24,715 parts of oxygen wanting must be contained in the 26,425
parts of azote; and this azote ought consequently to be com
posed of 24,715 of oxygen, , and 11,72 of the unknown radical
which the author calls nitric.
    "  According to this, 100 parts of azote consist of 44,32 of ni-
fria, and 55,68 of oxygen.      The hydrogen acted in these experi
ments as an elementary body, or at least as a combustible exempt
from oxygen.
    " If we are to consider hydrogen as an elementary substance,
and azote, on the contrary, as an oxide, then ammonia must
necessarily lmve for its principles, nitria, hydrogen, and oxygen.
We may always regard it as the oxide of a compound radical.
We may figure to ourselves that it consists, according to given
volumes, of one proportion of nitria and six proportions of hy
drogen : — ammonia, on the contrary, consists of one proportion
of nitric, One proportion of oxygsn, and six proportions of hy
drogen.

      Berzelius also thinks that the amalgam obtained from the
reduction of ammonia contains a peculiar metal.               This metal,
he observes, cannot be a simple body, since the radical of the
ammonia is compound."
   M. Freysmuth has discovered columbium in Bohemia.                   He
extracted it from a mineral which had been hitherto regarded as
a native sulphuret of zinc, and also for nigrin, which it resem
bles.    The author thinks that tantalium and columbium are
very   different  metals, notwithstanding the resemblances which
Wollaston found between them.            M. Jacquin has in his posses
sion a piece of columbium extracted from this ore.
   M. Michellotti     has dissolved silver in the simple muriatic acid
at a  boiling   heat,  and obtained a crystallizable salt soluble in
water and in alcohol, and which is sublimated after the manner
of the muriates called the lulyraceous muriates.             This gentle
man thinks that it is a hydrochloride-oxide, the muriate less
precipitated being an oxidule.         The water is divided more or
into a portion with excess of acid, and into a portion with ex
cess of oxide.

    Sir, — The    following particulars relative to ihe late intense
cold may be worth recording in your Magazine. On the morn
ing of the 7th of February the cold very much increased, and in
the night was very severe ; the thermometer being about ten
degrees of Fahrenheit.         On the Sth it scarcely rose above that
degree all day, and at midnight was 6° ; at three o'clock in the
morning of the 9th, 5°; and at sunrise, 4°.          In other parts of
the parish of Hackney it is said to have been two degrees lower.
At Walthamstow, about three the same morning, it was \\°.
The same night it was about 2 \° at Clapton. On the 10th it
rose several degrees, and the ordinary cold of winter returned.
Nothing remarkabie either in the height or variation of the ba
rometer, or of any other metereological instrument, occurred ;
the skv was, during the cold, almost entirely free from clouds.

XXXV. On        a correct practical Method            for   cutting Spherical
   Brick Niches — On the Spiral Line — and On Spandrel Groins.
   By Mr. Richard Brown, of Wells -Street, Oxford-Road.
                    I. On Spherical Brick Niches.
From     my never having seen in any publication hitherto, a
correct  practical method for cutting spherical brick niches (a
thing so essential) I was induced to send for insertion in your use
ful Magazine the accompanying plate.       It contains an accurate
drawing of the moulds and templets as used for gauging the
bricks in the head of the niches recently executed in the north
flank of Drury Lane Theatre : therefore these lines may safely be
depended on when applied to all such future works.
                      I am, sir,
                                 Yours respectfully,

   First describe the curvature of the plan with the radii st, sv,
then mark the bricks on         beginning at the front with
                               it,                               header

being now laid down, next project the orthographical elevation gg
from the plan, and from thence proceed with the divisions of the
bricks round the head of the niche, observing that the joints must
always be so arranged as to have          brick fall directly over the

The bricks are next radiated to the centre of the niche, and the
heading joints described concentric to each other, which com
pletes the construction of the niche.        Next for the moulds —       :
First form the centring, as shown            by

describe the plan of the niche on which are shown the ichnogra-
phical appearance of the centring and some of the radiating lines
of the brick-work. These lines, which are to be the guide in
laying the bricks on the centring, are projected ichnographically
on the centring, in the following manner           First, describe the

bp.  drawn up to the line 5 m, and from thence described round
to the radial lines 4, 3.        If these lines are now brought down:
to intersect the panillel lines on the ichnography, the intersec
tions will then give the points through' which the curves must
 pass, as seen described on the centring.            These lines being now
shown ichnographically on the centring, it is next required to
 make a mould for drawing thein mechanically on the centring,
 and for gauging the edge of the templet c,c,c,i: this is done
 most expeditiously (and sufficiently accurate lor the workman)
 in the following manner: Take the four numerical divisions
<U+2666>from the plan and set them on the line 1 2 3 4 at fig. B ;
  these lines then draw parallel to qq, and bring up from the
 plan of the centring the corresponding lines ee, &c. and where
  they intersect the parallel lines 1 23 4 will be the extreme
 edge of the mould.           The other edge of the mould is found
                                      J
 by merely transferring the distances on the opposite side of
  the centre line.      The rule        shows a mechanical method, as
 used by some workmen for striking the joints on the centring ;
 but as it is liable to variation, I shall merely explain it: A rule
  is first fixed at the centre /, and in the direction of any joint
  divided round the arch ; a string is then fixed at the back of
  the centring opposite         and the other end of the string brought
   to the upper edge of the rule, and from that slided gradually
  down on the centring in the direction of the rule.            The joint  is.
  then marked      by the line with    a  pencil.
      I    now proceed with the moulds and templets for gau
   ging and rubbing the bricks by; dddd represents the ground
   (glued up like  a  piece of dado) to which the inclined wedge-like
   mould ccc  is  fixed.     This mould requires to he very accurately
   made, as   it   becomes     the regulating mould of all the bricks
   throughout the niche, and to which the bricks are fitted; aa
   shows the sec! ion of the hither end of the mould, which ends
   imperceptibly in     a thin edge at     i,likewise inclining to p, where
 it   will also fall to      point: the edge cc-c also curving round
                             a
   agreeably to the mould wx shown above, and swelled                by  the
   mould, fig. B, being bent round it. The mould aa, observe,
   must be the exact thickness of one of the bricks taken from the
   elevation, as g,      for instance
                        o,                ;but here the mould is   shown as
 if   the bricks  were   six  times   as  large.    This
                                                       is   to makeit  more
   evident.

   next mark the divisions of the bricks round the edge of the
   mould ccc, likewise on the grounds, which divisions draw to
   wards p   by means of        rule.
                                 a       This will now give the mould for
   the thickness, inclination and joint, of every required brick, and
                                                                        UUl,

niche, the core excepted.— ,-The moulds          fig. C, give the
bevel, curvature, and convexity of the bricks in the core of the
niche, which core is generally composed of about two bricks,
(but sometimes of stone) and is always introduced on account
of the bricks becoming so very thin at the back. Thus is the
whole sufficiently and practically explained.
                       II.      On the Spiral    Line'
   The construction of the screw round the cylinder (which is
performed by a wedge bent round it), and the evolution of the
spiral line from the cone, not being generally understood among
mechanics,   1   have been induced to lay before your readers the
following simple illustrative diagrams.
   Fig- 11 represents an orthographical cylinder,    and the semi
circle 123 4. half its plan or circumference : this cylinder we will
suppose is required to be cut into a screw. To do this, the num
ber of revolutions or threads tobe-cut must first be determined:
if there he four, five, or more worms, it will then require less
power to tui n tiie screw than if it were less vermiculated : here the
screw has only two revolutions. To construct them, first draw the
line a S, at right angles to the cylinder, on which line set twice
the circumference as shown by the figures 1 2 3 4, 8 I 23 4,&c.
next erect the line 8, p, perpendicular to the base line 8, and
place the height of the cylinder thereon : then from p produce a
line to a; this will now represent the surface of the wedge, which
wedge is to be represented as furled round the cylinder in the
following manner.       First, draw the lines 1234, &c. perpen
dicularly up the surface of the cylinder, and on the wedge; next
produce parallel lines from the inclined points hhh, and perpen
dicular to Sp, until they cross the cylinder: the points of in
tersection on the surface will then he the points through which
the curve or thread must pass: this is the construction and a
development of the screw.      For the spiral line, first form a cone,
as at fig. L, of the same height and diameter at the base as the
cylinder; then set one leg of the compasses at the apex of the
cone /, extending the other leg to r, and with the radius t,r,
describe the curve r 8 ; on this curve set sixteen divisions,
four being equal to the circumference of the base of the cone,
 and the sixteen equal to two revolutions round its base : next
 converge these lines towards t : this being done, take from the
 wedge of the cylinder the length of the lines 4         //,
                                                           4&c. and set
                                                               k,

 set the compasses on       /, and revolve the lines 1 1, &c. to come
 in contact with the cone : these lines then draw parallel to the
 hase of the cone; and where they intersect the inclined lines on
 the conic surface will be the undulating or serpentine line; the
 spiral one will now be seen to a demonstration by the diagram
 fig. O above, which diagram is formed by the revolutions
 round the respective points brought up from the cone below
 Figs. DEFG show the conic sections by a very simple method,
 which is new*, i, i, for example, shows the cone. Now sup
 pose the line tt to be the section-line for the hyperbola, (a
 section perpendicular to the hase of the cone,) take the distance
 t u at the base, and set it to h, b, on each side of the line h;
 next set the compasses on the cone at O, and revolve round the
 dotted lines c c ; then take the measures t r r, and set them on
 each side the line h : these lines draw perpendicular to b b, and
produce the parallel lines t p, &c. then at the intersections of
these perpendicular lines with the horizontal ones will be points
through which to describe the hyperbola.                 For the parabola
 (a   section cut parallel   to  the side  of the cone)  take the distances
 1 2 3 at fig. I), and        set them up the line 12 3 fig. F ; these
lines draw parallel to dd; then from the cone D take the
measures e c,e c, and set them on each side the line k at fig. F,
which lines draw perpendicular to dd, and the intersections with
the parallel lines will give the points through which to describe
the parabola.
     For the ellipsis (a section cut obliquely through the cone), find
the centre of the section-line marked 1,2, at fig. D, and from
the apex of the cone draw a dotted line to the base through 1 ;
then with the centre n revolve round the dotted line to x.              The
dotted line a is also produced at right angles to the dotted line
i, «, proceeding from the apex of the cone; next draw the line
1 ,m at right angles to the section line 1, 2, and revolve the dotted
line ia round to m; then will the line \,m be the minor, and
the line i, 2 the major diameters of the ellipsis ; to describe
which, take the two diameters and place them at fig. G, then
form the figure as there shown : this is plain to inspection.
                        III.   On Spandrel Groins.
     I have also sent for insertion in your next number,           a draw
ing of the new and more effectual method of building groined
    * The sections of the
                           Scalene Cone   I have shown in my Treatise on the
Practical Principles of Perspective.
                                                                     arches

                          On Spandrel Groins.                      1 65
 arches in brick-work, than the common one generally adopted
  (termed spandrel groins), with the centring and moulds laid
 down as used for executing the same.         These kinds of groined
 arches are better adapted for subterraneous structures, and better
 answer the purpose for large warehouses where immense weights
 or burthens are required above them, than the common method
 of vaulting, they being less liable to fracture at the groined angles
 by any extraordinary impulse operating on the crown of the
 arch. This system of vaulting, I believe, has not yet been pub
 lished in any work. As far as I can learn, they were first executed
 by Mr. Alexander, architect, at the London Docks ; and recently
by Mr. Laing, architect, at the new Custom -House.
     BB represents the ichnography of the caps of the piers with
the abutments of the arches, as shown at RR. Fig. P. repre
sents the scenographic view of the groined vault as executed ;
xxx the elevation of one of the centres made of two-inch
deal board rising circularly six feet, which is one-third the
span; the whole opening being 18 feet. rt, rt, &c. represent
the angle rib of the same thickness traced from A 6, fi5, &c;
mm shows the plan of the ribs, which are two feet apart ; nn a
square centring box ; and uau the ichnography of the boarding
 on the centring.     These boards are each 1       \  inch thick : at
 the London Docks 1| inch boards were used, the arches there
 being one brick and half thick.         Fig. R shows the mould by
 which to cut or form the ends of the boards to the centring.
 This mould is made in the following manner : Take the hither-
most divisions 1 2 .3 4 5 6, at z, and set them on the line
  1 23456,    at fig. R; these lines draw parallel and at right
angles   to the line 1,6 ; next take the divisions at the plan hn,
hn, &c. and transfer them to 6 p, 5 p, &c. and the intersections
will give the mould sought for.      To find the mould fig. T, for
the spandrel of the groin, first draw the lines a a, &c. at right
angles to the centre line a a ; then take the height h6, h5, &c.
and set them on the lines a c,ac, &c. ; by this means you will
form the angle curvature or middle rib : next take the separate
distances cc, &c. and set them on the line ee, &c. at fig. T.
These lines draw parallel and at right angles to the line ee;
lastly, take the distances an, an, &c. and set them from e to o
(the corresponding divisions) seen at fig. T ; this will now give
the length and bevel of each board round the spandrel, which is
all the moulds required in constructing the centring in this way:
observe the line oo, &c. at fig. T is a straight line: one side of
the bricks in the arch (but not visible in this drawing) has a
concavity on their surface for a key to the mortar j this is formed
by the mould when made.
                                L3                                The

166                      On Spandrel Groins.
    The brick-work for leveling   above the  groinsis grouted  : in some
cases groined vaults contain but a single arch      ; flooring joists are
laid over their tops and filled up between with dry rubbish.            It
is necessary   to  say, the piers of the former   groins  are built  with
Aberdeen and the caps with Dundee granite, it being found the
hardest and best calculated for this purpose : observe, the joints
of the stones must be left open round the piers until the groined
arches are well settled, otherwise the stones at the joints will
flush or chip off;   This has been found to be the case in practice.
     The drawing in outline marked fig. S shows a better and
more advisable method of centring these groins, where consider
able labour and wood may be saved.          For example, PP, &c. are
piers of the groins, LLL ledgers of deal quartering running hori
zontally along each bay, and supported on shores; rcc, &c.
plans of the centres, as ranged and fixed on the ledgers : each
bay or passage being centred in this manner; next board them
over, forming them into a semicylinder, as a common vault or
area.    This being done, next get out a mould for marking the
pommon intersections of the cross arches : to do this, take
the divisions 0123-1, and set them on the line. 01 234 at
fig. M ; these lines draw parallel to each other and at right an
gles to the perpendicular line 04.       Next take the distances ab,
a b, &c. and transfer them to 4 n, 3 w, &c. this will then give
the curvature of the mould, and which mould is seen further
 applied on the ichnography of the centring.          Jack ribs, as r r,
&e. are next to be regularly fixed on the cylinder, and boarded
over, making the whole pf the centring by this means appear
 as the centring of a common equal pitch cylindric groin.             To
form the spandrels of the groins, first take the divisions //,&c.
 and transfer them to the line A A, &c. at fig. N ; next take the
measures ed, ed, &c. and transfer them to k i, k i, &c. at fig. N :
this will then give the mould whereby to mark out the spandrels
on the centring, and which mould is seen applied thereon. Lastlv,
bridging pieces, as shown at gg, &c. are to be fixed across the
angles and boarded, which form the spandrels and complete the
pentring for receiving the brick-work.         Thus is the whole suf
ficiently and practically explained.

XXXVL           Answer to Remarks on Mr. Donovan's " Reflections
               on the Inadequacy of electrical Hypotheses."
                                 To    Mr. Tilloch.
            With         regard to the remarks contained in your Maga
zine for December last, upon my " Reflections on the Inadequacy
of electrical Hypotheses," I beg leave to offer a few observa
tions.
    Amongst a variety of statements rather unusual in philosophi
cal controversy, it is there mentioned that I observed but half
of the necessary phenomena, that it was the wrong half, &c. ;
that I passed my errors through the Kirwanian Society, and the
Royal Irish Academy, and in the latter case so successfully as to
obtain the prize from that, learned body.               It was principally on
these accounts that the author of the remarks undertook to de
tect my errors, which, as lie chooses to assert, had thus received
the assent of two literary institutions.             Half at least of this task
was unnecessary: the paper in question never was read in the
Academy, and never obtained the prize.                     The essay which
really   did   obtain     the  prize   I sent  in  December    1813, and was
on a very different subject ; the essay on electricity was read in
the Kirwanian Society nearly two years before*.                  The inaccu
racy of the above-mentioned statement is therefore surprising ;
 and the more so, when it is considered with what caution and
deference a learned body of men (including many fellows of the
 university, and most of the literary characters of the country,)
 should be treated by an unknown individual.               This much I felt it
 my duty to say with regard to the Academy; and but for this, I
should have been disinclined to occupy the pages of your Maga
zine, or obtrude myself on the notice of its readers, concerning
 a trifling question at issue merelv as to facts.
     Extensive reading would have shown that the electrical states
attributed in my " .Reflections" to the Ley den phial had not
been noticed by me alone. Experimenters of great reputation had
observed analogous facts, and of this a perusal of the works of
 Wilson, Eeles,ofthe Encyclopedia- Britannica (art. Electricity),
and of various other authorities that I now forget, will afford am
 ple testimony} so that the correctness of my experiments stands
 supported by the concurrence of persons of high reputation. The
 question does not relate merely to the states of the phial, but
 comprises the whole doctrine of plus and minus: they are inse-
    *
       This is distinctly  noted  in the abstracts of the Kirwanian  Society. —

 168               Some Meteorological Observations
 parably connected ; and as the hypothesis stands, one part can
 not be maintained without contradicting the other. Why, there
 fore, should so limited a survey of those objections be taken,
 which are all in harmony ; and why need one part of the hypo
 thesis be sustained when it is opposed by the other ?
    In my " Reflections, &c." I gave a caution concerning the
 experiments there detailed.        They are of a delicate kind, and
 I stated that they only succeed in certain states of the weather.
 The period when I made them was dry sunny weather, and I
have never found them to succeed easily but in the middle of
 summer.       This is a source of fallacy, which from the season could
 not have been guarded against in the counter-experiments.
    There are various other sources of error.         Thus it is very dif
ficult to determine what body is positive or what negative ; for
positive bodies will, under certain circumstances, attract positive
bodies ; and negative bodies will attract negative.          Of this also
no notice has been taken.
    The electrometer of Bennet is an instrument not to be de
pended on without acquaintance with a principle of electricity
which 1 have developed, and which in a work soon to appear
will be shown to have misled many able investigators.                Any
electrometer on the same principle, whether pith -balls or gold-
leaf, is liable to the same objection.       In the counter-experiments
this error has not been guarded against.
    To the sarcasm and wit affected in the paper alluded to, 1 an
swer "but with silence.       I conceive them below the dignity of
philosophy, and have seldom seen them employed but in the ab
sence of sounder arguments.          The attempt evident throughout
the whole, of making my humble labours appear nugatory, and
myself little better than an idiot, produces no other effect than
to compel me to decline further controversy, and to recommend
more temperate and cautious investigation of the opinions of
others.

XXXVII.        Some Meteorological Observations made in the Ne-r
            therlands,    By M. Van Mons, of Brussels *.
Wb       have this last year remarked a singular opposition be
tween the usual meteorological indications and the weather.
                     * Communicated     by tlie Author.
                                                                     The

                       made in the Netherlands.
The air scarcely ever became dry without the barometer de
scending instead of rising with the storm, and the lowering instead
of the rising of the thermometer most frequently preceded the
rain. The rapid risings and fallings of the barometer were fol
lowed by weather more or less fine, and it rained at an elevation
above the " very fine weather" while it was dry with a lowering
below the stormy point ; and the hygrometer, like the manome
ter, harmonized with the reversed indications of the other instru
ments
   Winter opened with a frost of 1 1° df Reaumur the first day:
this extraordinary cold will break the elasticity of the air, and
a long thaw with continual rains will be the consequence of it:
this thaw is besides indicated by all the habitudes of animals and
plants : all the larvae are found at the surface of the ground, and
the- roots of plants have risen : no retreat of any insect is deep,
and they are rather put out of the reach of the rain than of the
frost.   Astronomical appearances indicate the same thing, and
augur a humid and warm season from beginning to end.           Acute
rheumatisms (but as yet there is no intermittent-fever) prognos
ticate the approaching humidity of the season.      There have been
scarcely any   but  north  winds  during  the whole  year, and these
have lasted whole weeks at a time.            The wild or mountain
plants have uniformly overtopped those sown, and the harvests
have thereby suffered much.          The fruits of autumn are still
 (February) green, and the fruits of winter, and even of spring,
are eatable.
    The extraordinary temperatures of the season, either of heat
or cold, have not as usual been followed by extraordinary op
posite temperatures.      The barometer rising with the stationary
thermometer has not once indicated fine weather, and in ge
neral the motions of the thermometer do not seem to have been
influenced by the inverse movements of the barometer.         Never
theless the fine and prolonged rains, which I call the rebounding
rains (pluies de retente) have most frequently been the precursors
of dry weather.      The decrements of the moons have almost re
stored calmness to the air.      I saw during the serene weather of
September the thermometer ascend and the barometer descend
at 11 o'clock at night; and when I rose, both instruments had
returned to their station by day.        At 3 o'clock no movement
 was remarked, and during the whole month the barometer was
very changeable, although the manometer was stationary, and.
during the whole year the needle of this instrument, at other
times so true, marked falsely.       This proves that the air presses
more by its elasticity than by its weigh't; and the winds, contrary
to custom, seemed to be the cause instead of the effect of the
 changes ; — I say seemed to le, because it is never so in fact.

I/O               Sequel to the melancholy               Catastrophe
The briskness of the fires has rarelv indicated that the oxygen in
the air was owing rather to vapour than to an azotic compound.
The influence which propagates frost acts from south to north :
this alone accounts for it3 short duration.  It is at the points of
passage of a line which from the ruling star stretches to the
centre of the earth, that remarkable changes are successively
manifested : a similar re-action, at least a regular one, has not
been observed this year.      The revolutions in the body of the
sun, the eruption of several volcanoes in this body, the short
duration of its revolution on its axis, &c. which have been per
ceived at the Milan observatory — could all these have in
fluenced the variations detailed ?— Time will show.

Sir, —   In     your number for last June, you did me the favour
'to print the narrative    Itransmitted of the inundation at Heaton
 Colliery, by  which accident thirty-three men and forty-two bovs
were either drowned or irrecoverably inclosed in the higher re
 cesses of thp mine.     The steam-engines having at length drawn
out the water,    I am enabled to communicate the sequel to this
 tragedv.    On the 6th of January the first body was found      was            :   it
that of an old man employed on the waggon- way             and a fact  ;
worthy of notice is, that the waste water in which he had been
 immersed had destroyed the woollen clothes and corroded the
 iron parts of   a knife the deceased had        his pocket
                                                          in  yet his       ;
 linen and the bone haft of the knife remained entire         Shortly
 after Mr. Miller, the under viewer, the wasteman, and            few               a
 others were discovered .they had met
                               :                similar fate, having
                                                          a
 been overtaken       by
                       the water about      hundred vards from the
                                                     a
shaft  to  which  they  had  been hastening to save themselves. But
 the lot of these eight persons may be considered fortunate        for              ;
 their sufferings were transient when compared with those which
 awaited the unhappy beings left at work towards ,thc rise of the
                                                                                    Kline,

                          at Heaton Colliery.                     m
 mine, and as yet unconscious of their dreadful situation.      About
 the 16th of February the higher part of the workings was ex
 plored, — and now a scene truly horrible was presented to view;
for here lav the corpses of fifty-six human beings, whom the
water had never reached, being situated thirty-five fathoms above
its level. They had collected together near the crane, and were
found within a space of thirty yards of each other.      Their posi
tions and" attitudes were various ; — several appeared to have
fallen forwards from off an inequality, or rather step in the coal
on which they had been sitting — others, from their hands being
clasped together, seemed to have expired while addressing them
selves to the protection of the Deity — two, who were recognised
as brothers, had died in the act of taking a last farewell, by
grasping each other's hand, — and one poor little boy reposed
 in his father's arms. Two slight cabins had been hastily con
structed bv nailing up deal boards, and in one of these melan
choly habitations three of the stoutest miners had breathed their
last: and what seems singular, one of them had either been
 stripped of his clothes by his surviving companions, or had
 thrown off all covering from mental derangement.             A large
 lump   of horse  flesh wrapped up  in a jacket, nearly two    pounds
 of candles, and three others which had died out when half-
 burned, were found in this apartment, if it can be so called.
 One man, well known to have possessed a remarkably pacific
disposition, had retired to a distance to end his days alone and
 in quiet ; and that this would be the case was predicted by
many of his fellow-workmen who were acquainted with his mild
 temper.    Another had been placed to watch the rise and fall
of the water, to ascertain which sticks had been placed, and was
 found dead at his post.
    There were two horses in the part of the mine to which the
people had retired.      One had been slaughtered, its entrails taken
 out, and hind quarters cut up for use ; the other was fastened to
a stake, which it had almost gnawed to pieces, as well as a corf
 or coal basket that had been left within its reach.
    An important question must now occur to every friend of
humanity.      For how long a time did these ill-fated people exist
 in their horrible abode ? Unfortunately, to this inquiry no pre
 cise answer can be given ; but that they perished for want of
 respirable air, and not from hunger and thirst, is certain ; for
 most of the flesh cut from the horse, together with a consider
 able quantity of horse beans, was unconsumed, and a spring of
 good water issued into this part of the colliery: besides, the un-
 bnrned remains of candles afford evidence of a still stronger,
 nature : — and by these data the coroner's jury was enabled to

   172 Sequel to the melancholy Catastrophe at Heaton Colliery.
   pronounce     a verdict accordingly.      The overman had left the
   chalk-board on which it is usual to take down an account of         1
  the work done, together with his pocket book, in an empty corf.
   On these some memoranda might have been expected to be
  noted ; but no writing subsequent to the catastrophe appeared
  on either.     Two of the men's watches had stopped at four
            —
  o'clock ; this period of time might be somewhat more than
  twenty-four hours after descending into the mine: but it is also
  probable they may have wound up their watches after the acci-"
  dent had taken place ; and notwithstanding various reports, I do
  not believe that any document was discovered to throw light on
  this lamentable part of the subject.
      On referring to my former letter, it may be seen that the owners
  of Heaton mine opened the shaft of an ancient collierv situated
  about 300 yards from the place where the pitmen were known
 to be at work; but, owing to innumerable falls from the roof, and
  the prevalence of carbonic acid gas and carburetted hydrogen
 gas, were prevented from penetrating further than 80 yards into
 the waste.      On a Wednesday morning the accident happened^
 and by the following Saturday the scaffold which closed the old
 pit was reached and removed. By these means it is thought by
 some professional men that the pure air, already much reduced
 by respiration and combustion, would be let out through the
 broken coal, and that this would be the utmost possible period
 of these miserable sufferers' existence.       Though it must fre
 quently have fallen to the lot of miners to have been entombed
 alive in the prosecution of their hazardous avocations, yet I know
 of but tivo of thes-e occurrences upon record. The first was
 published by Dr. Percival in the Memoirs of the Philosophical
 Society at Manchester for 1785.         A pitman, whose name was
Travas, had the misfortune to be shut up in a mine at Ashby-
under-Line, owing to a quantity of earth bursting into the shaft,
which was 90 yards deep. Here he remained inclosed in a ca
vity three yards in length by two in breadth — in a seam only
two feet thick, without either water or food, and where the can
dles of the workmen who dug him out would not burn — for the
space of seven days and nights, — and though perfectly sensible
when found, he died in a few hours after.
    The other occurrence took place at Beaujoc, in the vicinity of
Liege, in 1812, and was detailed in a pamphlet by Baron De
Micoud.      It nearly resembled the Heaton inundation, except
that the water rushed from an upper seam of coal, and not from
a waste situated to the rise.     This colliery is 186 yards in depth,
and its seam .'35 !- inches thick : — here seventy men and boys were
shut up without food or wholesome water, and where their can-
       '

 nights ;  but were   at length fortunatelv extricated by a drift be
 ing driven from an adjoining mine.          In this c;ise I am led to
think the quantity of deleterious gas had been less considerable
than at Heaton.
    I have now only to remark, that the bodies of those men which
had laid in wet places were much decaved ; but where the floor
was dry, though their flesh had become shrivelled, they were all
easily recognised by their features being entire.

XXXIX.      Some Account of certam Agates-presenting ly an arti
   ficial Arrangement      the Aspect of organized Bodies.         By
    M\ Gillet de Laument, Engineer to the Mines of France*.
M     . Moreau de St. MerYj having brought from Italy some
agates found in the bed of the Trebia, which discharges itself
into the Po near Plaisance, sent a polished one to M. de Mont-
egre^ who showed it to me at the Institute on the 9th of Oct.
1815.
    I immediately observed that the appearance of the organized
body which this agate presented seemed to have been given it by
art. We showed it afterwards to several naturalists, who at the first
glance thought they saw in it the marks of the wood of the palm-
tree; while others thought they saw the traces of a marine body.
In fact, this agate presents in the middle some round conical
bodies penetrating into the stone, the summits of which are
at the surface, and the united bases of which form an appear
ance of a network with hexahedral meshes : in other parts of
the stone we find only small insulated cones with circular bases.
    Having for a long time remarked, the fractures which the
blows of a hammer produced on hard and homogeneous stones,
I had ascertained that under the place where the blow was
given cones were formed, the summit of which was at the point
of, contact, and of which the base was sunk more or less re
gularly into the stone ; and I had thus formed with fine free
stone the lustrous freestone of Haiiy.          According to this ob
servation, I think I may venture to say, that the appearances of
organized bodies in the agate in question had been formed by
blows adroitly given and struck in succession beside each other.
                     * Communicated
                                      by the Author.
                                                                I even

174        Account        of an Aerolite which fell in Moravia.
I even made the attempt myself, and I thus obtained agates
furnished with cones presenting the aspect of organized bodies.
   The agate from Italv seems to have been polished after the
blow, which has removed the summits of several tones from the
middle of the stone, and has given them a strange appearance.
In this agate and in mine, small circles are seen with the mi
croscope at the places where the blows have been given ; on
wetting, both the cones partly disappear on account of the liquid
penetrating the fissures, but on drying all these cones re-appear.
The Marquis de Dree has in his fine-collection an agate set in
a ring, which he showed me latelv, and which has cones thai
must have had the same origin.
   The object of this observation is to inform amateurs that
foreign dealers know how to produce in certain agates very
pretty effects, by an artificial arrangement, which they frequently
give out to be natural, having effected it so as completely to
deceive the rye.

with carbon (steel), and the white parts iron. It seems pro

soft.    M. Schreibers regards this arrangement as peculiar to all
the native iron which has fallen from the atmosphere.

black and white specks became very visible ; but in this speci

rendered it cellular, the black and white marks have followed
the contours of the cavities, and are very remarkable.

                           To  Mr. Tilloch.                             v
 Sir, —    In   your Magazine of January last appeared another
 paper from your correspondent G. S., who, though he apologizes           '
 for a small mistake committed in his first, has now strayed so
 far from propriety, that it will, perhaps, cost him more trouble
 to extricate himself, than it has to attain that state into which
 his last has hurried him.
     You will observe a passage (page 35) with which he begins:
 " In support of H.'s assertion, that metallic    salts are super-salts
  with excess of oxide—-"      This assertion he presses on me : but
 the evidence of some of your former numbers, in which my papers
  are inserted, cannot fail to convince your readers, that if this is
  also a misconstruction   of your correspondent's, it must equally
  display his ignorance of the science of chemistry, and of the sub
  stance of my former papers j or should it not be as I have re
 presented, finding that his arguments were in some measure
  weakened by my last, he wishes to introduce this new assertion
  on my part, so that it may accord more agreeably with his
  wiib.es, and enable him to bear down with redoubled violence
  on my tortured opinion ; thus making a poor endeavour to take
  by this stratagem that which he could not force by truth.
      Now do I consequently lay open for him to commence an at
  tack on that opinion which 1 set forth, against which he may
  probably have as much to say, as against that which he has al
  ready framed for me.
      With this i conclude, that as it is impossible for the most able
   ehemist to cope with one who is regardless of that on which he
                                                               pretends

pretends to argue, I feel myself completely justified in relin
quishing the present controversy : it would indeed be litigious
in the extreme for me to continue to oppose one who writes
not against me, but against the new system (that metallic salt*
are super-salts with excess of oxide) of which your correspon
dent G. S. is the author.

     XLI.   On Fulminating    Gold.      By   J. B. Van Mons, of
                              Brussels*.
There      is a preparation of gold which presents much interest,
and on which the nephew of the illustrious Driessen has published
a very good essay: — I mean fulminating gold.         This compound
may be procured by all the methods of putting ammonia in re
action on dissolved gold ; by aqua regia, with which we precipi
tate gold by the help of a soluble oxide, and by the muriate of
gold which we decompose by means of ammonia ; by the oxide,
of gold which we treat with ammonia, either gaseous or liquid
or with any ammoniacal salt; and finally, by this same oxide,
which we must keep some time in . a dark and damp place
where the air is stagnant.     I prepare it with most advantage by
precipitating by potash    a  diluted   solution of muriate of gold
and muriate of ammonia.       The precipitate is at first muriate of
ammonia and gold; but the instant the ammonia becomes free,
it is aurate of ammonia, called ammonium of gold, or fulminating
gold, which is produced.
    Fulminating gold is not decomposed by any acid, and it is not
by the alkalies : nevertheless the first of these bodies disunite
it by the adjunction of a hyperoxygenated muriate and liquid
chlorine ; without this adjunction, but with the assistance of
heat, double muriate being produced.           This happens from the
combustibles having     more energy   than   its metal.   This com
pound is a salt in which the oxide of gold performs the functions
of acid, and the ammonia the function of an oxide : it is there
fore, as I have already said, an aurate of ammonia, which exists
bv an engagement the more intimate as the oxygen of the gold,
with which the oxygen of the ammonia is proportioned, presents
more caloric to displace.    The acids, in order to decompose this
salt, ought either to take the ammonia from it or dissolve at
once its two elements ; but for the first effect it is necessary
that   the oxide of gold should be insulated from the oxygen
wanting caloric, and for the second effect it would be necessary

                                                                 that

                        On Fulminating Gold.                         177
tliftt the acids should be able to dissolve oxide    of this same qua
 lity, both which    are absolutely impossibilities : and    if such ef
 fects could be obtained, they would multiply ad infinitum the
number of oxides, salts, and all other bodies having oxygen in
combination.
    Nevertheless fire and time, by adding       caloric  to the oxygen
 of the gold, determine the disengagement of the principles of
the fulminating gold and their being taken in solution : energetic
combustibles take from the gold the oxygen, with its defect of
caloric, reduce its metal, and set the ammouia at liberty: which
 explains how, in a globe of fire strongly heated, the fulminating
gold is decomposed without fulminating ; which certainly would
not happen if the ball were platina, gold, or silver.
    Ammonia has too little affinity with water to enable that
liquid aided by heat to take it from the gold : nevertheless
the heat in this case brings together the active principles of the
compound ; and this happens when we wash it with very hot
water: the caloric displaces in the first place the ammonia from,
 the oxide, the hydrogen from the azote, and the oxygen from
 the gold, and pressure disunites them by forming water.            Ful
 minating gold does not detonate under water, for want of power
 to take the temperature requisite for this effect ; and at a heat
 a little higher it resolves into its nearest principles, with the
 single exception of the case in which it has been washed too
 hot.
    Carbon organized and hydrogenated in the oils with ether and
alcohol, as well as azote hydrogenated in ammonia, take up the
oxide of gold from its solvents; which proves that this body acts
more willingly by capacity than by intensity; and the oils may
even decompose the fulminating gold by taking up on one hand
its oxide and on the other hand its ammonia.             The oxide of
gold   which  is separated from  its  solutions by  the  contact  of the
    —
air will it be aurate of organized azote, or oxide rendered inso
luble by hyperoxidation ?      In this last case, as these solutions
are always with an excess of acid, the heating in those of the
muriatic acid must determine the resumption in solution of the
oxide under the formation of oxygenated muriatic acid.
    The sulphuric acid highly concentrated decomposes fulminating
gold by provoking the union between the principles of the water
in order to appropriate to itself this water. The detonating com
pounds, which the same acid decomposes with an explosion, set
the oxygen at liberty.
    The fulminating gold is formed spontaneously in the same
circumstances and by the same causes as the native nitrate of
»ime : it is the organized azote of the .air hydrogenating itself
into an oxidule which produces the first body, and the same

azote sub-hydrogenating     itself into an acid which produces the
second ; and it may be presumed that the two actions take place
simultaneously, or depend upon "ach other.
   Gold in very minute division is dissolved in chlorine by the
help of heat, and also when nitro-muriate of gold is partly de
composed by heat, then treated with muriatic acid, and evapo
rated to dryness.    It is a brown substance, very deliquescent,
which easily decomposes the water of the atmosphere, forming
muriate of gold. I have not as yet examined it with precision.
                    On Silver.      [By the same.]
  It   will not easily be believed,    Brugnatelli observes, that
                                          as
silver, which is a metal reducible per se, may be oxidized in the
air, and at a heat which its oxide scarcely requires in or
der to- be reduced.      There must, therefore, be some other
cause than oxidation which renders silver verifiable : and this
cause will deserve examination.      A very intense heat, or the
electric fluid,— do they organize a portion of the oxygen of the
primitive matter which forms the basis of the silver, in such a
way as to originate an oxide different from the ordinary oxide
of that metal ? This is a difficult question.  Such an effect, by
displacing hydrogen with the oxygen of the primitive matter,
will compose a metal more hydrogenated, and which will be
irreducible in the fire; and the oxidation will take" place not by
the oxygen of the air, but by that which is proper to the primi
tive matter.
   We must inquire if the oxide of silver obtained by fire pos
sesses other qualities than the oxide of the same metal obtained
by the acids ; and in the contrary case, we must ascertain if the
reagents employed in this examination do not separate the super-
combined hydrogen, proportioning at the same time the oxygen
of the caloric to the degree of the new hydrogenation ; or           if,  by
oxidating    the  hydrogen    of  the oxide    at   the   ordinary   degree,
they do not separate some of         it from the water — two circum
stances which will bring silver back to its first constitution.
   We know already that the metals are oxidated            by  the electrie
fluid, as well in vacuo as in contact with the air.               The ex
periments    relative  to  the   bxidation   of  silver  by   caloric  alone
must be undertaken on       a very large   scale  in  close vessels,  on ac
count    of the  volatility of the metal, and in vacuo: we must
particularly ascertain   if  the metal, in returning to its primitive
state, undergoes   a  loss of weight.
    If the fact of the mineral organization of the primitive matter
of metal
  a          by  the electric fluid, or    bya red heat,   is   confirmed  }
we may explain how in aerolites the metals may be artificially
                                                                composed.

composed, and the nature as well as the mode of organization of
the primitive matter of the globe will thereby be elucidated; and
we shall extract oxygen from a substance in which its presence
is least expected.   This fact will, besides, denote that the metals
the oxides of which are reducible by fire, owe this quality to a
smaller dose of oxygen, which is at the same time the cause of
(heir greater weight.
    Juncker had already ascertained that at a very intense heat
silver is converted into a fused oxide ; and Richter mentions the
fact of a considerable quantity of silver which a modern alchemist
had kept in the fire several years, being thereby transformed
into a mass of fused oxide.      M. Richter having obtained this
Miass, tried to reduce      it,
                          first           by
                                   heat and afterwards            by
                                                            the usual
reducers, but he was able to extract only very small portion of
                                                          a
nietal.
   Silver, on being organized,      may also become an acidifiable
combustible   ;for between an oxide and such         body the distance
                                                              a

                               an inverse action, from metals become
acidifiable combustibles, silver may very well, on receiving ca
loric, without losing hydrogen, become         double super-combina

tion of this principle, and constitute either an acidifiable com
bustible or the oxide of a different metal, more energetic, because
it  has more hydrogen, and because with precautions we may ob
tain  it reduced.   This will be the second artificial metal, and
others will soon follow, which, like ammonia, will be decom
posable, because      itwill exist      composition, and in which
                                                by
caloric, favoured      by  disposing affinity, may be substituted for
                            a
the hydrogen of the new metallization, and allow the oxide of
silver to be reduced, per se, into its metal        but hydrogen at
                                                              :               a
lesser heat might also be substituted for the water of the new
metal, and thus present           to us reduced.
                                     it              How can we see
oxide of silver resist reduction in the fire, without making such
a  phaenomenon the subject of the most serious meditation              ?

Sir, —I       feel
                 no inclination to involve Doctor Prichard it?
controversy  but as he has had the advantage of fully stating the
              ;
grounds of his opinions, given in your Magazine, relative to
the Mosaic cosmogony,      will, presume, be allowed me briefly
                                it          I
to examine whether he has succeeded in removing the objections
against them indicated in my former letter.
                                            M   2                            In

135"               On the Cosmogony             of Motet.
   In the paper* which occasioned my observations, Doctor
Prichard, after having, as he imagined, exhibited a complete co--
incidence between the series of facts detailed in the first chap
ter of Genesis and those inferred from geological phenomena,
remarks, that    "ifthis coincidence is surprising in itself, it ap
pears the more so when we compare the cosmogony of the He
brews with the notions on this subject that prevailed among'
other nations of antiquity.     We find invariably that all other
Speculations on thii subject are founded on some fanciful ana
 logy with natural processes that are daily observed."         In his
 recent communication   f, however, our attention    is particularly
directed to, and our surprise excited by,            "
                                                 the remarkable con
nexion discovered between the primitive histories of the most
remote nations on the earth and these documents embodied in
Genesis."    It is added that, not only the Asiatic nations, but the
Runicscalds of Iceland and Scandinavia, and the ancient priests of
Mexico were equally in possession of the primitive traditions ;"
and the latter certainly never obtained them from Jerusalem                            J.
Other similar facts are adduced in support of the opinion that,
the early parts of Genesis are a compilation : but in maintaining
 it,Doctor Prichard does not " place the author of the Penta
teuch in the rank of common compilers of historical fragments
possessed merely of natural intelligence            ;"
                                                  nor does he regard
the supposed materials of the compilation, " in their origin as
common historical testimonies."          On this hypothesis        shall   I
merely  obseve,    that ifin  relating  events   which   no uninspired
person could ever with certainty know, the author of the Pen
tateuch had recourse to records and traditions of whatever cha
racter or antiquity,   itcould only be to supply the want of im
mediate inspiration.        seems, therefore, that to preserve con
                             It
sistency, either the hypothesis or the inspiration of Moses must
be abandoned.
  I  now proceed to the points in discussion.        In my former ob
servations the word day         admitted to have been figuratively
                                   is

timc,    and have occasion to allude to the beginning or end of the
 period designated, we always carry on the metaphor and adopt
 the corresponding terms."       The truth of this position is ob
 vious ; but its application, instead of supporting- the tropical
sense contended for, affords an additional objection against it.
In the day and night of Brama, the duration of the respective
"portions, the preceding and following twilight, the day, and the
 night, are all chronological periods ; and a distinct notion is
conveyed in properly sustained figurative language of the re
 lative time of the exertion of Brama, when it is said, " At the
 close of his night, having long reposed, he wakes, and awaking
 exerts intellect."      Had the morning and the evening been
 thus used in Genesis, to mark precedence or subsequence of dif
 ferent acts of creation in the same day; had it been said, The
-sun was made in the morning, the moon in the evening of the
 -fourth day, the language would with equal propriety have borne
 a literal or figurative interpretation.   But it is remarkable, that
 neither the morning nor the evening is once alluded to for any
  such purpose : the acts of each day are enumerated, and the
  day itself is said to consist of an evening and a morning.     This,
 being so, if day be understood figuratively, there does not ap
 pear to have been the slightest " occasion to allude to the be
  ginning or end of the period designated" by it ; since no other
  Information would be conveyed by the supposed allusions, than
  that an indefinite period was composed of a metaphorical evening
  and morning; or, in other words, that one indefinite period con
  sisted of two indefinite periods.    Ido not, however, pretend to
  appreciate the value of this information, estimated
                                                          " according
  to the genius of Hebrew .literature."
      The other, and more weighty objection, — that it does not ap
  pear that the Hebrew people ever understood the six days of the
  creation as equivalent to so many indefinite periods, — seems im
  plicitly admitted by the remark, that had Moses read zi lecture
  on geology to " the shepherds of Goshen, and told t'hem what
  space of time each oceanic deposit occupied, and by what or
  ganic remains it is to be recognised, he would have spent his
  time to little purpose."    Moses, however, told " the shepherds
  of Goshen" many things quite as difficult to comprehend as that
  each epoch of the creation had occupied an extensive period :
  nor does it seem at all easier to conceive creation the work of
  six days than of as many thousand years. With respect to suc
  cessive oceanic deposits, each characterized by peculiar organic
  remains, no trace of such a series of events is discoverable in the
  Mosaic account.      On the contrary, in that narrative, the waters
  retire previous to the existence of animated beings, and never
 4igain cover the earth until the days of Noah ; and the work
                                   M 3                               of

182       Observations on the late excessive cold' Weather .
of creation is represented as simply progressive, which is littfe
consonant with a series of creations and extinctions of whole
races antecedent to the formation of man.         Could these ap
parently, irreconcilable discordancies be overlooked, still Doctor
Prichard's parallel between the facts detailed in Genesis and
those inferred from geological observation would fail. According
tb the sense in which the twentieth and two following verses of
the first chapter of Genesis have hitherto been generally under
stood, all the inhabitants of the waters were called into existence
on the fifth day ; while geological inference places the orders of
testacea and zoophytes in the third ; that is, in a period when,
according to Moses, nothing animate was created.         It is true,
Doctor Prichard thinks their deficiency in loco-motion sufficient
to exclude them from the fifth day's creation. But besides that
this criticism may be suspected of over-refinement, it is to be
observed that, if they be excluded from that day, it is absolutely
certain that Moses has assigned them no other.        When, there
fore, zoophytes for their analogy to vegetables, and testacea
without participating in that analogy, are removed from the
fifth to the third day, and we are afterwards called upon to
admire the coincidence of the series of the facts detailed in
Genesis with those inferred from geological phenomena, Doctor
Prichard seems to forget that the coincidence is effected by his
placing two orders of animated beings where Moses never placed
them.

                               To   Mr.   Tilloch.
Sir, —    In consequence of the public solicitation of your valua-t
ble correspondent Mr. T. Forster, as well as for the information
of the other readers of your useful Magazine,       am induced to
                                                          I

            Observations on the late excessive cold Weather.      18S
    My    thermometer is graduated according to Fahrenheit's scale,
and I     have no reason   to doubt its accuracy.    It is placed out
of doors facing the NE, with a projecting edge of brick-work
to defend it from the rays of the rising sun.
    My barometer is a wheel instrument, therefore I do not rely
on it for extreme accuracy, but as affording sufficient informa
tion of the vicissitudes in the pressure of the atmosphere. In,
my observations with this instrument, the letters r.f. s. denote
that the mercury is either rising, falling, or stationary, at the
time of noting the observation.
    I generally register my observations in a morning only, but
on particular occasions they are repeated oftener, especially be
tween nine and ten at night.       The journal is not kept, perhaps,
with that accuracy and regularity which are necessary to meet
the public eye, but merely for my own amusement, and as con
nected with observations on the culture of certain plants which
at present occupies my attention.

 for the first time this year.     This pump is situated in a warm
 Rumford kitchen, which is in use daily from eight o'clock in the

 factorily proves to my mind, that the thermometer had been se
 veral degrees below 20° during the night.

 thermometer rose to 22° during the day, and is now at 26".
    The weather continued with the common cold of winter till
 Thursday the lath of the same month, when it began to thaw,
and the barometer, which had been stationary at 29-91 for three
 days, began to fall in the evening.     The next day was very hazy,
 and the thaw continued with a falling barometer, and the ther
 mometer at 42°.
    I leave it for others who have more leisure and abilities than
 myself, to settle the apparent discrepancy in the accounts that
 have been published respecting the intense cold with which this
 kingdom has lately been visited.       But I must confess that one
 of the motives which has induced me to give this public testi
 mony of the facts that I noticed, was an observation in the Me
 teorological Report, published in the Monthly Magazine for
 February, where the reporter boldly asserts, that he is
                                                               " quite
sure that those    u,ho  talk of the thermometer being at 6° or 2&
 below the freezing point are under a mistake."
    Now, sir, I do not pretend to be either wiser or more accurate
 than others who have paid attention to this subject, but am
 (' quite sure" that 1 was wide awake when I examined my
 thermometer; — aye, and at the time too when I noted in my
journal the facts above related, And having been in the habit
of making meteorological observations for nearly 30 years, it is
very probable that I may have acquired some portion of exact
ness, if not of facility in reading off figures from the graduated
scale of a philosophical instrument, at least within half a dozen
 degrees !    And I do aver, that at half past eight o'clock on the
morning of Friday the 9th ult., Fahrenheit's thermometer stood
 at zero ! and as the sun rose with splendour at a quarter past
seven o'clock on that morning, I have but little hesitation in be
lieving that at two hours before sun-rise the thermometer was
some degrees below zero !

    Recollecting the degrees of cold which are destructive to dif
ferent vegetables growing in this kingdom, that even turneps on
the ground in winter are injured by 24° and totally destroyed
by 30J below the freezing point; we may naturally conclude
that great devastation must have been committed by the late
severe weather : but the destruction would have been unparalleled
in this kingdom, had not the ground been previously covered by
snow, especially as the sun rose with splendour on the morning
of the 9th ult., thus greatly augmenting the danger to the living
principle. Therefore, when we reflect upon these circumstances,
what a powerful source of gratitude they ought to prove in
our minds, to that great and beneficent Being, who has spread
such a protecting mantle over the fertile fields of this highly cul
tivated country    !

XLIV.      On Aerostation.       By Richard Loveia Edgeworth,
                        Esq. F.R.S. &c. &c. &c.
                              To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,   —-  There is      something apparently selfish and ungracious
in claiming inventions that are published by others.             But in
philosophy, as well as in law, a fatal error is often committed by
laches, — or, in plain English, by leaving unclaimed, for a length-
 of time, a right that belongs to us.
    The ingenious Sir George Cayley has frequently proposed to
 impel flying bodies, by letting them descend obliquely through
 the air, and forcing them in a contrary obliquity against the air
by impelling them upwards.           He refers to Mr. Evans's paper in
your Magazine       for  November   last.   Now, sir, I did actually ap*
 ply  this  invention to a small fire-balloon at my own house in
 the year 1786, which confirmed me in the opinion of the prac
 ticability of this invention. But as there were a great number
of thatched houses in my neighbourhood, I desisted from making
 further trials.
    In 1802 J became acquainted with M. Montgolfier at Paris,
 when two of my friends who were with me, asked M. Montgolfier
 whether any practicable means of directing balloons had ever
 been communicated to him.           He replied, " Never, but in a let
 ter from a gentleman in Ireland."           One of my friends imme
 diately inquired, whether that      letter had been communicated tp
 him in the year 1£82, by the Marquis de la Poype, of Bourg en
                                                                 Bresse,

   186                          On Aerostation.
  Bresse.      He said that it was.     " Then," said my friend,  " that
  letter was written by Mr. Edgeworth, for I saw it when it was
 ^dispatched."
      Montgolfier was extremely pleased; took the' trouble of ex
  plaining to me many of his ingenious contrivances, particularly
  his belief hydr antique.
      I cannot omit to mention an instance of M. Montgolfier's
  candour and generosity.         After having taken considerable pains
  to obviate objections which had been made to his parachute,
   I communicated to him the means of rendering the descent of
   the parachute perfectly safe and equable.
      When we were going away, we passed through the magnifi
   cent staircase of the Conservatoire des Arts ei Metiers, Rue
   St. Martin.     " There," said he, pointing to the dome, " is
   an instance of national gratitude ; you see the remains of my
   original balloon suspended from the roof, and my parachute
   annexed to it.      I will have my parachute taken down, and yours
  substituted in its place."
      These, however, are relations resting merely on assertion,-—
  but in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, vol. vi.
  page 101, there is in an Essay of'mine the following note:
      " A balloon may be carried forward with certainty and celerity
  in any direction where there is no perceptible wind, if it is al
   ternately lowered and elevated by altering from time to time its
  specific gravity, which may be done by various means, without
  losing much hydrogen gas ; and if it be furnished with fins or
  small sails, and be set to a proper angle, with its line of ascent
  and descent, their vertical pressure against the air will impel the
  balloon forward."
      " Swift manoeuvres his Laputa in this manner :
      " I tried this invention on a small balloon in the house of the
  late ingenious Dr. Usher, (Professor of Astronomy in the Univer
  sity of Dublin), the friend of science, and of those who wished
  to improve it."
      I do not mean to insinuate in the most remote manner, that
   Sir George Cayley or Mr. Evans knew any thing of my inven
  tion ; probably they never heard my name ; and far from wishing
• to derogate from their merit, 1 shall with pleasure contribute to
  a subscription for carrying on any practicable plan for the ad
  vancement of aerostation.         Earnestly hoping that it may be ap
  plied to better purposes than those to which it has been hitherto
   unworthily confined,

     Report   of the Labours of the       French Architects at Rome.     1 S7
     P. S. — One of the most powerful .means of retarding the pro
 gress of aerostation has been ridicule.             In the Essay to which
 I have alluded there is the following passage :
     " The disposition to ridicule every scientific project as absurd,
 until it has been absolutely brought to perfection, has been the
 common topic of complaint amongst men of inventive genius ;
 and it is curious to observe, that poets, who suffer so much them
 selves by the taunts of men of the world, and by the apathy of
 the vulgar, should in their turn revenge themselves upon men of
 science, and treat their speculations with disdain.              Ben Jonson
 lias attempted this, in one of his masques, with a degree of hu
 mour which is not always the portion of those who throw ri
dicule on science.          Merefool, the clown of the piece, consults
 an adept, who promises to instruct him in all occult secrets, and
 to show him apparitions of all the learned men of the ancients;
 but every man who is called for happens to be busy, from Py
 thagoras, 'who has rashly run himself upon an employment of
keeping asses from a field of beans,' to Archimedes, who is
"uieditating the invention of
                    ' A  rare mouse-trap with owls' wings,
                      And  a cat's foot to catch the mice alone.'
     "  Not only the same taste for ridicule, but the same ideas,
 we find repeated, with a slight alteration, at different aras.
Aristophanes and Lucian amongst the ancients ; and Butler,
 Swift, and Voltaire, the three modem masters of ridicule, have
in   various shapes the same ideas, and are alike disposed to con
found the ingenious and the extravagant.                   The best way of
parrying the stroke of ridicule is to receive it with good hu
mour ; Laugh with those who laugh, and persevere with those
who labour, should be the motto of men who possess the powers
 of invention.
    "  The late Dr. Johnson, who in his Rasselas ridiculed the
idea   of  the art of flying, lived long enough to see the ascent of
the first air-balloon."
 XLV.     Report made by Messrs. Heurtier, Percier, and Du-
    Fourny, to the Class of Fine Arts of the French Institute, rfx
     the Labours of the French Architects at Rome during the                  -
     Years 1812 and 1813*.
 Gentlemen, — You will             recollect that the labours prescribed
 by your regulations to the pupils who are architectural pensioners
                    *
                       lacgusin Encyclopidique,   Nov.  1815.

  18$                   Report  of the Labours of
of the French government at the Academy of Rome           are divided
 into two classes.
    The one comprehends studies of the details which during the
first three years of their residence they ought to furnish, in or
der to show how they had been employing their time, and the
progress which they are making in the study of the art ; works
the property of which remains with the author.
    The other description of labours consists in the restoration of
ancient monuments, which the pupils ought to undertake during
their residence, and present in a finished state at the expiration
of their term.      These restorations, which we may regard as the
.completion of their education, appertain to government.
    Your commission has followed the order of this division, in the
examination which you have directed them to make of the works
sent from Rome this year.       Their report will embrace, first, the
analysis of the studies of annual details ; and secondly, that of
the restoration of antique monuments.
    M. Suys, one of your pupils, has extended his researches over
the three orders of architecture.
    In order to study the Doric and Ionic orders, he has judi
ciously chosen those of the theatre of Marcellus, as the most
correct of the edifices of ancient Rome, and even of Italy.         Of
the three drawings which he has made, one traces the whole
ai   the two orders raised on each other, with the arcades made
in the intercolumniations : the two other drawings, the details
of each of these orders; i. e. its base, capital, and entablature.
    As to the Corinthian order — among the excellent models con
tained in ancient Rome, M. Suys gives the preference to that
of the temple of Mars the Avenger, which, better than any other
perhaps, demonstrates how, by adding boldness to grace, the
genius of the ancients knew how to impress character on front
elevations the most elegant and rich.
    Of the four drawings which he has given of this monument,
the first gives the plan and general elevation, taken from the
work of Labacco, and which he has borrowed.         The other three
drawings present the elevation of two of the three intercolumni
ations which are still standing, and the working details of the
base, capital, architrave, and rich ceiling which covers the porr
 tico.
    M. Suys    deserves no less praise   for the care whieh   he   has
t tken to^point out throughout the nature of the materials, and
their fine execution, than for the skill with which he has given
the character of the precious ornaments with which this order is
enriched.      By following this course M. Suys may expect suc
cess at ev^ry step of his career.
    it is certainly surprising that Desgodetz, so .careful in general
                                                                    I?

Rome. Perhaps he regarded it as a monument of sculpture rather
than of architecture; perhaps also, ignorant as he was of drawing,
lie despaired of being able to give its beauties.
    However this may be, M. Chatillon has given a proof of his
taste in selecting this splendid monument of antiquity for one of
the subjects of his studies.
    He has executed five drawings ; which present, 1st, The plan
 and elevation of the whole column, and surmounted, as it was
 when entire, by the statue of the emperor Trajan : 2dly, The
 facade of the pedestal at the entrance side, with the base and
 capital of the column: finally, two fragments of another face of
 a pedestal, which exhibit the trophies, eagles, and other orna
 ments.     These studies or figures are exceedingly well drawn,
 and are calculated to give a favourable idea of those which M.
 Chatillon has since made on the portico of Octavius, and the
 transmission of whieh is announced.
     M. Provost has directed his attention to the remains of the
 Temple of Jupiter Tonans.
     We know that, buried almost entirely under the ruins of the
 edifice of the Mons Capitolinus, on the slope of which it was
 constructed, this temple has long exhibited no other remains
 than three isolated columns, forming the right angle of the pe
 ristyle of its anterior facade: they were besides buried in such
 a way as to show only the upper part of their shafts, the capitals,
 and part of the entablature: so that none of the architects
 who since the revival of the art have published collections of
 antiquities, had either seen or given the toute ensemble.
     M. Provost, profiting by the excavations made around the feet
 of those columns under the auspices of the French government,
 during his stay at Rome, not only surveyed them entire, but
 executed four drawings of their details.
     The first contains the total elevation of the intercolumniation
 which forms the angle of the interioi1 facade, from the level of
 the ancient soil to the summit of the entablature, with all the
 various plans, sections and profiles, necessary to its development.
     The three other drawings are consecrated to.the details; such
 as the base and the capital, the entablature of the sofite of the
 architrave, and the frieze of sacrificial instruments which runs
 along the flank of the temple.
     Thus (thanks to M. Provost) we now enjoy for the first time
 a complete view of the Temple of Jupiter Tonans, one of the
 most magnificent of ancient Rome ; and that without contradic-,
 tion which unites in the highest degree the luxury of ornament
 with delicacy* and neatness of execution.
                                                                  mi

190                     Report   of Ike Labours of
      The most essential particulars        in this new Corinthian model
are :
       The difference of breadth which exists between the two m-
      1 .
tercolumniations of the angle ; that of the anterior face having
three modules,     whereas that of the flank has only two and a
half. This kind of irregularity has been occasioned, according
to all appearance, by the great proximity of the ancient edifice
called Tabularium, which, not admitting of giving the flank of
the temple the accustomed depth, constrained the architect to
reduce the breadth of the intercolumniations.
    2. The height of the column, which, being carried to ten
diameters and a fourth, presents one of the most slender and
eleoant Corinthian proportions with which we are acquainted.
    3. The nature of the stylobate, which consists of a simple
 marble die, without base or cornice, and one diameter high,
                                 ,
placed under each column.
    4. Finally, the steps which, practised in the intervals between
the dies, served for the ascent from the ancient way to that of
the peristyle of the temple.       This practice of placing the steps
iii the thick part of the pedestals of the columns had not been
before remarked, except in the ancient Temple of Minerva at
Assise.    The presents   is  a new instance, which deserves to be
imitated on all occasions, when        it   not permitted to bring in
                                            is
front of the peristyle the steps by which we are to aseend it.
    M. Gauthier has presented various interesting studies for the
years 1812 and 1813.       They consist in      drawing of the con
                                                 a
sole of the arch of Titus  ;   in the restoration of the Temple of
Jupiter Stator; and in that of the Temple of Peace         :the whole
forming fifteen large drawings.
    The console placed at the key-stone of the arch of Titus, one
of the finest which we see in ancient monuments,          very beauti
                                                          is
ful   besides the foliage and other ornaments with which
      :                                                            it   is
enriched,   itpresents in its anterior front a figure standing, very
much decayed, which, according to the attributes still percepti
ble, seems to have represented the City of Rome, with the hel
met on her head, supported on          a lance, and holding a crown
of laurel.    M.  Gauthier   has   drawn this console both in front
and in profile, in  a broad and soft manner, and in the propor
tion of half of the real size  ;   atask which has not hitherto been
attempted.
   In three other drawings he gives the plan and elevation as re
stored, of the Temple of Jupiter Stator.     For a long time, as
is well known, the remains of this temple were reduced to three
isolated columns, and of which     portion of the shaft, the base,
                                       a
and the stylobate were buried so deep, that hitherto those parts
had not hitherto been observed.     M. Gauthier, profiting      an by
                                                       excavation

                    the French Architects at Rome.               10t
excavation in 1S13, by the orders of the French government,
around those columns, and carried to the level of the first course
of their foundations, ascertained that they had, not steps, (as in
dicated by Palladio,) but one continued stylobate formed of large
blocks of stone covered with marble slabs ; and consequently
these columns must have formed part of the lateral peristyle of
the temple.
   These observations, and the precise measurements which he
has taken to all those parts, have afforded him the means of
fixing with certainty the general proportions of the whole, left
incomplete to the present time'; and consequently to restore in
a suitable manner the plan of the temple and the entire eleva
tion of its fapade.     The capital and the entablature are given
with great truth,   and  in such a way as to give a just idea of the
magnificence of this monument; one of the purest models which
students can possess for beauty of general proportion, graceful
ness of profile, and the exquisite taste of the ornaments with
which they are enriched without profusion.
   The Temple of Peace, which M. Gauthier made the object of
his studies in 181tJ, did not present in his opinion the same kind
of merit. Certainly the same purity is visible both in the ge
neral character of this monument, and in the distribution, taste,
and execution of its ornaments : we cannot even refuse to ad
mit that the ensemble of its character resembles strongly that
of theThermai and other edifices built in the time of Dioclesian,
the first aera of the decline of the art : but the inagnificent ar
rangement of the plan, the colossal dimensions of the masses,
and the means of construction employed to ensure the necessary
stability, furnish a new source of investigation.
   For these reasons the Temple of Peace has from the earliest
times fixed the attention of studious architects.     From the first
sera of the restoration of the art, Serlio and Palladio published
the drawings of it ; an example which was followed by many
others, particularly by Desgodetz, who, more exact, corrected
the mistakes of his predecessors, but cannot give as yet any thing
but an incomplete work ; because, in his time as at present, the
remains of this edifice were buried under enormous ruins, which
rendered every inquiry fruitless.
   What artists have long desired, the French government ha*
undertaken.      By excavations executed by their orders in 1812
and 1813, the entire surface of the ground-floor of the building
was cleared, and which in some places was covered with more
than twenty-five feet of earth.
   M. Gauthier followed step by step these excavations, and mea
sured and drew not only all the vestiges of the plan of the edifice,
but even the smallest fragments of ornaments which appeared. to
                                                                  be

  192                   Report of the Lalours of
 be adapted to throw light on its decoration : and the result of thes«
 inquiries has been given to the world by him in twelve drawings;
 three of which exhibit the plan and elevation of the edifice in
 its present state of ruin, with the indication of the parts unco
 vered in the excavations : and in the other drawings, the monu
 ment is restored entirely, with all the details of the orders which
 decorate it both externally and internally.
    The most remarkable parts of this restoration, because they
 are absolutely new, are :
     1. The plan, section, and external elevation of the portico
 which ranged along the whole eastern part of the edifice, and
 preceded its entrance on the side of the Colyseum: the com
 partments of the pavement in cipoline and yellow antique marble,
 and those of the groined arches adorned with caissons.
    2. The plan, more exact and complete than hitherto drawn,
 of the three naves composing the body of the temple, with all
 the compartments of its magnificent pavement formed of the
 most valuable marbles, such as violet breche, the yellow antique,
 the green granite, porphyry, and serpentine.
    3. The entire decoration of the grand circular niche which
 occupies the middle of the north flank, restored according to
 the fragments of bases, columns, capitals, and entablatures dis
 covered in this part.    The bad style of these fragments and their
 coarse execution, added to the vestiges of a Christian altar found
 also in this place, lead the author to conjecture that the deco
 ration of this niche has undergone changes at the time of the
 edifice being converted into a church.
    4. The lateral entrance made in the flank of the temple op
 posite to this niche, and which ought to have looked into the Via
 Sacra.
    5 . The measurements in detail of the grand column now raised
 oir the plan of St. Mary Major, and which, as we already know,
 was taken from the Temple of Peace.           It results from these
measurements, given for the first time with precision, that this
 column presents the singularity of being thickened about one-
 third up the shaft, and diminishing very little at its upper part:
 without doubt, in order to present more strength to the arch,
 and more resistance to the burthen which it had to support.
    6. Finally, the most valuable of these restorations, because it
 was the most unexpected, is that of the decoration of the arch
 which covered the central nave of the edifice. It has been
 drawn from the numerous fragments discovered in the excava
tions, collected and combined by M. Gauthier, so as to repro
duce not only the arrangement of the various square caissons,
lozenges, ovals and triangulars, of which it is composed, but the
minutest ornament in stucco with which it wns enriched ; so

                    the French Architects at Rome.                   193
  that there remains nothing more to desire upon this most im
 portant part of the decoration of the edifice.
     It appears that the excavations hitherto executed have not
 presented any indication which proved that this edifice had been
  connected with any other ; whence it has been hastily concluded
 that it has never formed part of a palace or a suite of baths, as
 generally thought.      Nevertheless, before giving up this idea, it
 would be necessary to try an excavation which has hitherto been
 neglected.     This is of the ground comprehended between the
 Temple of Peace and the two halls adjoining, vulgarly called the
  Temples of the Sun and Moon.          This excavation, well directed,
 would perhaps discover the ancient communications which have
 been suspected to exist between these edifices with the mere
 foundation, as the Temples of the Sun and Moon exhibit a
 striking analogy to the Temple of Peace, both in their construc
 tion and in the compartments in stucco with which their arches
 are adorned.
     Such a discovery would remove every doubt : for the more
 attentively we consider the edifice in question, in whole or in
 parts, — the style of its architecture being evidently inferior to that
 which prewiiled in the time of Claudius and Vespasian, to whom
 the erection has been ascribed, and particularly the arrange
 ment of its plan, which, similar to that of the halls of the baths
 or palaces, has nothing in common with the well-known ar
 rangements of the temples of tlTe ancients, — the more we are per
 suaded that tradition is defective respecting the true destination
 of this edifice.
    As to its date, it is sufficient to cast our eyes on the drawings
of M.Gauthier, who has with the most praiseworthy fidelity given
 the true character of the details, in order to be convinced that
ornaments of a style and execution semi -barbarous cannot be
the work of the Augustan age of architecture.
    M. Gauthier has added to his drawings an explanatory notice,
in which he gives not only the description of the various parts
of the edifice, but also all the details of its construction, which he
has studied with the greatest care, besides every information rela
tive to the excavations, in which have been found the materials
which served as his authority for establishing with certainty the
restoration of the received parts of this vast monument.
    In a word, the restoration of the Temple of Peace, which was
not obligatory on M. Gauthier, does honour in every respect to
his zeal and talents^ and cannot but augur well for that of the
Temple of Mars the Avenger, which he has just finished for th«
government.       His work is the more precious, as, several frag
ments which served as his authority being already destroyed, it
is not possible now to make one more complete.           This last con-
    Vol. 47. No. 215. March 1816.               N            sideration

194                   Report   of the Labours of
sideration ought to induce the class to ask M. Gauthier, to whom
we are indebted for this restoration of the Temple of Peace, to
present the same to government, in order to be added to those
which it already possesses, and among which it will hold a most
distinguished place.
     The bare review of the works presented by Messrs. Suys,
Chatillon, Provost, and Gauthier, for their annual tribute of
 1812 and 1 813, demonstrates that, so far from having neglected
to fulfil the obligations imposed by the regulations, they have
even outstepped them.        Their zeal in this respect does not merit
less eulogy than their eagerness to profit by the excavations,
ordered with so much munificence by the French government, of
 most of the monuments of Roman magnificence.
     While on this subject, it may be necessary to remind our readers
 that from the year 1809 to the end of 1813 the French au
 thorities at Rome have incessantly excavated and laid bare, for
 the sake of the advancement of erudition and the instruction of
 architects, the remains of the chief edifices of ancient Rome :
 it is thus that we have successively seen exposed to view the
 temples of Antoninus and Faustina, of Vesta, of Fortuna Virilis,
 of Concord, of Jupiter Tonans, of Peace, of the Sun, the Moon,
 and Jupiter Stator ; the arches of Janus, and of the Goldsmiths,
 the column of Phocas, Trajan's Forum, the baths of Titus; and
 lastly, the Colyseum.
     The restorations of ancient monuments, made for the govern
 ment by Messrs. Leclerc and Huyot, and of which the com
 mittee is about to give an account, will not be less interesting.
     Among the ancient edifices which time has respected, none is
 more imposing, better preserved, or rather less damaged, than
 the Pantheon: none is better calculated to give an elevated idea
 of the genius of the ancients for architecture ; for even at the
  time it was erected (which was the most flourishing sera of the
 art) it was regarded as one of the most beautiful chefs-d'eeurre.
  It is in this way that Pliny, Dion Cassius, Suetonius, Ammianus
  Marcellinus, Spartianus, &c. speak of it.
     The moderns have paid the same adoration to it: from the
  happy epoch of the revival of the art, learned men and artists
  have unceasingly made it the subject of their meditations and
  studies.    The most celebrated architects, Serlio, Palladio, Pietro
  Ligorio, Fontana, Desgodetz, Piranesi, have published the mea
  surements ; and the two latter in particular with such precision
  that their works appear to leave nothing to be desired.
     This subject had not therefore the advantage of novelty: nay,
  it was even to all appearance exhausted. M. Leclerc, however,
  has chosen it as the subject of one of his restorations, and he has
  no reason to complain of want of success.
                                                                     I»

                       the French Architects at Rome.                  195
        In a series of twenty-one drawings executed with the most
    rare intelligence and on a very large scale, M. Leclerc has not
    only revived as it were, his subject by the immense developments
    which he has given both to the tout ensemble and to the de
    tails, and by the art with which he has developed them ; but he
    has succeeded in giving a more complete work than any one has
    done hitherto, and new even in many respects in consequence of
    the numerous discoveries with which he has enriched it.
        In the state of impossibility in which the committee find them
    selves of indicating all of them, they will content themselves with
    describing the most important, beginning with those which are
    relative to the external parts of the temple.                     * .
         1. Hitherto we have not had an exact drawing of the flight
    of steps by which, from the place in front of the Pantheon, its
    portico was attained.      This external part of the edifice having
    been long covered by the successions of rubbish thrown on the
    adjacent ground, each had drawn it according to his own ideas,
  "
     his taste, or fancy.    M. Leclerc, according to the observations
     made and the vestiges discovered at the time of the excavations
     of 1801, in front as well as upon the flanks of the portico and
    of the body of the temple, has restored this interesting part in
    its true form.
         He shows that the ground of the surrounding square was
     paved with large irregular flags of Travertine marble, and that
     the temple was ascended by means of four steps of white mar
    ble ; at the top of which was a broad pavement or foot-path
     which extended not only over the whole of the fa9ade, but even
     over the outskirts of the circumference of the temple, where it
     was sustained by a continued stylolalvm.
         2. Vitruvius in the second chapter of his third book, treating of
     the various thicknesses to be given to columns according to the
     different breadths of the intercolumniatious, prescribes the thick
     ening of a fiftieth part of the diameter of the columns placed in the
     angle of the porticos : " because," he says,
                                                    " the great light which
     strikes them more than the others making them appear' more
     slender, it is necessary to remedy this false appearance, which
     would otherwise deceive the eye."
         M. Leclerc has verified that the column of the angle of the
,
     portico towards the right of the spectator is in fact stronger
     than the others by a fiftieth nearly of its diameter ; the column
     of the opposite angle does not exhibit the same conformity with
      the precept of Vitruvius, but we know that it was placed there
      at the time of a very modern restoration.
         3. The two great niches which occupy the bottom of the
      aisles of the portico, stripped for a long time of every indication
      of covering, have been hitherto drawn smooth and without any
                                        N 2                            kind

  196                     Report   of the Labours of
  kind of ornament by Serlio, Palladio and Desgodetz, a baremiesi
  which agrees badly with the richness of the general appearance.
  Piranesi is the only person who of late years has suspected that
 those niches were formerly covered with marble.            M. Leclerc,
  pushing his observations further, has ascertained by the arrange
  ment of the holes of the rivetings perceptible in the bricks, that
 not only were they covered with marble throughout their whole
  circumference, but also that thev had an impost, which received
 a fillet or archivolt of marble also which stretched around the
  ceinture of the niche.
     4. He is also the first who remarked, above the interior cor
 nices of the portico, the chases cut for receiving the bronze
 arches which cover the three naves of the portico: an observa
 tion which, added to the authority of Serlio, Pietro Ligorio and
 Palladio, has afforded him the means of restoring in its primitive
 form that part of the portico the magnificence of which exceeded
.all idea.
     5 . The three cornices, which begird at different heights the
 external circumference of the temple, had not been drawn exactly
 either by Desgodetz or Piranesi.           M. Leclerc has ascertained
 the   true profile, as  well as the stucco  ornaments of which he has
 discovered the remains : so that we may regard as new the de
 tails which he gives of those three cornices.
     6. He has also examined with care the upper part of the
 creeping cornice of the front, in order to ascertain if there had
 been at the extremities pedestals for supporting statues, as
 Serlio, rjalladio, Desgodetz and Piranesi have drawn therri ; and
 he has ascertained that there were pedestals on the pediment
 only, and not at the angles.
     7. This inquiry, for which he was compelled to remove the
 tiles which cover this part, led him to perceive a range of holes'
 extending above the whole of the creeping cornice of the front :
 a certain proof that the front was surmounted by a frieze of
 ornaments cut in marble or bronze, and which he has conse
 quently thought himself entitled to give in his drawing.
     8. Not content with having developed, in a particular elevation
 and section, the ornaments and all the details of construction of
 this frontispiece, from the first course of the foundations to the
 summit of the pediment, M. Leclerc formed the happy idea of
 bringing together, on the same paper and on the same scale, the
 details of the construction of other antique frontispieces which
 time has respected.          Such are the Doric frontispieces of the
 small Temple of Paestum and that of Hercules at Cori, the Ionic
 frontispiece of the Temples of Fortuna Virilis and of Concord
 at Rome, and the Corinthian frontispiece of the portico of Oe-
 tavius at Rome,        In short, this is a drawing as novel as it is in
                                                              structive,

                 the French Architects at Rome.                 197
 structive, which, exhibiting under one and the same point of
view the parallel of the construction of the best preserved an
 cient frontispieces, facilitates the comparison of the materials em
 ployed, as well as that of their section, their ornaments, and other
 means of execution.
    9. Doubts had been always ente.tained respecting the simul
taneous      construction of the two frontispieces which we re
marked at the facade of the Pantheon.            Those of good taste,
and even the most enlightened artists, shocked at this vicious
double employment of the frontispiece, which being only a mere
representation of the roof ought to be essentially unique in a
building, did not hesitate to pronounce that these two fronts
could not have existed together in the primitive state of the
 Pantheon, and that doubtless the posterior frontispiece formed,
the summit of a first facade, on which had been placed afterwards
the portico and its frontispiece.
    However plausible this opinion may be, it must give way to
 the evidence of the result obtained by M. Lcclerc : according to "
a series of observations too long to detail, but directed with the
greatest sagacity, he has concluded, and demonstrated by his
drawings, not only that the horizontal cornice of the posterior
 frontispiece ha? not been cut with a view to introduce therein
the frontispiece of the portico, but that it has been always thus
from the origin of the edifice, and that the intimate connexion
of the construction of these two frontispieces with that of the
body of the edifice does not admit of a doubt that they had
been constructed at the same time.
    10. One of the most important points to elucidate, because
it serves to decide what has always been the true destination of
the monument, was to examine      if,   aas  number of writers have
asserted, the Pantheon originally formed part of the baths of
Agrippa, of which   it     must have formed one of the principal
apartments.      By an attentive examination of the posterior part
of the edifice, to which are still attached considerable remains
of those baths, M. Lcclerc has ascertained that in fact they were
immediately contiguous to the Pantheon, that the masonry of
the two edifices was intimately connected to     a    certain height,
that even the second exterior cornice of the Pantheon went round
and seemed to have prevailed on the body of the edifice for the
baths;    but that there was no aperture and no orifice to warrant
the idea that there had ever existed between them any interior
and direct communication    :      hence he concluded that from its
origin the Pantheon had always been a temple.
  If   from the exterior of the Pantheon we pass with M. Leclero
into the interior, we shall find that his studies and inquiries have
not been less fruitful,

198                    Report of the Labours of
    11. Some writers have asserted that the small buildings or
tabernacles, which to the number of eight are distributed around
its circumference, were added at the time of the consecration
of the temple to the worship of the Christian religion : this
mistake is entirely cleared up by the developments which
M. Leclerc gives of their construction.    These demonstrate that
it is and  always  has been connected with that of the body of the
edifice; and that those altars or tabernacles have existed from
the origin, and have undergone no other alterations than those
occasioned by successive reparations and the change of religion.
    12. The friezes of running palm-leaves, which M. Leclerc
has drawn on the frontispieces of these altars, as well as on the
cornice of the interior order, are fully warranted by the holes
which he found in these parts, indications which had not pre
viously been observed.
    13. Finally, various sections taken on the great semicircular
and square niches distributed around the interior circumference,
show that the construction of the Corinthian order which deco
rates them, is so connected with that of the body of the temple
that it becomes impossible to suppose, as has generally been
done, that this order was added afterwards.
    Such are the observations and researches which led Af. Leclerc
to conclude :
    1. That the building of the Pantheon,     from its original con
struction,   has been destined to serve  as  a  temple ; and never
formed part of the baths of Agrippa, with which it has not any
direct communication.
    2. That the Corinthian order which decorates the interior,
and that of the entrance' portico, date from the epoch of the
primitive construction of the edifice, and are not additions made
to the circular part of the temple subsequent to the time of
Agrippa.
    If we refer to those who have written on the subject, we find
all of them to be of a contrary opinion.      According to. Michael
Angelo, quoted by Vasari (Life of Sansovino), the Pantheon was
the work of three architects, the first of whom built the interior
 order to its entablature, the second the attic, and the third the
 external portico.
    In order to set aside an opinion so generally adopted, other
methods than simple reasonings are wanted.            M. Leclerc was
 aware of this; and freeing himself from all spirit of system, guided
 merely by the light of actual observation, he has had the merit
 of being the first to throw true light on those important ques
 tions, by means of almost ocular demonstration.
    The results which he thus obtained deserve the more confi-
 dencej that they have not been admitted by him until after having
                                                                 been

  been discussed with the most enlightened antiquaries and artists
  of Rome, to whom he communicated them on the very ground
  as soon as the discoveries were made, and who were obliged to
  sacrifice their opinions to the evidence of their senses.
      These results are besides perfectly in unison both with the
  inscription which the frontispiece bears, and with Pliny, the only
  one of the ancient writers who saw this monument entire; for
  by using the words Pantheum ab Jgrippa factum, he has evi
  dently testified that the erection of this building as well as its
  completion was owing to the munificence of the same man : the
  conception and execution were consequently the fruits of one
  and the same genius.
      To this rapid sketch of the principal observations of M. Le-
   clerc the committee ought to add : 1st, That he has particularly
   endeavoured to give their true character to the ornaments, and
  to represent with the most scrupulous exactitude the nature,
  the arrangement, even the colour of the materials ; in short, all
  the details of construction, unnoticed for the most part or badly
  indicated hitherto.    2dly, That he has added to his drawings
  very satisfactory explanatory notes, containing the description of
, the monument,       the indication of the sources where he got   it,
  and the authorities to which he refers for restoring the lost parts.
  3rdly, That the numerous drawings which M. Leclerc has de
  dicated to this fine restoration are executed in every respect
  with a perfection to entitle them to serve as models of their
  kind and that henceforth we cannot expect to see the Pantheon,
      ;
   that chef-d' ueuvre of ancient grandeur, grace, and harmony,
  represented in all its details with more intelligence, purity, and
  precision.
     M. Huyot    has   presented the restorations of the celebrated
  Temple of Fortune,     as well as the Forum of the ancient city of
  Prseneste.
     We know that this city (now Palsestrina)   situated in Latium,
                                               is
  twenty-three miles from Rome, towards the east, and rises into
  an amphitheatre    on the slope of     amountain forming the ex
  tremity of one of the branches of the Apennines.
     Its origin is of the highest antiquity. Cicero savs that he
  cannot assign  the  epoch of it:what appears certain    is,
                                                           that long
  before the founding of Rome this city had its gods and temples,
  the most considerable of which was that of Fortune, who was
  afterwards worshipped throughout all Italy.
     When Sylla assumed the dictatorship (B. C. 82) Praeneste
  contained buildings of great importance.     Cicero speaks of its
  walls as being of an opus incertum,ox irregular polygons, which
  he says was  a construction  inuse among the Dorians   : he speaks
                                 N   4                            also

200                    Report  of the Labours of
also of a large space exposed to the sun, which         he calls  So
            '
 larium.
    According to Suetonius,      the Forum occupied the space con
tained between the public road and the foot of the temple : it
had two ground plans, the one inferior and the other superior,
and its porticos were adorned with statues.         There were also
to be seen there, according to Varro, two Basilicae, one called
^Emilia, the other Fulvia, and a Gnomon.
     Livy speaks of a statue of Jupiter Imperator, who was held
in great veneration, and who doubtless had a temple in the
Forum. Authors also mention temples of Juno, Mars, the god
dess Opis, and particularly the famous temple of Fortune, which
situated at the top of the city commanded it, and filled it al
most entirely with its appendages which extended to the Forum.
    After having had kings and various kinds of governments,
Praeneste subjugated by the Romans under the conduct of Cin
cinnati^, destroyed then restored by Sylla, who sent a colony
there, flourished during the emperors, and preserved its splendour
to the fall of the empire.
    From this period Prseneste declined, and in the various devas
tations which it suffered its monuments were destroyed ; on the
ruins of which the modern Palaestrina has gradually been raised.
    The latter increasing from time to time now presents the
singular spectacle of houses, churches, and high palaces, sus
pended as it were on the vast terraces which supported the an
cient edifices.
    It has been through those modern buildings that M. Huyot
has set about seeking out and measuring the remains of the monu
ments which formed the splendour of the ancient Piaeneste.
    The enterprise was the more difficult, as he embarked upon
it almost without guides : those only whom he could consult
were Pietro Ligorio, among whose manuscript drawings a ge
neral plan and perspective view of this temple with its atrium
and appendages were found ; Pietro da Cortona, from whose
drawings a plan and general elevation were engraved on a large
scale ; and Suares, who in his Prceneste Antiqva, and Volpi in
the VetusLatium, have inserted perspective views.
    Inexact and incomplete as these works are, and the fruits of the
imagination      rather than of the observations of their authors,
they could    offer but very feeble assistance.
    Piranesi, that indefatigable investigator of ancient monuments,
has published nothing on the latter : there was therefore a' new
mine to explore, and M. Huyot acquitted himself with the
greatest success.
    lie has given six drawings of the results of his extensive in
                                                             quiries.

q*iries.    The first three give the plan, elevation, and general
section    of the ancient Proeneste, in their present state, and
stripped of the modern constructions which cover them ; the
three other drawings present the plan, elevation, and general
sections of the ancient city, with its chief edifices, restored iti
the state in which they must have existed at the time of Sylla,
an epoch selected by the author to make the restoration.
    We there ascertain the ancient Pramestine way, which leads
from Rome to the principal entrance of the. city; its walls and
various gates ; the easy flight of steps which lead to a first plat
form, on which was established the Forum of the city; which in
its lower part comprehended the Basilica: of Emilia and Fulvia,
the Temples of Juno and ^Esculapius, and the pools of water for
the use of those who came to visit the Temple of Fortuue ; and
in its upper part the Temple of Jupiter Imperator with its por
 ticos.
    Above the Forum are several terraces and flights of steps of
easy ascent, constructed of irregular polygons, which led to a
second platform containing the atrium and the dependences of
 the Temple of Fortune.       Lastly, this temple itself erected on a
 piece of ground still more elevated and crowning the whole.
    In order to appreciate correctly the merit of such a work, we
 must consider the obstacles of every kind which it was necessary
 t o surmount.
    The immense extent of these edifices, and their situation on
 the abrupt slope of a rugged mountain, were already sufficient
 to render very difficult the operations necessary for drawing the-
 plans of their ruins : and how much must the difficulties have
 been increased, by the complete superposition         as it were of a
 modern city, the streets, squares and public buildings of which
 intersect in every direction and disturb the arrangement of the
 ancient city !
     If we reflect that it was in spite of these obstacles, that it was
 necessary first to draw and establish in an accurate manner the
 respective directions and levels of this multitude of terraces made
 at different altitudes on the brow of the mountain; afterwards
 to ascertain the remains of the ancient monuments scattered
 over the platforms which separate these terraces; to discriminate
 between them and the modern construction with which they are
 often confounded by the identity of the materials ; finally, to
 unite and arrange all these fragments, and to form a whole out
 of them, which should agree at once with the notices left by au
  thors, the vestiges still existing, and the rules of art ; we may
 easily suppose that, to succeed in such an enterprise, it would be
 necessary to join to a consummate practice in the study of an
 tiquities a perseverance and sagacity of the rarest description.

  202                  Report  of the Lalours of
     To leave nothing unaccomplished, M. Huyot has added to hfs
 drawings a very copious memoir, and which he hopes to have the
 honour to read to the class, in which collecting all the notices
 scattered through writers, he gives a sketch of the history of
 Praneste, and treats of the ancient names of that city, its origin,
 of the various spots of ground which it occupied, and of its suc
 cessive extensions ; of the monuments with which it is embel
 lished, and of the date of their construction : lastly, he describes
 the modern city of Palaestrina, and the remains of the Temple of
 Fortune, the special object of his study.
     This last part is the most interesting for the art, because it
 contains the proper notions for determining the style and cha
 racter of the architecture of the monuments of ancient Pnenestc.
 Although the most ancient, perhaps, of those which we know in
 Italy, they are those only in which we remark the simultaneous
 employment of the three orders of architecture.
     In short, according to the fragments found in the lower part
 of the city, we find that the Doric order was employed in the
 lower part of the Forum : its fluted column with sharp ridges and
without base, and the profile of its capital, resemble closely those
 of the Temple of Hercules at Cori, and the portico which is
known by the name of Pnlularium, the remains of which are
seen on the Capitol.       A stylobatum still preserved in its place,
in the upper part of the Forum, exhibits also the Doric character,
the frieze of its entablature being adorned with triglyphs and
wreaths, executed precisely in the style of those which we see on
 a sarcophagus of the Seipios.
    The Ionic order entered into the decoration of the edifices
dependent on the Temple of Fortune : its capitals, if we are to
judge from those which have been found, were very badly sculp
 tured, and nearly of the same kind with those of the ancient
 portico which is still seen at Perousis.
    As to the Corinthian order, it is that which we meet with most
frequently in the buildings at Praeneste : although repeated ten
times, it is remarkable that its proportion and ornaments are
 always the same : its chapter is decorated with acanthus leaves
turned up, and friezed like those of the capital of the Temple of
 the Sybils at Tivoli, and its height is a single diameter onlv, con
formably to the doctrine of Vitruvius. The cornices of this or
der are profiled in a very simple manner, and exhibit no kind of
 ornament.                                 , •
    With respect to the construction, all the walls, either of the
terraces or of the body of the buildings, are executed in the
epus incertum, composed sometimes of immense blocks of stone
cut in irregular polygons, and placed on each other without ce
ment} sometimes of thin stones mixed and blocked up with lime:

                      the French Architects at Rome.                  203
in several parts of these edifices we see arcades with full cein-
tures, the arches of which exhibit sections regularly furnished.
  These various observations, when compared, lead the author
to conclude that, the monuments of Praeneste having both by the
manner of their construction and the style of their architecture
an evident analogy with the Tepiples of Hercules at Cori, and
of the Sybils at Tivoli, with the tabular inm of the Capitol and
some other remains of antiquity scattered through Etruria,
their erection dates from an epoch at least contemporary, i. e.
far anterior to the foundation of the empire, and that conse
quent! v the style of their architecture may give an idea of that
which was brought by the Greek colonies who came to Italy.
   This hasty sketch of a work which has cost the author three
years labour, during which he made ten voyages to Palaestrina
and a stay of six consecutive months, will be sufficient to de
monstrate its importance.
   In extricating from its ruins the ancient Praeneste, M. Huyot
has not onlv made us acquainted with one of the most celebrated
monuments of antiquity, of which but a very imperfect idea had
been entertained, and one of the vastest and most magnificent
architectural conceptions of the genius of the ancients; but also
a style of architecture little known hitherto, and which for the
sake of the art ought to be more noticed.
   In all these respects the work of M. Huyot is worthy of the
approbation of the class, and he has to thank the government for
permitting him to continue a year longer at Rome.
   Such is the result of the examination which your committee
has made of the works sent lately by the French architects
studying at Rome : this anaylsis, succinct as it         is,
                                                        will be suffi
cient to give a high idea of their importance: and            looking

  XLVI.      On a new Meihod     of obtaining   pure Silver; with Obser*
      vatkms on the Defects        of former    Processes.    By M. Do
      novan, Esq.*
  'There      have been four principal methods proposed for obtain
  ing pure silver.      The first is by cuppellation ; the second, by
  the reduction of     Ittna cornea ; the third, by precipitating silver
 from its nitrous solution by^sulphate of iron ; the fourth, by
 means of that symmetrical precipitation called arbor Diance.
      These different modes labour under defects.          They are either
 inconvenient, uncertain, tedious, unoeconomical, or inadequate.
      In the process of cuppellation, it is true that all the base mts
 tals are carried down by the lead ; but it is not thus possible to
 separate the gold : this is accordingly found in the resulting
 silver.
     The reduction of luna cornea by alkali affords when the pro
 cess succeeds a very pure silver : but the success is doubtful, and
 for the most part fails in the hands of the inexperienced.           It is
 well known that when the crucible is taken from the fire, instead
 of containing pure silver, it is often found entirely empty, so great
is the tendency of the fused matter to pass through the pores,
unless prevented by due skill in the operator.            Another source
 of uncertainty is the degree of heat : if it be too high, the muriate
volatilizes: if too low, the reduction is not completed; and
without singular good fortune, the expected quantity will in no
ease be obtained.         Beside these difficulties,   the process is ex
ceedingly     complex   and  troublesome.    ,
     In the next method, a solution of nitrate of silver is mixed
with very dilute solution of sulphate of iron : the iron acquires a
new dose of oxygen derived from the silver ; the latter is there
fore precipitated.       Unless the sulphate of iron l,e recently pre
pared, it will not have the strong attraction to oxygen necessary;
and either little silver will be obtained, or none.

                                      Society, February 7, 1816.
                                                                      Bu^

                 On a new Method               of obtaining          pure Silver.            205
       But admitting that there is a newly prepared sulphate at hand,
    when its solution is mixed with the nitrate of silver, an addi
    tional dose of oxygen is at once presented to the iron.           When
    the precipitated silver is collected on the filter, there will be found
    in it a quantity of sub-oxysulphate of iron, which, if care be
    taken, can be made by its specific levity to occupy the stratum
    above the silver.
        Another defect in this process              is,
                                           that the silver     not entirely   is
    recovered. If the solution of oxysulphate of iron, from which the
-
    silver has been filtered, be mixed with solution of salt, there will
    be a copious precipitation of muriate of silver.    This happens even
    when    alarge quantity of sulphate   of iron    has been employed                           :
    and in these cases, an additional quantity seems to have no ef
    fect, with such force do the last portions of silver retain their
    oxygen.     Thus the defects of this process are, that         presup           it
    poses the recent preparation of sulphate of iron        that the silver
                                                                          ;
    is not entirely recovered and that what
                                      ;            recovered     not quite
                                                                is                 is
    pure.
       The formation of the arbor Diantz     obviously under the ob
                                                           is
    jection of tediousness and trouble.
       The defects of these processes compelled me to try several
     methods for obtaining pure silver. The following appears to an
    swer expectation      :
        240 grains of standard silver are to be dissolved in as much
    pure nitric acid of s. g. about 1-2, as will be barely necessary
                                                      '
    for the solution.        This     to be filtered, and distilled water al
                                      is
    lowed to run through the filter until the fluids amount to two
    ounces measure.           Abright plate of copper weighing more than
    64 grains     to be immersed, and frequently agitated in it. When
                 is

    the clear supernatant liquor           to be poured off, and the preci

    necessary.

     The only metal, therefore, which adulterates the precipitated

                            To   Mr. Tillock.
Sir, — The        enthusiasm excited        by
                                             the first invention of bal
loons, has like all the other movements of enthusiasm produced
a reaction, which has hitherto involved               a kind of ridicule
                                                      in
every attempt to apply them to any useful purpose, and which
has been fatal to any progress in their improvement.             The steady
march of the human mind, however, ultimately triumphs over
these alternate fits of extravagance and torpor             and the day
                                                               ;              is
probably not very distant, when the theories of ingenious men
controlled   by the sober experiments of science will lead to more
happy results.
    The weight of the machinery necessary to give a mechanical
impulse to balloons, appears to be an insurmountable obstacle
to that mode of conducting them         ;  and the inclined plane lately
recommended          by
                      your ingenious correspondents            liable to the
                                                                   is
same objection, and perhaps in a still greater degree.
    Methods must therefore be devised of rendering the atmo
sphere subservient to their motion and guidance as well as to
their support.^. The contrary currents of air that generally take
place at different elevations are well known; and                 presumed
                                                                   it   is
that   if the balloon were retained near the upper confine of one
stratum, and     if  asmall auxiliary balloon were attached by a rope
and permitted to ascend into another stratum, the velocity of
the former would be sufficiently retarded to admit of its being
 steered in  a course inclined     by   several degrees to the direction
of that current in which      it   floated  : much in the same manner
 that the skilful seaman drops his vessel down a strong tideway,
 by  giving her   a  slight velocity in the opposite direction, which
 enables him to sheer and steer her at pleasure.
    Or, on the contrary, the auxiliary might be made to descend
 in search of    a proper resisting current of air.
    If the stratum should be too extensive to push the auxiliary
 beyond its limits, even then the diminished rapidity of the wind
at a  great elevation would probably produce            sufficient effect.

JVIr. Donovan        has in the press       An Essay on the Origin, Pro
gress, and present      State  of Galvanism, with a Statement of a
new Theory.       It is divided into three parts. The first contains
a sketch of the history of Galvanism divided into four periods.
The second contains investigations speculative and experimental
of the principal hypotheses ; viz. of those of Volta, Fabroni, and
of the British philosophers: of the hypothesis of electro-che
mical affinity as maintained by Davy and Berzelius ; and of the
identity of the agent in Galvanic and electric phenomena.               The
third part comprises a statement of a new theory of Galvanism,
and is divided into two chapters.          The first includes the general
principles   of what   has   been called   the excitement of Galvanism.
The second chapter        is devoted  to  the  application of these prin
ciples in explaining Galvanic phenomena, and is subdivided into
five sections.    The first section treats of Galvanic decompositions
in general.     The second presents a new theory of metallic arbori
zations.    The third explains the source of the light and heat
manifested in certain experiments.             The fourth explains the
source of the     electrical   appearances : and the fifth shows the
cause of the muscular contractions and shock.
    In this theory the agency of an electric or Galvanic fluid is
not admitted; the phaenomena are conceived to be explicable
by the mere operation of chemical affinity.

Withstanding the immense number of dissertations on this phe
nomenon which had been published, still much is wanting to
wards a full and satisfactory solution of the question.      In no
ticing the various methods proposed for explaining capillary at
traction, he remarked that Clairaut was the only philosopher
-who supposed that the attraction of tubes extended to any visi
ble distance ; on the contrary, Newton and all other mathema
ticians considered the sphere of attraction to be confined to the
particles immediately in contact with the tube, and that it did
not extend to any sensible distance.     This has been the generally
received doctrine, and the author thinks it confirmed by the re
 flection of light, as observed in glass.    But the true theory of
this phenomenon       was not known till Professor Leslie, in the
 Philosophical Magazine for 1S02, first stated, in a popular man
ner, that the attraction is in proportion to the dertsity of the
fluid, and that temperature considerably modifies capillary at
 traction.    This discovery Mr. Ivory considers as furnishing the
 means of giving a complete theoretical and experimental ex
planation of this long debated phenomenon.         Having observed
 that most philosophers had dwelt on the theory, and that very
few direct experiments were ever made to ascertain the mode or
 nature and extent of capillary attraction, he commenced a series
 of actual experiments on the subject. He measured the curves
 formed by glass when immersed in a fluid, calculated the mole
 cular attraction of the fluid, &e. and in this manner performed
 a great variety of experiments ; but many more, he observed,
 may still be made without exhausting the subject.         His theo
 retical method differed from that of Laplace, in being susceptible
 of application to physical experiment ; whereas that of the French
 mathematician was founded on the calculus.       The remainder of
 this ingenious paper was of a nature not fit for public reading.

 thod of communicating this Power to Glass, &c.        The new and
 curious researches of this philosopher having led him to investi
 gate particularly the nature of doubly refracting crystals, he has
 at length discovered that if two plates of glass 0'30 of an inch
 thick be bent together, they yield the series of seven colours
  mentioned by Newton.        "He found in every case that pressure
  and thickness imparted to glass the power of polarfeing light ;
 pressure also on plates of glass gives them the power of double
  refraction.   By mechanical pressure he could thus communicate
  to plates of glass, crystals of muriate of soda, &c. the property
  of doubly refracting crystals.

 that the subject of double refraction is still extremely intricate

 magnetism, presents numerous facts, which in the present state
 of our knowledge are yet inexplicable. Crystallization, he thinks,
 is probably owing to a peculiar fluid of which we have yet no
 adequate knowledge : but however this may be, the facts and
 experiments which he has adduced tend to favour the undulatorv
 theory of light, &c.

 injected   fluids  into    the jugular   vein  of  dogs,  and  made   some  ex
 periments on himself with the eau medicinale, and instanced the
 effect it had on his pulse, which is usually 80 in a minute.                 He
 compared the effects with those of mercury taken into the sto
 mach ; and the general result appears to be, that poisons injected
 directly into the blood kill somewhat sooner (although in a si
 milar mode) than if taken into the stomach.

    A list of the presents continued from the 2d volume of the
Society's Transactions will be published in the 3d volume.
    The Council are happy to announce that, according to the
arrangements they have made, the 3d volume of the Geological
Transactions will appear in the course of the present session. It
will contribute, they hope, to direct the attention of the public
to the rational and useful researches that form the subject of its
pages, and to support the reputation which the Society has ac
quired by the publication of its former volumes. The papers sub
mitted to the public in this volume will show that the authors
have continued to act upon the principle of avoiding the dis
cussion of theories which are too systematic and extensive, and
of treating geology principally as a science of observation. .
    The exertions of Mr. Greenough to complete the Geological
Map of England have been incessant, and a great part of the
work is now engraved.
    The Council report with the utmost regret that the President
has expressed his wish of not continuing in the chair beyond the
period for which he originally undertook that office, and which
terminates upon the present anniversary.         The assurances of the
deep sense of the honour conferred upon him, with which he has
accompanied the expression of his wish, will be thought super
fluous by those who have witnessed his conduct during the time
be bas filled the situation, and his unremitting endeavours to
promote the interests of the Society.
    The junior secretary, finding the time occupied by his official
duties incompatible with the claims of other engagements of
considerable importance to himself, begs leave to withdraw him
                                                                   self

self for the present from a trust which the members at large
would no doubt be very desirous again to commit to his tried
activity and abilities.  The arrangement of the most interesting
department of the Society's cabinet, namely, that which illustrates
the natural order of succession of the English strata, is entirely
due to his care and knowledge.       The vacancy occasioned by his
retirement, under a less prosperous state of the Society, it would
not have been easy in an adequate manner to supply.
    It was reported at the last Annual Meeting, that the apart
ments then in the occupation of the Society were altogether in
sufficient for the arrangement of the collection; and the Council,
not unmindful of this evil, has laboured during the whole of the
year to obtain a residence that would meet the growing wants
of the Society.      The necessity of a removal has since become
the more urgent. Notice has been given that the Society intends
to quit its present apartments, and it is now a tenant only by
sufferance.
   A regard to the limited revenues of the Society, and a disin
clination on the part of the Council to call upon the members
for sacrifices, which though intended to be voluntary might by
some be regarded as compulsory, have been the real obstacles to
the attainment of this great object. On resigning its trust for the
year 1815, as the last act of its power, the Council strongly and
earnestly recommends the case to the consideration of the mem
bers.
    At the Annual General Meeting, held 2d February 1816, the
Report of the Council was read and approved ;
    The thanks_of-the Society were voted to William Blake, Esq.
retiring from the office of President ; to George Bellas Green-
ough, Esq. retiring by rotation from the office of Vice President ;
to Henry Warburton, Esq. retiring from the office of Secretary j
to Samuel Solly, Esq. retiring from the office of Foreign Secre
tary ; to William Hasledine Pepys, Esq. retiring from the office
of Treasurer.

    Among the novelties exhibited by French artists during the
yearl815,wefind the following enumerated as the most striking :
     1. Some beautiful specimens of painting on velvet, by M.
 Vauchelet ; among these was a highly-finished portrait of the
 emperor Alexander.
    2. Several utensils of platina, among which are dish covers,
 watch chains, &c. by M. Janets, who has entirely suppressed the
 use of arsenic in his process for rendering platina malleable.
    3. Celestial and terrestrial globes of glass for lamps, most ac^
curately engraved and coloured.

Extract of a iLetter from M: Dobereiner                to   M.Van Mons*.
I                                              Jena, S3H February.
   N a note to p. 59 of my Elements of Pharmaceutical Che
mistrv, I expressed a suspicion that phosphorus might be com
posed of a peculiar substance and of hydrogen. This idea, which
was founded upon a particular experiment, has since been con
firmed.
    If we introduce into a retort three parts of iodine and one of
phosphorus, both as dry as possible, and heat them by the flame
of a spirit lamp, the two bodies will penetrate with an extrica
tion of light and vaporisation of hydro-iodic aeid, and there will
remain in the retort a brilliant substance of a brownish-red co
lour, which, when washed and dried, keeps iti the air without
being altered at the habitual temperature of that fluid : by a
strong heat, however, it inflames and burns in the air, dries,
and forms vapour of phosphoric acid.       As the hydro-iodic acid
is the product of the combination of hydrogen with iodine, and
as the latter no more than phosphorus contains water, we ought
to admit that the hydrogen has taken its origin from the phos
phorus, and that the reddish-brown residue, after being washed
and dried, is de-hydrogenated phosphorus.        This conclusion is
 also confirmed by the circumstance, that the new iodine, heated
with the residue, gives no longer hydro-iodic acid. According to
this result, phosphorus   is,
                            like sulphur, hydrine and not simple
                                              a                   a

the former condenses it.    The produce of this operation    iron
alloyed with manganese, and a lamellated friable matter, which

    is of  a blackish -gray colour, and has the metallic lustre.   This
    is carbonion united with a little iron and manganese, from which
    we may separate it by a long-continued digestion with aqua regia
    and muriatic acid.     The sulphur does not take the latter metals
   from the fire ; which proves that they are chemically combined
    with the carbonion.
        In the course of my lecture yesterday I tried to produce bo-
   rium by treating borax with charcoal, and the experiment com
   pletely succeeded.      I mixed 220 grains of calcined borax with
    1 8 grains of very fine charcoal,  and I kept this mixture for two
    hours at a red heat in a gun-barrel. There was produced a blac^
   fused mass ; which after having been washed with water, and
   afterwards dried, left a deep olive-coloured powder, which Had
   all the characters and all the properties ascribed by Davy to bo-
   rium.
        I discovered nearly two months since    a new  sparkling pyro-
   phorus, which preserves its property of shining for a long time,
   and which may serve as a portable match. We obtain it by cal
   cining during an hour at a gentle red heat, and in a gun barrel,
   a mixture of one part of calcined alum, and two parts of subcar-
   bonate of potash, and from one-half to a whole part of lamp
   black. This pyrophorus seems to be composed of potassion and
   sulphuret of carbonion.      I also met the sulphuret of carbonion
  in the liver-formed ore of mercury of Idria, as may be seen in
   Schweiger's Journal.
       I have also recently discovered    that the muriate of lead of
  Derbyshire      is composed of phosphoric acid and of lead, and that
   the ceta camil of Peru consists of chloric acid and copper.
        M. Dulong, continuing the researches of Thomson, has found
  that the oxalic acid in uniting warm with the oxides of zinc or
  lead, allows 0*20 to escape of its weight in water : the oxalates
  resulting from it do not afterwards yield in their decomposition
  in the dry way any thing but gaseous oxide of carbon, carbonic
  acid, and the oxide of the metal.      M. Dulong asks if these salts
  are carbonites or carbonates of reduced metal ? He thinks they
  are the latter.      The oxalates of other metals -do not give out
  any water except at a very strong heat ; afterwards they yield
  carbonic acid ; no oxide of carbon, but, in lieu of it, the metal
  reduced : and the oxalates of soluble earth give out, under the
  action of heat, empyreumatic oil, water, oxide of carbon, car
  bonated hydrogen, carbonic acid, carbon, and sub-carbonate.
  We see that these differences depend on the retentive forces or
  on the energy of the oxides which form the bases of the salts.
       It is long since I asserted that the vegetable acids were hy
  drates, sub-hydrates, or super-hydrates of carbonous acid. Th»
  acid exists no more in the uncombined state than the oxide of

sulphur, and it resolves, on being isolated, into complete acid
and oxide ; as the oxide of sulphur resolves itself into sulphur
and sulphurous acid ; and we may rigorously suppose that the
one is a combination of carbonic acid with the oxide of carbon,
and the other a combination of sulphurous acid with sulphur,
formed both into salts.         The weak oxides merely retain the
carbonous acid long enough to strip it of its water, and after
wards they give up their oxygen to             which it,  saturated into
                                                                       is
carbonic acid.      The strongest oxides separate         instantly from
                                                                       it

well as its water, allow its oxygen to concentrate into           portion         is a

                      is                            by

ciple may form carbonated hydrogen and empyreumatic oil.
M. Dulong was thinking of my metallofluores and metallochlores
when he supposed         possible that reduced metals could be united

of Dulong show that the oxides in the carbonates are propor

pass through the lower sieve are so charged with the soluble
matter, that they are as thick as syrup, and the remaining por
tions have neither taste nor colour. Quassia, for instance, is
obtained at first in its consistence of extract, and what comes
afterwards has no taste.      The colouring matters with their ap
propriate solvents are also taken up at once. The extractive
matter of tea, coffee, and hops fall off in such a state of concen
tration, that they may be kept for years without spoiling.       They
are of course to be diluted with water for use. With a bottle of
this extract in one's pocket, it is only necessary to have boiling
water, milk and sugar, to make good tea or coffee, which have
all their colouring virtues, and have not lost a particle of aroma.
If an extract is wanted by means of any other menstruum than
water, for instance by alcohol, by alkaline liquor, acid, or oil,,
the organic substance must be impregnated with them, and
water poured in above. These liquids saturated with the soluble
substance pass through without the smallest portion of water
being mixed with them.          Pounded almonds are obtained in
thin oil ; and, when the water passes, it is of a red colour. For
the oils which freeze, the temperature must not be too low.          In
short, every substance which ought not to be elaborated by heat,
or what we may call boiled, is obtained speedily and commo-
diously by this apparatus, which may be called a dissolving press.
 Its application is universal, and its results will be curious ; it will
furnish every substance free from alteration by heat, with sub-
composition, supercomposition,       or decomposition : the analysis
of organic substances will be perfected and facilitated by          it,

   " The    Governor desires to communicate. for the information
of the public, the result of his late tour over the Western or Blue
Mountains, undertaken for the purpose of being enabled per
sonally to appreciate the importance of the tract of country ly
ing westward of them; which had been explored in the latter
end of the year 1813 and beginning of 1814 by Mr. George
William Evans, deputy surveyor of lands.
   "  To those who know how very limited a tract of country has
been hitherto occupied by the colonists of New South Wales,
extending along the eastern coast to the north and south of
Port Jackson only 80 miles, and westward about 40 miles to the
foot of that chain of mountains in the interior which forms its.,
western boundary, it must be a subject of astonishment and re
gret, that amongst so large a population no one appeared within
the first 25 years of the establishment of this settlement possessed
of sufficient energy of mind to induce him fully to explore a pas
sage over these mountains : — but, when it is considered that for
the greater part of that time even this circumscribed portion of
country afforded sufficient produce for the wants of the people,
whilst on the other hand the whole surface of the country be
yond those limits was a thick and in many places nearly an im
penetrable forest, the surprise at the want of effort to surmount
such difficulties must abate very considerably.
   " The records of the colony only afford two instances of any
bold attempt having been made to discover the country to the
westward of the Blue Mountains. — The first was by Mr. Bass,
and the other by Mr. Calcy, and both ended in disappointment —
a circumstance which will not be much wondered at by those
who have lately crossed those mountains.
   " To Gregory Blaxland and William Wentworth, esquires, and
Lieutenant Lawson} of the Royal Veteran Company, the merit

                          New South Wales.                      215)
is doe of having, with extraordinary patience and much fatigue,
effected the first passage over the most rugged and difficult part
of the Blue Mountains.
     " The governor, being strongly impressed with the importance
 of the object, had, early after his arrival in this colony, formed
the resolution of encouraging the attempt to find a passage to
the western country, and willingly availed himself of the facilities
which the discoveries of these three gentlemen afforded him.
 Accordingly, on the 20th of November 1813 he (intrusted the
 accomplishment of this object to Mr. George William Evans,
 deputy surveyor of lands, the result of whose journey was laid
 before the public, through the medium of the Sydney Gazette,-
 on the 12th of February 1814.
     "  The favourable account given by Mr. Evans of the country
 he had explored, induced the governor to cause a road to be
 constructed for the passage and conveyance of cattle and pro
 visions to the interior ; and men of good character, from amongst
 a number of convicts who had volunteered their services, were
 selected to perform this arduous work, on condition of being
fed and clothed during the continuance of their labour, and
 being granted emancipations as their final reward on the com
 pletion of the work.
     " The direction and superintendence of this great work was
 intrusted to William Cox, esq. the chief magistrate at Windsor;
 and to the astonishment of every one who knows what was to be
 encountered, and sees what has been done, he effected its com
 pletion in six months from the time of its commencement, hap
 pily without the loss of a man, or any serious accident.       The
 governor is at a loss to appreciate fully the services rendered by
 Mr. Cox to this colony, in the execution of this arduous work,
 which promises to be of the greatest public utility, by opening
 a new source of wealth to the industrious and enterprising.
 When it is considered that Mr. Cox voluntarily relinquished the
 comforts of his own house, and the society of his numerous fa
 mily, and exposed himself to much personal fatigue, with only
 such temporary covering as a bark hut could afford from the in
  clemency of the season, it is difficult to express the sentiments
  of approbation to which such privations and services are en
  titled.
      Mr. Cox having reported the road    as completed on the 21st
 of January, the governor,    accompanied by Mrs. Macquarie and
 that gentleman, commenced his tour on the 25th of April last,
 over the Blue Mountains, and was joined by Sir John Jamieson
  at the Nepean, who accompanied him during the entire tour. —
  The following gentlemen composed the governor's suite : Mr.
  Campbell, sectretary; Capt, Antill, major of brigade      ; Lieut.
                                                              Watts,

Watts, aid-de-camp; Mr. Redfern, assistant surgeon; Mr,
Oxley, surveyor general ; Mr. Meehan, deputy surveyor general;
Mr. Lewin, painter and naturalist; and Mr. G. W. Evans, de
puty surveyor of lands, who had been sent forward for the pur
pose of making further discoveries, and rejoined the party on the
day of arrival at Bathurst Plains.
    " The commencement of the ascent from Emu Plains to the
first depdt, and thence to a resting place, now called Spring
Wood, distant 12 miles from Emu Ford, was through a very
handsome open forest of lofty trees, and much more practicable
and easy than was expected.     The facility of the ascent for this
distance excited surprise, and is certainly not well calculated to
give the traveller a just idea of the difficulties he has afterwards
to encounter. — At a further distance of four miles a sudden
change is perceived in the appearance of the timber and the
quality of the soil — the former becoming stunted, and the latter
barren and rocky.       At this place the fatigues of the journey may
be said to commence.           Here the country became altogether
mountainous,      and extremely rugged. — Near to the 18th mile
mark    (it   to be observed that the measure commences from Emu
              is
Ford)   a pile  of stones attracted attention:     it  close to the line
                                                        is
of road, on the top of rugged and abrupt ascent, and
                           a                                      is
                                                                   sup
posed to have been placed there         by Mr. Caley, as the extreme
limit of his tour — hence the governor gave that part of the
                   :
mountain the name of Caley's Repulse.             To have penetrated
even so far, was at that time an effort of no small difficulty. —
From hence, forward to the 26th mile,         is a succession of steep
and rugged hills, some of which are almost so abrupt as to deny
s  passage altogether  ;   but at this place  a considerably extensive
plain   isarrived at, which constitutes the summit of the Western
Mountains; and from thence a most extensive and beautiful
prospect presents itself on all sides to the eye.          The town of
Windsor, the river Hawkesbury, Prospect Hill, and other objects
within that part of the colony now inhabited, of equal interest,
are distinctly seen from hence. — The majestic grandeur of the
situation, combined with the various objects to be seen from this
 place, induced the governor to give         itthe appellation of The
 King's Table Land. — On the SW. side of the King's Table Land
the mountain terminates in abrupt precipices of immense depth,
 at the bottom of which     is  seena  glen, as romantically beautiful
as  can  be  imagined,   bounded    on the further side      by
                                                             mountains
 of great magnitude, terminating equally abruptly as the others        ;
and the whole thickly covered with timber.          The length of this
 picturesque and remarkable tract of country           about 24 miles,
                                                        is
 to which the governor gave the name of The Prince Regent's
 Glen.— Proceeding hence to the 33d mile on the top of            a hill,
                                                                       an

 an opening presents itself on the S W. side of die Prince Regent's
 Glen, from whence a view is obtained particularly beautiful and
.grand — mountains rising beyond mountains, with stupendous
 masses of rock in the fore-ground,           here strike the eye with ad
 miration and astonishment.            The circular form in which the
 whole is so wonderfully disposed, induced the governor to give
 the name of Pitt's Amphitheatre (in honour of the late right
 honourable William Pitt) to this offset or branch from the Prince
 Regent's Glen. The road continues from hence, for the space
 of 17 miles, on the ridge of the mountain which forms one side
 of the Prince Regent's Glen, and there it suddenly terminates in
 nearly a perpendicular precipice of 676 feet high, as ascertained
 by measurement.         The road constructed by Mr. Cox down this
 rugged     and tremendous     descent, through all its windings, is no
 less than three-fourths of a mile in length, and has been exe
cuted with such skill and stability as reflects much credit on him.
 The labour here undergone, and the difficulties surmounted, caa
 only be appreciated by those who view this scene. In order to
 perpetuate the- memory of Mr. Cox's services, the governor
 deemed it a tribute justly due to him, to give his name to this
  grand and extraordinary pass ; and he accordingly called it
 Cox's Pass.       Having descended into the valley at the bottom
 of this pass, the retrospective view of the overhanging mountain
 is magnificently grand.         Although the present pass is the only
 practicable point yet      discovered  for descending by, yet themoun-
.tain is   much   higher than those on either side of           it,
                                                              from whence

 royal highness the duke of York. .                                     ..

     " On descending Cox's Pass, the governor was much gratified
  by  the appearance of good pasture land and soil fit for cultiva
 tion, which was the first he had met with since the commence
 ment of his tour.        The valley at the base of Mount York he
 called The Vale of Clwyd, in consequence of the strong re
 semblance        bore to the vale of that name in North Wales.
                 it                                                     The

  a rivulet of fine water runs along         it  from the eastward, which
•unites itself at the western extremity of the vale with another
  rivulet containing still more water. — The junction of these two
  streams forms      very handsome rivet, now called

country through which it passes, that it must be one of the prin
cipal causes of the floods which have been occasionally felt on the
low banks of the river Hawkesbury, into which the Nepean dis
charges itself.  The vale of Clwyd, from the base of Mount York,
extends six miles in a westerly direction, and has its termination
at Cox's River.    Westward of this river the country again be
comes hilly, but is generally open forest land, and very good
pasturage.
     "Three miles to the westward of the Vale of Clwyd, Messrs.
Blaxland, Wentworth, and Lawson had formerly terminated their
excursion ; and when the various difficulties are considered which
they had to contend with, especially until they had effected the
descent from Mount York, to which place they were obliged to
pass through a thick brush-wood, where they were under the
necessity of cutting a passage for their baggage-horses, the se
verity of which labour had seriously affected their healths, their
patient endurance of such fatigue cannot fail to excite much
surprise and admiration. — In commemoration of their merits,
three beautiful high hills joining each other at the end of their
tour at this place, have received their names in the following
order ; viz. — Mount Blaxland, Wentworth 's Sugar            Loaf,,
and Lawson's Sugar Loaf.         A range of very lofty hills and
narrow valleys alternately, form the tract of country from Cox's
River, for a distance of 16 miles, until the Fish River is arrived
at ; and the stage between these rivers is consequently very se
vere and oppressive on the cattle.          To this range the governor
gave   the  name  of  Clarence    Hilly Range.
     "Proceeding from the Fish River, and at a short distance
from      it,very singular and heautiful mountain attracts the at
                a
tention, its summit being crowned with       a     large and very extra
ordinary-looking rock, nearly circular in form, which gives to
the whole very much the appearance of         a    hill fort, such as are
frequent   in India. — To   this lofty hill Mr. Evans, who was the first
European discoverer, gave the name of Mount Evans.                Passing
on from hence the country continues hilly, but affords good
pasturage, gradually improving to Sidmouth Valley, which              is
distant from the pass of the Fish River eight miles.           The land
here     level, and
          is         the first  met  with   unencumbered with timber   :
it   not of very considerable extent, but abounds with a great
     is
variety of herbs and plants, such as would probably highly in
terest and gratify the scientific botanist. — This beautiful little
valley runs north-west and south-east, between hills of easy
ascent, thinly covered with timber. — Leaving Sidmouth Valley,
the country becomes again hilly, and in other respects resembles
very much the country to the eastward of the valley for sotne

Sidmouth Valley, the governor was highly gratified by the ap
pearance of the country, which there began to exhibit an open
an extensive view of gently rising grounds and fertile plains.—
Judging from the height of the banks, and its general width, the
Campbell River must be on some occasions of very considerable
magnitude ; but the extraordinary drought which has apparently
prevailed on the western side of the mountains, equally as through
 out this colony for the last three years, has reduced this river so
 much that it may be more properly called a chain of pools than
 a running stream at the present time.      In the reaches or pools of
 the Campbell River, the very curious animal called the paradox, or
 water-mole, is seen in great numbers.        The soil on both banks
 is uncommonly rich, and the grass is consequently luxuriant. —
 Two miles to the southward of the line of road which crosses
 the Campbell River, there is a very fine rich tract of low lands,
 which has been named Mitchell Plains. Flax was found here
 growing in considerable quantities. — The Fish River, which
 forms a junction with the Campbell River a few miles to the
  northward of the road and bridge over the latter, has also two
 very fertile plains on its banks, the one called O'Connell Plains,
  and the other Macquarie Plains, both of considerable extent,
  and very capable of yielding all the necessaries of life.
     ** At the distance of seven miles from the
                                                      bridge over the
  Campbell River, Bathurst Plains open to the view, presenting a
  rich tract of champaign country of 1 1 miles in length, bounded
  on both sides by gently rising and very beautiful hills, thinly
  wooded. The Macquarie River, which is constituted by the junc
  tion of the Fish and Campbell River, takes a winding course
  through the plains, which can be easily traced from the high
  lands adjoining, by the particular verdure of the trees on its
  banks, which are likewise the only trees throughout the extent
  of the plains. — The level and clean surface of these plains gives
  them at first view very much the appearance of lands in a state
  of cultivation.
      " It is impossible to behold this grand scene without a feeling
  of admiration and surprise, whilst the silence and solitude which
  reign in a space of such extent and beauty as seems designed bv
   Nature for the occupancy and comfort of man, create a degree
   of melancholy in the mind which may be more easily imagined
   than described.
      " The governor and suite arrived at these plains on Thursdav
   the 4th of May, and encamped on the southern or left bank of
   the Macquarie River — the situation being selected in consequence
   of its commanding a beautiful and extensive prospect for manv
   miles in every direction around it. — At this place the governor
   remained for a week, which time he occupied in making excur-

sions in different directions through the adjoining country* on
both sides of the river.
    " On Sunday, the 7th of May, the governor fixed on a site
suitable for the erection of a town at some future period, to which
he gave the name of Bathurst, in honour of the present secre
tary of state for the colonies. — The situation of Bathurst is
elevated sufficiently beyond the reach of any floods which may
occur, and is at the same time so near to the river on its south
bank as to derive all the advantages of its clear and beautiful
stream.    The mechanics and settlers of whatever description who
may be hereafter permitted to form permanent residences to
themselves at this place, will have the highly important advan
tages of a rich and fertile soil, with a beautiful river flowing
through      it,
              for all the uses of man.    The governor must how
ever add, that the hopes which were once so sanguinely enter
tained, of this river becoming navigable to the Western Sea, have
ended in disappointment.
    " During the week that the governor remained at Bathurst,
he made daily excursions in various directions    :   one of these ex
tended 22 miles in a south-west direction, and on that occasion,
as well as on all the others, he found the country composed
chiefly of valleys and plains, separated occasionally     by ranges of
low hills — the soil throughout being generally fertile, and well
            ;
circumstanced for the purpose of agriculture or grazing.
   "  The governor here feels much pleasure in being enabled to
communicate to the public, that the favourable reports which he
had received of the country to the west of the Blue Mountains
have not been        any means exaggerated, — the difficulties which
                       by
present themselves in the journey from hence are certainly great
and inevitable     jbut those persons who may be inclined to be
come permanent settlers there, will probably content themselves
with visiting this part of the colony but rarely, and of course will
have them seldom to encounter. — Plenty of water and           a  suffi
ciency of grass are to be found in the mountains for the support
of such cattle as may be sent over them and the tracts of fer
                                              ;
tile soil and rich pasturage which the new country affords, are
fully extensive enough for any increase of population, and stock
which can possibly take place for many years.
  "   Within distance of ten miles from the site of Bathurst,
                   a
there  is not less than fifty thousand acres of land clear of timber,
and fully one half of that may be considered excellent soil, well
calculated for cultivation.     It   ismatter of regret, that in pro
                                          a
portion as the soil improves the timber degenerates      ;   and   it   is
to be remarked, that every where to the westward of the moun
tains  it   much inferior both in size and quality to that within
            is
the present colony: there      is,however,   sufficiency of timber of
                                              a

purposes of house-building and husbandry.
    "The governor has here to lament, that neither coals nor lime
stone have been yet discovered in the western country; articles
in themselves of so much importance, that the want of them
must be severely felt whenever that country shall be settled.
    " Having enumerated the principal and most important fea
tures of this new country, the governor has now to notice some
of its live productions.      All around Batburst abounds in a va
riety of game ; and the two principal rivers contain a great
quantity of fish, but all of one denomination, resembling the
perch in appearance, and of a delicate and fine flavour, not un
like that of a rock cod : this fish grows to a large size, and is
very voracious.      Several of them were caught during the gover
nor's stay at Bathurst, and at the halting-place on the Fish Ri
ver.     One of those caught weighed 17 lbs. and the people sta
tioned at Bathurst reported that they had caught some weighing
 25 lbs.
    " The field game are the kangaroos, emus, black swans, wild
geese, wild turkeys, bustards, ducks of various kinds, quail,
bronze, and other pigeons, &c.&c. The water- mole, or paradox,
also abounds in all the rivers and ponds.
    " The site designed for the town of Bathurst, by observation
taken at the flag-staff, which was erected on the day of Bathurst
receiving that name, is situated in latitude 33° 24' 30" south,
and in longitude 1495 37' 45" east of , Greenwich, being also
271 miles north of Government-house in Sydney, and 94$ west
of  it,   bearing west 20° 30" north, 83 geographic miles, or 95£
statute miles ;    the measured road distance from Sydney to
Bathurst being HO English miles.
   "   The road constructed   by   Mr. Cox and the party under him
commences at Emu Ford, on the left bank of the river Nepeati,
and    isthence carried 101

road has been carefully measured, and each mile regularly marked
on the trees growing on the left side of the road proceeding to
wards Bathurst.
   "   The governor in his tour made the following stages, in
which he was principally regulated    by  the consideration of having
good pasturage for the cattle,    and  plenty of water
                                                     :

        On Thursday the 11th of May the governor and suite set
  out from Bathurst on their return, and arrived at Sydney on
  Friday the 19th ultimo.
     " The governor deems it expedient here to notify to the publie,
  that he does not mean to make any grants of land to the west-*-
  ward of the Blue Mountains until he shall receive the commands
  of i His Majesty's ministers on that subject, and in reply to the
  report he is now about to make them upon it.
     " In the mean time, such gentlemen or other respectable free
  persons as may wish to visit this new country, will be permitted
  to do so on making a written application to the governor to that
  effect ; who will order them to be furnished with written passes.
'
  It is at the same time strictly ordered and directed, that no per
  son, whether civil or military, shall attempt to travel over the
  Blue Mountains without having previously applied for and ob
  tained permission, in the above prescribed form.       The military
  guard stationed at the first depot on the mountains will receive
  full instructions to prevent the progress of any persons who shaH
  not have obtained regular passes.       The necessity for the esta
  blishing and strictly enforcing this regulation is too obvious to
  every one who will reflect on it, to require any explanation here.
     " The governor cannot conclude this account of his tour,
  without offering his best acknowledgements to William Cox, esq.
  for the important service he has rendered to the colony in so
  short a period of time, by opening a passage to the new-dis
  covered country, and at the same time assuring him, that he
  shall have great pleasure in recommending his meritorious ser
  vices on this occasion to the favourable consideration of His
  Majesty's Ministers.

     M. Orfila has continued his interesting researches upon poi
  sons.    According to the second part of his work now published,
  he does not consider opium as a narcotic or a stimulant, but as
  exercising an action completely sui generis.       With respect to
  the Solarium nigrum, M. Orfila does not think it is poisonous
  at all ; and adds, that the Belladonna must have been the dele
  terious plant mistaken for it by authors.
     With respect to the effects of poison from narcotics, as* thev
  have been called, M. Orfila observes that authors have pre
  scribed the vegetable acids, coffee, camphor, water, chlorine,
                                                                   and

 and bleeding.       M. Orfila has proved, however, 1. That the
 vegetable   acids  constantly hasten death, when they exist in the
 stomach along with the narcotic, which is owing to the acids
 forming the solution of the poison, and consequently its absorp
 tion.    (There are ten experiments to verify this fact.) 2. That
 acidulated water was very useful for combating the effects of
 narcotics, when they had been previously rejected by vomiting :
 thus animals which would have died infallibly at the end of an
 hour, were saved by administering to them night and day, for
 twenty-four or thirty-six hours, several doses of water soured by
 a little vinegar : those which were nearly revived by the end of
 the day, and which had been neglected during the night, died
for want of assistance.         3. That a strong infusion of coffee is
 an antidote to the effects of poison by means of narcotics, and
 the animals to which it was administered night and day reco
 vered.    4. That the decoction of coffee is much less energetic
 than the infusion.      5. That camphor is not the counterpoison
 to narcotics, but that it may be administered in small doses to
 diminish their effects.      6. That water and mucilaginous pre
 parations,  so far from  being useful, hasten the approach of death,
 because they     favour   the absorption of the poison.     7. That
 bleeding was never injurious, and that it was frequently sufficient
 to operate the revival of plethoric animals, which would never
 theless have died two or three days afterwards, if they had not
-been attended to : and lastly, that it is best always to open the
jugular vein. 8. That chlorine acts nearly like the vegetable
 acids.
    M. Orfila has announced his intention to compare the effects
 of the poisonous plants of Africa and the South of Europe, with
 those which he has obtained in France.          He is also collecting
 materials for a work, in which he means to show in what cases
 the fluids of living animals are deranged, become venomouSj and
 the diseases which they produce.

     M.Vogel has analysed the brick-dust sediment of the human
urine, known by the appellation of the rosacic acid. This substance
has not been found in the urine of a healthy person by M. Vogel,
although M. Proust was of a contrary opinion.          The former
observes : — " I never found that this red substance was formed
previous to or during the state of fever ; it always began to make
its appearance at the period when the crisis was completely past.
Recently I had an opportunity of procuring a considerable quan
tity of this substance. A friend who is subject to gouty attacks
voided this kind of urine during fifteen davs, and collected the
red powder for me by filtration.      Cold water has no effect on
it, but boiling water dissolves       completely.   The solution

  . a long time even in sulphurous acid, anil without the latter losing
    its peculiar smell.     When the rosacic acid is dried, which has
    been in contact with the sulphurous acid, it yields a very fine
    carmine colour.      When nitric acid at 32' is poured on the ro
    sacic acid, there is immediately a considerable swelling up, and
i   a brisk effervescence of nitrous gas ; the red powder disappears,
    and a yellowish white substance is formed.        On boiling the li
    quor, the whole is dissolved, and there remain, by a slow evapo
    ration, red scales perfectly similar to those which are obtained
    by treating the uric acid with nitric acid.        According to M.
    Proust, by pouring nitric acid on this acid a considerable quan
    tity of carbonic acid gas is liberated.    Since the nitric acid only
    can produce such an effervescence, the extrication of the car
    bonic acid and of the nitrous gas can only be ascribed to a reci
    procal decomposition which the rosacic acid and the nitric acid
    exercise on each other.      The simple muriatic acid does not ap
    pear   to have  a sensible action on the rosacic. acid ; the powder
    remains in it diluted, without losing its intensity of colour, and
    it is only after a few days that it becomes fawn-coloured.        The
    oxy-muriatic acid discolours the red colour very speedily, and
    makes it yellow.
       " Water charged with sulphurated hydrogen has no kind of
    action on the rosacic acid.       These two substances may remain
    together for fifteen days without undergoing any change. Never
    theless, after a longer time the red powder disappears entirelv,
    and the liquor acquires a putrid ammoniacal smell.

    lution of caustic potash, the powder immediately acquires a
    brownish cglour, and abundance of ammonia is liberated.          This
    combination of rosacic acid and of potash is very soluble in
     water.
        " The aeids,precipitate from it a powder of a yellow colour ; and
    it would seem as if the rosacic acid by its union with potash had
    already undergone a kind of decomposition ; at least I have not
    been able to reproduce it by means of an acid with its primitive
    red colour.     Liquid ammonia left in contact during some hours
     with the rosacic acid converts it into a fine yellow powder. The
    ammonia is combined in this yellow powder in the state of salt
    with the rosacic acid, and this salt is more soluble in water than
    the rosacic acid itself.    The rosacic acid is precipitated in a yel
    low powder from the aqueous solution of this salt with a base of
    ammonia.      On sprinkling the rosacic acid with a concentrated
    solution  of nitrate of silver, the powder loses its colour in a few
     hours and becomes bottle green.       The pure nitric acid diluted
    in a solution of nitrate of silver also assumes after some time a
    brownish aspect.      The nitrate of mercury and muriate of tia

M. Vogel concludes., with the exception of the circumstance of
colour, and of the action of the sulphurous and sulphuric acids,
that the rosacic acid does not differ essentially from the uric
acid ; and nature, in changing the one into the other, makes no
great effort."
                      PHOSPHATE OF ALUMINE.
     M. Vauquelin has published in the Annates           de Chimie the
following     brief note on the phosphate        of alumine : — " The
method      hitherto regarded as the best for separating the phos
phoric acid from iron, with which it is frequently mixed in the
ores, consists in fusing the latter with potash, &c. ; but if there
is at the same time alumine in these ores, it is also dissolved in
the alkali, and -is found united to the phosphoric acid when we
precipitate the latter, and increases the quantity of it.          This
 alumine might make us believe in the presence of the phos
 phoric acid, even when it does not exist, if we do not examine
 the precipitate with attention.
     " If the alumine exists with the phosphoric acid in an ore of
 iron, it is evident that these two bodies will be dissolved in the
 potash, will be precipitated from it when we saturate the alkali
 precisely by an acid, and will be redissolved together by an ex
 cess of acid.     If we add lime water in order to precipitate the
 phosphoric acid, the alumine will be also precipitated ; but if we
 treat the precipitate when still moist by a solution of potash, it
 will not be completely dissolved; and this will be the proof of the
 existence of the phosphoric acid: otherwise the solution would
 take place completely.
     " This method appears to me the most certain, not only for
 ascertaining the presence of the phosphoric acid in iron ores,
 but also for estimating the quantity of it. In fact, we cannot
 analyse the phosphate of alumine either by the alkalies or the car
 bonates : the former dissolve the entire combination, the others-
 dissolve it in part; in such a way, however, that there is a greater
  quantity of phosphoric acid in the part dissolved than in that
 which is not.     1 ascertained this in the following    way : I boiled
 a certain quantity of phosphate of alumine with a solution of
 carbonate of potash.      I filtered the liquor in order to separate it
 from the undissolved portion, and I saturated with acetic acid
  the excess of the carbonate of potash : there was formed a pre
  cipitate, which was phosphate of alumine.         I afterwards put an
  excess of acid in the liquor, and I assured myself that in this
  state it was not precipitated by ammonia ; a proof that it did
  not contain any more phosphate cf alumine : but it had been
  precipitated by lime water; which proves that the alkali had di
                                                                   vided

              , Analysis  of the Bark of the Malambo.            231
Tided the phosphate of alumine into super-sulphate which it had
dissolved, and into sub-sulphate which it left.      We may besides
distinguish pure alumine from the phosphate with this base :
the alumine is transparent, and as it were gelatinous ; the phos
phate on the contrary is opaque white : but this quality does
not always announce the presence of the phosphoric acid .in
alumine, for silex and lime give it this opaque aspect.
    " Although ammonia does not perceptibly dissolve pure alu
mine, it dissolves a great quantity of phosphate of alumine. which
it shares, like the carbonates, both into super- and sub-sulphate."
    M. Vauquelin has analysed the bark of the South American
plant called the malambo, brought to Europe by Messrs. Hum
boldt and Bonpland.         It had been strongly recommended as a
febrifuge, and of service as a substitute for the Peruvian hark
now in use.      M. Vauquelin finds the malambo bark to contain :
 1. a volatile aromatic oil; 2. a very bitter resin ; 3. an extract
soluble in water.       The resin is of a reddish brown, dry, and
shining in its fracture : when put into the mouth it seems to be
at first tasteless, but some time afterwards its bitterness is de
veloped in a very striking manner: it is very soluble, particularly
in warm alcohol, and its solution is abundantlv precipitated by
water; it is not soluble *in the alkalies.       When placed upon a
warm body, it is dispersed almost entirely in smoke which has
the smell of incense. When subjected to the operation of heat
 in close vessels, lit furnished an acid water and a thick oil the
 smell of which was not agreeable, and some charcoal.
    The extract is of a yellowish brown colour : its fracture is
shining when dry, but it becomes soft in the air ; it is not bitter
if it is well washed in alcohol : it is viscous and gluey when hu
mid. When subjected to- heat in close vessels this extract fur
bishes a brown oil, a watery mixture which reddens turnsole, and
from which potash nevertheless liberates ammonia in a very
sensible manner.       The chareoal remaining in the retort, when
burnt in a platina crucible left some very alkaline ashes, and
which furnished by lixiviation a considerable quantity of sub-
carbonate of potash of a green colour, similar to that of certain
potashes of commerce.         This colour is owing to manganese, for
by saturating this alkali by the muriatic acid the combination
assumed a very fine red colour.          This alkali certainly comes
from some salts insoluble in aleohol, such as the tartrate, citrate,
or oxalate of potash.
    The volatile oil is slightly citrine, lighter than water, of a
smell which seems at once to resemble pepper and thyme : it is
slightly soluble in water, to which it communicates its smell and
its pungent taste : it is verv soluble in alcohol.

232           Earthquake. -^Steam Engines in Cornwall.
     The bark«f the malambo when incinerated furnished yellowish
 white ashes, which were entirely dissolved with effervescence in
 the muriatic acid: the., ammouia precipitated from its solution
 a, little phosphate of lirne mixed with iron; the sulphuric      acid
afterwards poured    into this solution, and the latter evaporated to
dryness and calcined, gave abundance of sulphate of lime, a little
 sulphate of magnesia, and there was also a little silex         This
b.ark therefore contains the same principles as the vegetables of
Europe, and shows that the soil is nearly the same over the
globe, or at least that vegetables uniformly extract from it the
same substances.
    The most abundant principle in the malambo bark is the re
sin, since it forms one-fifth part of it.     In this resin the bitter
taste resides, and also the chief virtue of the bark.    The volatile
and aromatic oil which accompanies the bitter principle affords
room to hope that it may be employed as a tonic.          But the re
sin being very abundant and nauseously bitter, and the volatile
oil very acrid, the bark must be given at first in small doses and
with caution.     The form most advantageous for administering
it is that of tincture, mixed with syrup or water and sugar.
             EARTHQUAKE AT THE ISLAND        OF MADEIRA.
    By letters from Madeira, dated on the 8th of February last, it
appears that there was a severe shock of an earthquake felt
there on the 2d of February.       The shock was very violent, and
lasted four or five minutes, according to different persons.        It
threw down the cross of one of the parish churches, of which
the walls were also shaken.       Other churches and houses were
damaged in various parts of the island. What appears more sin
gular is, that on the 5th of February an American vessel arrived,
the captain of which related, that on the 2d, about one o'clock
in the morning, being then about 300 miles from the Azores, and
700 miles from Madeira, his vessel sustained a shock as severe as
if it had struck on a rock. The crew were greatly alarmed, and
the captain sounded immediately, but found no bottom. He was
perfectly at a loss how to account for this extraordinary circum
stance, uniil after his arrival at Madeira.

        Sir, — We   have   had the great changeability of the weather
    during the greatest part of the year' in the south of England, so
    frequently alluded to by meteorologists, that it may be worth
    while to notice, previous to the regular journal of the weather
    which I subjoin, that the inhabitants of this city say they do irot
    remember to have had so changeable a season for manv years.
    Since my arrival here on the 23d of February, the atmosphere
     has been constantly changing ; clear frost, snow, rain, and the
     heat of 50° of Fahrenheit, all in the space of twenty-four hours.
     I regret that the multiplicity of other employments has prevented
     me from keeping a register of the weather, till the 12th instant.
         March 12. — Rapidly succeeding but gentle showers with clear
     intervals, and gale from the westward, with temperate atmo
     sphere of about 50° at the maximum.
         March 13. — Very clear morning, followed about noon by
     snow showers, and wind in gales.       Fine clear moon-light night,
     and gentle stratus near the ground.
         March 14. — A frost, which came' on in the night; all the
     ground hard ; the sky was obscure with haze, and at the same
      time gentle wind.     Showers of snow and rain in the afternoon
     and night.     Staekencloud and wanecloud.
                                                                 March

 236           Meteorohgizal Observations at Edinburgh.
    March 15. — Obscure morning and colder; some light snow
 showers and a clear windy night.
    March 16. — Fine clear morning, but showers of snow and
 rain came in the afternoon.
    March 17. — Clear morning.              Wanecloud and other modifi
cations     were followed    about    noon   by showers of snow and rain
from the northward.           Travelling on to Stirling, I found the at
mosphere become much warmer.                  The sun came out, and the
 evening was mild and calm.              The snow lay on the mountains
-while the lower lands were warm.               I noticed stackenclouds or
 cumuli rising from behind the higher hills ; others seemed to
 sit upon them, and to preserve the cumulativeness of structure
just as when they, float upon the diurnal vapour plane.
    There seems to be the same almost constant tendency to pro
 duce rainclouds in these hilly regions hereabout, as I have be
fore noticed in those of Wales.            I have noticed also some other
circumstances common to the atmospheric phenomena of both
 countries, and which probably belong to mountainous districts
in general.      The rain does not generally fall in such large and
deluging streams as often happens in the flat countries of Eng
land. The interchange of sunny clearness and of showers is
more rapid, and the sondercloud* and -wanecloud* have not
usually such a well defined character.            This latter circumstance
1 cannot easily account for, except it be that the moister air of
these regions conducts off more readily the electric fluid from
the modifications, and thus weakens the specific cause of their
particular characters.           It can hardly be owing to the elevated
peaks    of  the mountains      approaching nearer to the clouds, as the
wanecloud sometimes preserves its form when lodging, or at
least in close apposition to the top of a mountain, in the same
manner as it does to a mountainous stackencloud, as noticed by
Aratus    :

    The constant windy state of Edinburgh have I often noticed on
the mountainous shores of England and Wales ; and in a number
of small balloons which were flying about over Edinburgh, I did
not notice any to get a second current, as was generally the
case in my experiments with balloons in England.                 I shall pro
ceed, with your permission, to communicate further observations
on the nepheology of this country in your next.

   Li.   On the Cosmogony    of Moses.      By Mr. Andrew Horn.
                            To   Mr. Tilhch.
 Sir, —•   The   researches" of geology have at length obtained for
 the cosmogony of Moses that attention which its intrinsic merit
always demanded. The pages of the Philosophical Magazine have
for several months past been occupied bv various disquisitions
upon the subject, particularly respecting the meaning of the
 term day.     But in none of them, I conceive, has the true sense
been elicited, as designating each of the six successive periods of
 the Genesis.    Dr. Prichard has indeed pointed out the tropical
 sense in the term period; but its particular application in the
 cosmogony presents a difficulty which the figurative construction
 cannot by any means remove.         Your correspondent F. E — -^s
has taken advantage of this, and stated his objections in lan
guage sufficiently explicit to show his estimate of the Genesis and
its author.
    After being long engaged in a work illustrative of the Mosaic
  Cosmogony, which is nearly finished, allow me to say, that the
results. I have obtained from my investigations differ materially
from those of all your correspondents upon this subject.         How
 ever, as I agree with Dr. Prichard in his estimation of the Ge
 nesis, before I offer any opinion upon the import of the term
day, as there used, I would observe, that although ' he does
 not' " place the author of the Pentateuch in the rank of com
mon compilers of historical fragments, possessed merelv of na
 tural intelligence," he can have little difficulty in escaping from
the dilemma, to which F. E              s imagines   he has reduced
him, in page ISO of your last number.           If certain events re
 corded in the Genesis are found to agree with what may be
 called universal tradition, and some of those events never could
have been conceived in any human mind without supernatural
 intelligence, this universal coincidence must, therefore, be re
 ferred to some common source.           But we are not to suppose
 Moses the first person to whom the communication was made.
 Obvious reasons might be urged, why this favour should have
 been granted to the great progenitor of mankind.          The notion
 of a beginning — that the universe once had no existence, most
 assuredly, is neither a dictate of reason nor a physical disco
 very.     Now there never was a fact, left to tradition, but what
 has been corrupted.      Was it possible, then, that the traditionarv
 account of the origin of the world should during a progress of
 3000 years have escaped corruption ? When the facts, there
fore, came to be recorded, they must have been so corrupted,

that nothing less than inspiration could have enabled Moses or
 any other man to separate truth from error, to supply what was
 lost, .and duly arrange the whole.
     I presume that it is scarcely possible to obtain a just con
 ception of any detached part or term in the Genesis, without
 previously knowing the author's principles.        And this cannot
 well be attained without some acquaintance with the original
 language.        Those in general who have possessed this requisite,
 have either twisted his expressions to countenance some precon
 ceived hypothesis, or, taking a superficial view of the cosmogony,
 pronounced the whole unphilosophical and vulgar.           After ma
  ture investigation,    I do not hesitate to say that the two grand
 principles of the cosmogony are aloms and a fluid.         Before we
  can, therefore, ascertain the sense of the word DV {day), we
  ought first to establish the meaning of the preceding term llNy
  commonly translated light.      From a collation of passages where-
  this word and its cognate terms occur, the ruling idea is, evi
  dently, that of fluidity.     The divine fiat for the existence of
  the Aw ought, therefore, to be rendered " Let a fluid be ;" light
  being only one of its properties.       Hence the term cether, so
  famous in the cosmogonies, and so ill defined in the systematic
  philosophy of the Greeks, is to be traced to the TiKii T\H (Ath-
  eaur) of the Mosaic cosmogony.
      It is a vulgar error to suppose the sun was not created until
  the fourth day.      Moses does not say that God created, but that
  he made, formed, or completed the sun in this period. According
  to the order of the narrative, the atomic masses of the earth and
  celestial bodies were brought into existence before the cether.
      Having premised these things, we are now prepared to explain
  a part of the Genesis which has not a little perplexed exposi
  tors, and will lead us to the true explanation of the term day,
  as there used.     Our common version reads, ver. 6 : " God di
  vided the light from the darkness."         But darkness is no real
  being; and it is an absurdity into which Moses never could have
  fallen, to represent the Creator dividing things necessarily di
  stinct. Now the difficulty is at once removed, by only supplying
  the word earth, the antecedent with which the passage evi
  dently stands connected ; thus literally,
                                              " And God divided [the
  earth) between the light and between the darkness." Hence the
  8pheroidity of the earth is not only here intimated; but, as a globe
  cannot possibly have one hemisphere enlightened and the other
  dark but by light proceeding from an opposite focus, we have
  also a direct proof that the sun existed at this period, and
  operated upon the earth by transmitting its fluid or light feebly
  indeed at first, for it did not produce its fall effect till the
fourth dav, when the Creator pronounced it "good/' or" fit
                                                                     to

  "to   regulate times and seasons :" so that from thenceforward
  they might be exactly calculated by its regular influence upon
  the motions of the earth.
     Time is measured by the motion of bodies ; and their velocity
  is quicker or slower according to the diameter of the rotatory
  body, and the quantity of force acting upon it.          The planet
  Jupiter takes only about ten hours to perform one revolution
  upon its axis, which comprises a morning and an evening, and
  astronomers call this a day.        The moon, again, employs about
  1600 hours in making one rotation upon her axis, comprising
 also a morning and an evening, and this period is denomi
 nated a day.      Hence also, in the phraseology of Moses, the term
 day,   in each  of  the successive periods of the Genesis, properly
 denotes one rotation of the earth upon its axis, without any re
 gard to the length or duration of the time ; for, as the motions
 of our earth have been from the first moment dependent upon
 the sun, its influence upon the earth was at fipst extremely weak.
  Hence the'diurnal rotation of the earth and progress in its orbit
 were then inconceivably slow ; but the velocity of both motions
 gradually increased till the end of the fourth day, when the sun
 was perfected.       The space of time, therefore, in each of the four
 first days or revolutions of the earth was of indefinite length, and
 each had " an evening and a morning." Hence these revolutions
 were true solar days: but every period or day differed from another ;
 because the rotatory velocity of the earth was continually ac
 celerated from the first moment till the end of the fourth day.
 The quantity of time therefore, or duration of any one preced
 ing minute, or hour, was greater than any that succeeded ; so
 that the first minute of the first day may have been equal, in
 duration or length of time, to a ynonth or a year, compared with
 the last minute of the fourth day, the rotatory velocity in this
 minute being so much quicker.             Thus it is evident that the
four first days or rotations of the earth were periods that dif
 fered in their length, and their duration is indefinite,

           It appears to have been first noticed by a Mr. Atkin
            son, and transmitted to the late Dr. Withering from
           Landscall Haws in Lancashire, where several acres of

       Sowerby's drawing is a good representation of the flower
         of this rose, as it mav be observed in the rich country

         less'luxuriant, and the petals arc of a deeper hue.

        of the specimen figured by Sowerby, and mentioned
        by Dillertius.    This 1 consider as nothing but a variety
         of the preceding species. Near Newcastle it is ex
         tremely common, its fruit varying from perfect smooth
        ness to a considerable degree of roughness, and the

       This rose, which is by no means rare in the north, and
         forms one of the chief ornaments of the woods and
         hedges south-west from Newcastle, appears to be ill-
         understood by the Swedish botanists.     The figure in
         English Botany represents the plant as flourishing in
         the south of England, and even about Darlington; but
         surely the prickles are too much hooked. — With us the

       Though the sweet-briar may occasionally be met with on

            pointed, doubly serrated, glaucous ; prickles hooked.
        This   is a much slenderer, though less trailing briar than
            the foregoing ; its flowers are pale pink, generally in
            pairs or single, and its fruit large.    From E. canina
           it further differs in habit by not having young shoots
            sprouting beyond the blossoms, so as to give them the
            appearance of being axillary.          To a rose named
            R. senhicosa by Acharius in the Stockholm Trans
            actions it seems more nearly allied than even to R. ca
           nina; but differs in the fruit being ovate, not globu
            lar, and the segments of its calyx less divided.      This
           was sent me by Dr. Swartz, with the following re
           mark : "R. canina proxima, sed fructits svlrotun-
           dus et acvlei rectiores."     I make no doubt the former
            has been often overlooked as a variety of the Dog
            Rose ; it also resembles R. ccesia of English Botany,
           t. 2367, but differs in many points, besides haying
            smooth, not downy leaves.       By Mr. Woods, a gentle
           man who has paid particular attention to this genus,
            I am likewise assured they are distinct.

           lish Botany, but the calyx is long permanent on the
           fruit. No doubt can exist of its being different from
            every other British species.       Like R. canina it fre

 Lin.    On Dr. Murrav's Opposition to Professor Prevost's
    Theory of Radiant Caloric; on Electrical Phenomena, and
   on Sir H. Davy's Saje Lamp.
                           To  Mr. Tittoch.
SlR,-D R.         Murray     has opposed the theory of Prevost oh
Radiant Heat.       He (Dr. M.) says that the polhhed metallk
surface of the canister containing a freezing mixture, when
placed in the foe us of a mirror, opposing another holding a ther
mometer, should depress the temperature more than the blackened
side of the canister, if this theory he true; but that the contrary
is the fact.
    It is accepted that a hlackeiied surface radiates heat more
copiously than when the metallic surface is unimpaired ; and it
is inferred by the Doctor from this circumstance, that heat ra--
<Iiating in greater quantity from the canister by means of the
black surface, should compensate more largely than the uncovered
surface for the loss of temperature sustained by the thermometer
in the opposing reflector.       Experiment, however, teaches that
the thermometer is less depressed by the clean metallic than the
painted surface, i. <?. there is a greater decrement of temperature
by the dark surface than by that which has an unclouded lustre.
   it must however he admitted, that the various colours absorb
heat differently; black surfaces exceeding them in this respect.
 Hence white unpolished surfaces absorb heat slower than those
that are blackened.      The decrement of temperature may be ac
counted for by presuming that the facilities of absorption are
in a more exalted ratio than the powers of radiation.
             Mr. Walker       on  Electrical Phcenomena.
   Your indefatigable    correspondent Mr. W., among his. quota
tions, refers to some experiments which do not tend to support the
views of which he is the advocate.        When aqueous vapour, it is
stated, passes through an ignited porcelain tube (lined with char
coal), hydrogen is formed. This is vol the case — A mixture of car
bonic acid and hydrogen, as might be naturally expected, passes
over into the recipient, forming hydro-carbonate.       It is difficult
to believe that pure carbonic acid gas can he obtained by passing
steam through a tube lined with carbonate barytes.        But grant
it true, I ean conceive that the quantum of heat employed may
serve to detach carbonic acid gas from the carbonate barytes, and
that this aeriform fluid may be found in the inverted vessel on
the pneumatic cistern — no doubt m company with aqueous
vapour — Th&t carbonic acid gas is formed in unlimited quantity
from a limited portion of carbonate barytes is incredible.         Mr.
 Walker might as well adduce the experiment as a proof             that

 Water was partly   if liot wholly carbonic acid gas. The fixed -air
 being displaced   from    the barvtes, the water will unite with the
 earth and form a hydrate.         In introducing the experiment of
  Sir H. Davy, your correspondent seems not aware of that of
 Dobereiner of Jena.        The former distinguished chemist in elec
 trifying too great a portion of mercury did not succed in amal
 gamating it : but it is of a piece with that of Dobereiner.      The
 latter, by using a minute portion of mercury in contact with
 water, and submitting it to the action of Voltaic electricity, found
 oxvgen developed at the positive wire, while no hydrogen evolved
 at the negative extremity : but the fluidity of the mercury was
 arrested, and a solid amalgam formed; and this amalgam when
 submitted to heat gave off hydrogen, while the mercury resumed
 its fluid form.     This would look as if hydrogen was a metal
 dissolved in caloric, and illustrates the electrization of ammonia
 associated with mercury — which phaenomenon admits of an easv
 solution, if we admit nitrogen to be a compound of oxygen and
 hydrogen, of which I see no cause to doubt.           I am not pre
 pared to sav that amalgamation with mercury is conclusive on
 the question of metallization — the experiments of Crosse would
 lead us to doubt it.
                Sir Humphrv Davv's         Safe-lamp.
     I am happy in adding my complete conviction        of the perfect
 safety  of this invaluable discovery.      It cannot be over-rated.
The triumphs of humanity in this instance are complete, and
will laud in grateful reminiscence the name of Davv.
    On Thursday (28th ultimo) I descended the " William" Pit
here, in company with that enlightened practical miner Mr.
Peele, when Sir H. Davy's safe -lamp was put to the severest
proof, in a recess of the most dangerous workings of the mine,
and where a candle would have proved certain destruction. We
only wanted the presence of Sir Humphry to have shared in our
admiration of the imposing spectacle.         The flame of the lamp
was first capt with a blueish flame, a lambent light was then
seen playing in ,the cylinder, and the flame of the fire-damp af
terwards enlarging filled the whole wire-gauze.        For some time
the flame of the wick could be discerned within the lucid at
mosphere of fire-damp, and then the whole was calmly extin
guished.     More brilliant results the friends of humanity could
scarcely have dared to hope for.       Sophistry is put to the blush.
Independent of experiments which I had myself nrade with the
safe-lamp, I placed implicit reliance von the manipulations of
this illustrious chemist; — my confidence has not been shaken,
nor have my expectations been deceived ; and my conviction is
now absolute.
                                                                   As

   Description   of the Menagerie at Schaenlrunn in Austria. 249
    As Sir H. Davy had recommended that the wire cylinder
should he oiled when not in use, to preserve from oxidation, it
was of importance to ascertain whether, should the flame of the
fire-damp from its intensity set fire to the oil on the internal
surface, it might not, by possibility, communicate with that
on the exterior.       For this purpose I obscured with naphtha on
both sides a central portion of wire-gauze containing 3,600
 meshes to the square inch, and having ignited this on one side,
 I found it did not communicate with that of the other, nor to
 alcohol, ether, or sulphuret of carbon applied by means of a
camel hair pencil          I find I can even burn alcohol on each side,
 separated only by the fine open curtain of wire-gauze, without
 the flames " mingling into one," and this is beautifully illus
 trated from different colours being imparted to flaming alcohol
 by nitrates, copper, and strontites.            My experiments with in
flammable gases led to similar results'.
    I could not, by means of the blowpipe, force flame through
 this plexus, even when red hot, to fire ether applied by a pencil
to the opposite side.        I need not insist on the varied experiments
 I instituted.    The application of wire-gauze to cut off the com
 munication of flame is as extensive as the necessities and con
 veniences of life.       Enveloped in a mantle of wire-gauze lined
 with woollen, we may run the gauntlet of flame, and defy its
 power.
    Imprisoned in the cylinder of wire-gauze              the captive fire
damp possesses no cause for alarm, exhibiting            to the astonished
eye an impressive and beautiful phaenomenon.
                      I am respectfully, sir,
                                      Very obediently yours,

 LIV. Description of the Menagerie nt Schoenlrunn                in Austria.
                     By M. Marcel de Serres*.
 The      menagerie of Schcenbrann is the most extensive in Europe.
 All  the animals whicW       it contains are separated from each other,
 and have a commodious asylum against the severity of the
 weather, and abundance of space for exercise. It is in the valleys
 of the fine park of Schcenbrunn that the dens or cages are to be
 seen for the various animals.          The extremity of these rows of
 cages is merely closed with an iron gate, and the public have
 therefore a full view of all the animals in the menagerie.             AU of
 {hem    have  every  thing    they  want beside  them.     Thus    they  have

  water in which to bathe, a thick shade to screen them from
 the sun, as well as an open field in which they may enjoy its
  rays.
     Several very rare animals have lived in the menagerie of
  Schcenbrunn : but we shall only instance at present the wild ox of
 Transylvania, known to naturalists by the name-of aurochs (Bos
 urns), a species remarkable for the crest or mane it presents on
 its back.   The aurochs is now an almost extinct breed, and it is
 onlv in Lithuania that it is to be met with: it should seem as
 if this species had been very abundant in the forests of that part
 of Europe, as well as in those of Hungary. Thus, as we have had
 occasion to observe in the living state the animal designated
 by Aristotle as the lonasos, and which the moderns had parti
 cularly distinguished by the name of aurochs and Los unis ; we
 thought that the description of an animal so rare might be
 interesting to naturalists.     We have therefore been induced to
 publish the following observations, which we had collected re
 specting an animal that naturalists have so seldom seen.              This
 description might     also have  a  high degree    of interest,  since  the
 hones of the same individual which we have seen living, are de
 posited in the Natural History Museum at Paris.
    The aurochs, or wild ox of the north of Europe, is a species
 known since the time of Aristotle, who alone of all the Greeks
 has left us a detailed description, in designating them under the
 name of honasos.         While thus designating the aurochs, the
 Paeonians called it monapos, and it seems that it was still
 known under the name of monops, of monetos, and of monapos.
 As, subsequently, various Latin authors have erroneously distin
 guished two kinds of wild oxen, some moderns, thinking they
 discovered the second species in the bison, have thought that the
 Greek expression lonasos was a translation                of the Celto-
 Scythian word won'nas, formed of the article as and the
Sclavonic word wormy, which signifies perfume.                   Thus, as
Aristotle observed that the lonasos was called by the Paeonians
monapos; this latter word has been derived from monapux, signi
fying having a thick mane.         It is evident that all these etymo
logies may    be  well  founded,   since  the aurochs exhales a very
perceptible smell of musk, and pr-esents a thick mane; but they
are far from proving the opinion which is sought to be drawn.
    The description given by Aristotle of the aurochs is too de
tailed to permit us to quote it entirely ; but we shall give the
principal heads of it:
                          " The size of the aurochs is that of a bull,
but shorter and thicker than the ox.          Its skin is so large that
it may serve as a bed for seven persons.          Its mane is covered
                                                             '
with softer and longer hairs than that of the horse. The breast
of the lonasos is fawn-coloured, and its mane is of a reddish
                                                                      gra.v,
                                                  I

                      at Schcenlrunn in Austria.                   251
gray, and falls over the eyes and shoulders. The hair of the lower
part or belly is darker, and like wool."      Its feet are cloven, and
the teeth as well as the interior parts are similar to those of the
ox. The arrangement which Aristotle gives to the horns of the
aurochs — of being folded and bent over each other in such away
that they cannot strike — is a peculiarity of the individual whick
Aristotle had before him ; and which must have been correct, for
 he repeats the description twice.      We know however that this
 character can scarcely be regarded as constant, since it varies in
 the same individual.      Lastly, he assigns to each horn the size
 of a palm or upwards.
     With the exception of the fable which Aristotle relates on the
subject of the excrements of the aurochs, and which Pliny and
/Elian have carefully preserved, the description of this great na
 turalist is distinct and clear.   Finally, he assigns Paeonja as the
 country of the Ionasos, and says that it inhabits Mount Mena-
 pius, which separates Paeonia from Media.        Pliny, in afterwards
 copying the description of Aristotle, does not endeavour to as
 certain what animal could be the Ionasos of the Greek naturalist ;
 he merely contents himself with saying : " Tradunt in Pueonia
feram, quae bonasus vocatur, equina juba, cetera tauro sirailem,
 cornibns ita in se flexis ut non sint utilia pugnae ; quapropter
 fuga sibi auxiliari reddentem in ea .fimum interdum et trium
jugerum longitudine : cujus contactus sequentes ut ignis aliquis
 amburat."       Hitherto Pliny only speaks of one species of wild
 ox, as well as Aristotle ; but in other places he designates two,
since he says : " Jubatos bisontes excellentique vi et velocitate
 uros quibus imperitum vulgus bubalorum nomen imponit."              He
 also returns to those two species of oxen ; and observes that the
 Greeks had not experienced the medical properties of the wild
oxen or bisons, with which the forests of India are filled.       Plin.
 Hist. Nat. c. 28.
   . Solinus in copying the Latin naturalist also distinguishes two
 kinds of wild oxen; and" he asserts that in the forests of Hyr-
 cania the bisons are very common as well as the wus, and that
 these are the oxen distinguished by the vulgar under the name of
 bubalus.     Oppian speaks of the Ionasos in a manner as inexact
 as Pausanias, who, in describing the bulls exhibited in the spec
 tacles at Rome, does not give the name of bonasos, but rather
 bison, making it come from Paeonia, the country of the former,
 as Aristotle had observed.
     Caesar, always accurate in his details, has decribed the bonasus
 of Aristotle by the name of wus.          But he has described onlv
 one species of wild bull which he load observed in the forests of
 Hyrcania, This animal, he says, is very large, having the co
                                                                   lour,

lour, stature, and carriage of a bull : their strength and agility
are also, as he says, extreme*.
   Virgil in his Georgics, like Julius Caesar in his Commentaries,
makes mention of only one species of wild ox, which he also
calls urus.
   In the second book of his Georgics we find the following pas
sage :
             "   Texendse sepes etiam, et pecus orone tenendum est,
                 Praicipue duin frons tenera iuiprudensque laborum;
                 Cui, super indignas hyeme's, soleuique potentein,

                                                                     Gear. lib.   ii.   v. 371.
  In his third book he returns to the subject                        ;
             '' Tempore non alio dicunt regionibus jllis
                Quaisitas ad sacra boves Junonis, et uris
                 Imparibus     ductos alta ad donaria currus."
                                                          Geor. lib. iii. ver. 531.
  Seneca and Martial                    distinguished,        like Pliny, two species             of
wild oxen
                           " Tibi

   As Pliny had already designated the bonasos of Aristotle                                       by
the name of bubalus,     evident that Martial had Pliny in his
                                    it   is
eye.
   Thus the ancients, with the exception of Caesar and Aristotle,
distinguished two kinds of wild oxen, which the moderns have
endeavoured to trace     but the inquiry has led most of our mo
                                    :
dern   naturalists to think that the oxen with humps on the
shoulders were of the same race with the aurochs, and that all
oxen with or without humps came from the wild ox of Lithuania.
Gessner was the first modern naturalist who distinguished the
bison of the ancients from the urus; and his opinion in addition
to Buifon's has rendered the difficulties on the subject more in
tricate.         important, in short, to know
                 It   is                         the bisons of the if
ancients were the same species with the bonasos of Aristotle,
and    ifthe oxen of the new continent, called improperly bisons,
belong also to the same race.    Lastly,   the domestic oxen came
                                                              if
  * Lib. vi.  26.    The edition of Julius Caesar, by Clarke, printed at
^London in  1712, gives a very large figure to the aurochs, hat      verv inT     it   is
accurate.   The neck and fore legs are                   by
                                              far too short, and the a/iterior
part   is  far too broad.

    from the wild oxen of Paeonia and Lithuania, or rather from
    another primitive stock.     The most illustrious naturalist of our
    days (Buffon)    endeavours to  throw light on these delicate ques
    tions, without doing so, however, in the most satisfactory man
    ner.     Messrs. Cuvier, Lace"pede, and Geoffroy have together
    nearly set the matter at rest. It results from their observations :
         1. That it appears very clear that the bonasos of Aristotle is
    the same animal with the urus of Julius Caesar, and that the
     lison of the Romans is this very bonasos, to which the appella
    tion of bubafus has also been given.
        2. That the ox with the hunch of the new continent, named
    improperly bison, is a species of ox which has nothing in com
    mon with the bonasos of Aristotle, who does not seem to have
*
    known the ox with the hunch.        Besides, if Aristotle had known
    an ox with a hunch, he would not have asserted in the same place
    where he speaks of the bonasos, that the camel was the only
     quadruped which had a hunch on the back.
         3. That we ought to acknowledge the zebra as the source
    of our race of domestic oxen, rather than the aurochs, which
     differs from the former by characters which it is not usual for
     nature to vary.
         4. That the name of urus, applied by Julius Caesar to the ani
     mal just described, might be a name originally German, as Al-
     drovandus and Gessner have already imagined ; and this opinion
     appears to us niueh more probable than that of Mac,robius,
     who regarded the name of urus as a French word.          In fact, th«
     Germans still designate the urus by the name of auer-ochs, wald-
     ocfis, and ur-ochs, which signifies properly wild ox, or ox of the
     forests.    Those who are familiar with the German language
     know how easy it is to imagine that the varieties in pronuncia
     tion adopted in Germany might have changed the word urus
     into aurochs: the fact      is,
                                 the former     merely
                                                is        softer pronun
                                                               a
     ciation of the word.    Servius explains the word urus in     a man
     ner much more learned; and he derives         from the Greek word
                                                     it
     igo;, which signifies mountain.
                   Description   of    the Aurochs or Bos Urus.
         The size of the aurochs                   surpass that of our
                                        does not much
    largest-sized domestic oxen     but its form
                                        :            much thicker and
                                                          is
    squatter.    This thickness      the more remarkable when we
                                       is
    compare   it with the anterior part of the body of the urus, which
    is much broader.     This greater breadth     particularly remark
                                                     is
    able in the legs.   But their larger size seems to depend merely
    on the muscles; for in the skeletons of the various species we
    do not remark any very marked differences.
                                                                       The

   254                 Description  of the Menagerie
      The shape or contours are rugged, and not soft or round like
   those of the domestic ox, and all its limbs strongly indicate iri
   some measure its savage nature and great strength.            The thick
   and woolly mane which covers all the anterior part of the body
   of the aurochs, and the thick beard which hangs below its chin,
   give it a wild air, which the intenseness of its stare and its
   sombre and grave countenance render still more striking.
      The head of the aurochs is very broad, nay, even almost
   square.   In its greatest breadth it measures eleven inches five
  lines, while its greatest length is IS inches.      If we compare the
  breadth of the head of our domestic oxen with that of the
  aurochs, we find that they are nearly as 3 to 4.            The forehead
  of the aurochs is also broader than it is high, and it is full and
  swoln, but less so than that of the buffalo.             .
      This last character is even particular enough to enable u»
  easily to distinguish this species from that of cur domestic oxen,
  which have their forehead flat and a little concave.            This dis
  position  of the   forehead with  that  of the  horns   separates those
  two species  :  thus   the horns   of the  aurochs   are   not placed on
 the same level with the upper line of the forehead, but rather
 below, so that they form with the line of the forehead an acute
  angle.    The horns of the common ox are on the contrary more-
 elevated than the line of the forehead, so that they form with
  it an almost obtuse angle.       As to the plan of the occiput, it is
 quadrangular      in  the  domestic   ox, while it is semicircular in
 the aurochs.
     The salient angle of the interorbitary arcade forms in the au
 rochs a marked prominence of two inches, which is very con
siderable.     The anterior of the head of the urus, the part where
 the nostrils are placed, is singularly flat and square in this
species.     This flatness is not found in any other species, and'
seems to be a character peculiarly inherent to the latter.            The
nostrils of the aurochs have this particularity, that they form
almost a perfect circle ; whereas those of the buffalo and do
mestic ox are decidedly oval. As to the black skin of the nostrils,
it is thick and solid, and forms a thick flap.
     The head of the aurochs is very hairy, and it is particularly
under the chin that it presents a thick and occasionally a long
beard.      The ears of this species of ox are short, hairy, and
placed behind above the horns.          As to the horns, as their di
rection is subject to vary, and as the same individual presents
them sometimes in opposite directions, we shall not stop to de
scribe them.        We shall content ourselves with observing here
that this direction is never from front to back, as in the buffalo
for instance ; besides, in this species they ate thick and broad,
                                                                       but

                      at Schaenlrunn  in Austria.                 255
but short : this is not the case always in the races of our do
mestic oxen ; for instance, in the varieties of the oxen of Hun
gary, and even of Romania, which have very long horns.
    The urus has a broad but short neck, and we do not see that
the skin ever forms numerous and pendent folds, as observed in
the domestic ox, and in the greater number of the species of
this genus.     It is generally very hairy and covered with a thick
mane, which always becomes thicker towards the lower part.
It is this mane which has made this species be confounded by
several naturalists with the lhon of the new continent, which
seems to have a mane still more abundant.
    The form of the body of the aurochs is generally thicker than
that of the domestic oxen, and its body is also much more hairy,
particularly in the fore parts and on the back.       The hairs are
generally very long and very thick.        Finally, the aurochs has
fourteen pair of ribs, while we observe but thirteen in all the
other species of oxen.
     The lags of the urus are short and thick, particularly the fore
legs : they are also covered with long and numerous hairs ; the
 feet are cloven and hairy, the hoofs are short, but strong and
thick : as to the fetlocks, they are long and placed above the
hoofs. From the direction of these fetlocks they almost touch the
ground : those of the fore feet are shorter and more square than
 those of the hind feetr which are longer, but also not so broad.
     The tail of the aurochs scarcely reaches half down the thigh;
but the hair which covers it touches the ground: it is tufted, and
 the hair is long and thick.
     The breast of the aurochs which we saw, was of a reddish
brown, or of a dull fawn colour, and almost of one tint: the
 hair of the body, as well as the mane which covered the whole
 of the neck and part of the shoulders, had not that grayish
 tinge which Aristotle makes one of the characters of the bonasos.
 The hair of the urus is not short and frizzled, but, on the con
 trary, long and straight, and in the individual just mentioned
 it is of a generally uniform colour.
     The auraths presents, therefore, as its chief characters : a face
 very flat, the forehead slightly swoln, the horns placed below
 the line of the occiput, and the interorbitary arcade very salient ;
 Lastly, a thick mane and fourteen pair of ribs. The characters
 presented by the occiput, of being arranged in a semicircle, and
 of forming an obtuse angle with the forehead, are also equally
 important, and may very clearly serve for the distinction of this
 species.
     The dimensions of the aurochs are as follow:
     Length following the curvature of the back, nine feet three
  inches.                                                     Length

    We may refer to the aurochs the descriptions and figures un
 der mentioned.
     1. The species which Aristotle has described by the name of
 bonosos.
    2. The species of oxen described by the Greeks by the names
 of monapos, monepos, and monops.
    3. The oxen described by Pliny, under the names of bo7insus,
 lubahts, and bison, as well as all those which the ancient Latin
 authors called by these names.       We must not confound with
 the aurochs  the species which some moderns have described by
 the name of bubalus, which is nothing but the buffalo.
    4. The urus of Julius Caesar and Virgil.
    5. The figures of Aldrovandus are so inaccurate that we rati
scarcely refer to the aurochs that which he gives of the urus.
As to Johnston, as he has adopted the opinion of certain Latin
 authors in distinguishing the two species of wild oxen, he has
 also given drawings of them.       In plate xix. he has given the
 bonasos ; and in plate xx. the urus.       If these two figures were
 accurate, they would certainly indicate two very different ani
 mals; but when we consider the little credit which Johnston de
 serves, we cannot refer to them with propriety.
                                                               6. The

           6. The ox figured in the Commentaries of Sigismond D'Her-
        Derstein.
           7. The ox represented by Anthony Wied in the Map of Mus
        covy.
           8. The ox represented in the large edition of Julius Caesar
        published at London by Clarke.      In this figure the feet are re
        presented by far too small to support the mass of the body.
           9. The zimbre or wild ox of Moldavia, or the zuber, zubr, tur
        or taron of Poland, is certainly the aurochs.
           10. The white bison of Forster and Pennant is only a variety
        of the aurochs.
           11. The figure of the female urus, given by Gilibert in his
         History of Quadrupeds.                                                 v
            12. The figure of the aurochs of Bertueh,       plate xiv. fig. 1,
    '   which is to be found in the Tafeln des Allgcmcinen Naiurge-
        schichle.    The figures given by Bertuch are so small, and in
        general so bad, that we can place but little confidence in them.
            13. The descriptions which Pallas has given of the urus are
        exact, and he also cites another description of the anatomist
        Wilde, which has the same advantage.
           The aurochs which we saw was a male, which had lived thirty
        years in the menagerie.      It came from Transylvania.       In a fire
        which broke out in the place where it was kept, it owed its

        which it was fastened, dug up the door of its den, and over
        throwing every obstacle escaped from the flames.           This great
        strength  of the aurochs  would   make  it very valuable   if it could
    •
        be trained for domestic purposes ; but all the attempts made to
        tame this one at Schcenbrunn were fruitless.       When I saw       it,   it
        was not quite so ferocious, for age had diminished its strength.
        The branches of trees which had been given           it for food, and
        of which  it was very fond, had so worn down its teeth that           it
        could no longer digest but with pain, not being able to masti
        cate.   It died soon afterwards of consumption.
           The aurochs    isa species almost lost in the present day: some
        few individuals only are found thinly scattered in the forests of
        Lithuania and Transylvania. We are assured that there are
        some in the Krapac Mountains also.        Itappears that   it was for
        merly very common     in some temperate regions of Europe.        The
        descriptions of ancient Latin authors give us every reason to be-

 LV. On   the Cosmogony       of Moses.          By Dr. PricharD;   in
                      Reply       to   F.   E-— s.
                        To     Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —   In  the last number of the Philosophical Magazine I ob
serve a second attack upon my paper on the Mosaic Cosmogony.
I had declined entering into any further controversy on this
subject ; but on mature consideration it appears to me a matter
Of so much importance to prove that the exordium of the He
brew Scriptures is capable of a rational and philosophical inter
pretation, instead of one which gives it very much the air of a
piece of mythology, that I have resolved to reply to the stric
tures of your correspondent.
    He has detected me in one error, to which I must certainly
plead guilty ; viz. that of citing Laplace's Syslcme du Monde
by a designation not quite accurate.       I wrote in great haste,
 and had not leisure for correcting my composition; and I could
 even point out to mv keen-sighted     adversary some other verbal
 inaccuracies equally important, which I discovered in looking
 over my paper since I received the number of the Philosophical
 Magazine which contains it ; but as these matters have Httle
 relation to the argument before us, I shall proceed to consider
 on what grounds I am accused by Mr. F. E          s of contradict
 ing my own statements.
    I observed in my first paper, that the speculations of heathen
philosophers on the Cosmogony were founded on some fanciful
analogy with natural processes that are daily observed ; and in
rhy last communication     I have said that, the historical docu
ments contained in the early part of Genesis may be traced
among many remote nations ; and that not only the Asiatics but
the Scandinavians and Mexicans " were equally in possession of
the primitive traditions."     But I beg to have it observed, that
in this latter instance I made no allusion to the Cosmogony.
Neither the Scandinavians nor the Mexicans had, as far as I
remember, any notions on this subject which bore the slightest
analogy to the account which we have in the Pentateuch.        The
former on the contrary held that the earth was in the beginning,
the dead body of a huge giant, while the latter imputed the
origin of the human species to the fall of an aerolite.      Yet in
the mythological fables of both these nations there are many
circumstances referring to the history of mankind, which were
evidently derived from the same source wi^h some relations con
tained in the early Scriptures of the Hebrews ; and it was only
for the sake of proving this connexion, and the consequence
which I deduced from    it, that they were alluded to.     may add
                                                            I

                               On   the Cosmogony    of Moses.                                    25&
that those nations who preserved the tradition of the Cosmogony,
the Hindoos for example, added so many fictitious circum
stances to        that in the character which
                    it,                                  assumes in their
                                                                    it
hands     it may well be contrasted with that simple narrative of
events which we find in the beginning of Genesis.
    Neither     the hypothesis, that the early parts of this book are
                    is
a compilation — incompatible with the opinion that Moses was
an inspired writer unless      ;   be proved that all inspired persons
                                         it
have possessed the attribute of omniscience, which                   am not         I
disposed to concede as self-evident truth.
                                    a                    as Mr. F.  If,                 E          s
maintains, the supposition that Moses had recourse to previously
existing documents implies the want of inspiration,               would beg         1
to ask whether St. Matthew -and St. Luke were in want of in
spiration when they had recourse to previously existing docu
ments     incompiling their genealogies           Or,?    they wrote from
                                                                    if
immediate revelation, how happened                that one of them fol
                                                         it
lowed th* Hebrew text, and the other theSeptuagint translation                                     ?
It   isabsurd to hold any argument on the extent of endowments
concerning the nature and limitations of which we are wholly
ignorant; but the example above cited             sufficient to prove that
                                                          is
it    not beneath the dignity of an inspired writer to avail him
     is
self of historical documents where any such exist.                 Michaelis
has fully proved that Moses framed his code of laws by combi
ning the ancient usages of the nomadic Hebrews with the insti
tutions of the agricultural Egyptians.          Surely then we may ven
ture to conjecture that he adopted into his annals the most au
thentic docffitients that existed concerning the history of the
world. But the account of the Cosmogony must have been at
first derived from       particular revelation, and therefore
                               a                                         just           it   is
as easy to suppose that           was revealed to Moses as to Enoch
                                        it
or Noah. -       allow the force of this argument, and should ac
                    I
quiesce      the conclusion drawn from
               in                                        it,
                                                      there were not facts
                                                               if
which appear to prove that the document in question                    really           is
 more ancient than the age of Moses.
    Notwithstanding Mr. F.               s's objections,
                                         E                     still manifest
                                                                          it   is
that the Cosmogony of Menu bears              remarkable analogy to that
                                                     a
of Moses.      In the former          said that at the close or termi
                                         it   is
nation of each night a reiterated act of creation took place.
 How does this differ essentially from the force of the phrases
"The evening had come and the morning had come — one day —
when God said, Let there be            firmament," &c? This
                                              a                         not              is        :i

 said the morning and evening.           The expressions are equivalent
to these: After the close of one day, and when the dawning of
 another had appeared, the act of creation was renewed.                 Twi

260                   On the Cosmogony            of   Moses',
 are presently told by Menu that each day comprehended, a long
 succession of ages.       In the Etruscan Cosmogony, which bears a
 still more striking analogy to the Hebrew, and on which your
  correspondent has forgotten to make any remark, the duration
  of eacli period is expressly mentioned to have been a chiliad, or
 a thousand vears.       If the Hindoos and Etruscans derived these
  records from the same source whence Moses obtained his account,
                                                                             -
 which I think almost certain, the conclusion I have drawn seems
 to be scarcely avoidable.
      I now proceed to " the other and more weighty objection —
  that it does not appear that the Hebrew people ever understood
 the six days of the creat ion" in any other sense than the literal
 one.     And here I would beg leave to ask Mr. F. E                  s how
 we are to interpret the passage in which it is said that God
 created man after his own image.           Are we to understand by a
 metaphor, that man was created an intellectual and moral being;
 or must we receive the expressions literally, as we hav# reason
 to believe the Hebrew people did, who are supposed on good
 grounds to have been anthropomorphites ?             If so, I presume we
must also give a literal interpretation to such phrases as " It
 repented God,"
                       " God rested on the seventh day," &c. &c.
 And if we succeed in establishing all these points, we shall at
 length bring the theology of Moses much more nearly on, a level
 with that of Hesiod than it has been supposed to be.                  howIf,
 ever,   asI   suppose    will
                          it   be conceded,    these expressions    demand
a   figurative explanation, though the Hebrew people^ at least the
vulgar, understood them literally;          am at liberty to assume the
                                             I
 same latitude with respect to the days of the creation.              While      ,
 adverting to the prevalent notions of the Hebrews on this sub
ject, it   is somewhat surprising that Mr. F.             E   did Hot think
                                                                 s
it  worth while to take notice       of the   opinions   of  the  two most
 learned antiquaries of that nation, viz. Josephus and Philo,
whom   I      cited in my last paper, and who expressly affirm that
 the account of the six days' work          metaphorical.
                                             is                 Philo parti-
 cularly    savs,  " It  aispiece    rustic
                                    of       simplicity   to  understand        it
literally."
    Lastly; Mr. F.        E   says that
                               s            have effected the coinci
                                                  I
dences which call upon him to admire between the Cosmogony
                 I
and the Epochs of Nature,      transferring the creation of zoophytes
                               by
and testacea from the fifth day to the third whereas, according
                                                          ;
to the sense in which the twentieth and two following verses in
the first chapter of Genesis "have hitherto been generally wider-
stood, all the inhabitants         the waters were called into ex
istence on the Jijtk day."          It of
                                       of little importance in what
                                            is
sense these passages     have been generally understood      carelessby
readers,   if   the expressions they contain will not bear the con

struetion imputed to them.         The LXX certainly did not under
 stand the words which describe the fifth day's creation as in
 cluding corals and bivalves, otherwise they surely would not have
rendered them tol to\ti\ rx ix-syiXa, xai %oi<rav "S/wxyv £a,a)v hqireruiv.
 The Hebrew word which the LXX have rendered kowerel gives
the idea of progressive motion ; and it occurs in a similar sense
 in many other places, but particularly in Psalm civ. 20, where
it is applied to the roving of wild beasts in the night. It is
therefore very certain, as your correspondent has hinted, that
 Moses has assigned no place for zoophytes and testacea; neither
 has he mentioned forest-trees, or shrubs, or lichens, for he did
not write the Cosmogony with the Sy sterna Nalurce before him,
The Hebrew language being very poor in terms of classification,
a few leading objects in each class are mentioned; and we are
left to understand that the analogous kinds were conjoined with
those which are named.          Thus in the third day's creation we are
told that "grass and seed-bearing herbs and fruit-bearing trees"
began to exist ; and we are left to supply all the remainder of
 the vegetable world, including marine plants to which no allu
sion is made.       It is not going much further out of the way to
add corals and madrepores, and even testacea, considering that
no other place is allotted to them, and that on the next day
whales and progressive aquatic animals only are mentioned.              At
any rate,  it  is evident  that  Moses   had  it not  in contemplation
to make a complete census of the whole number of created
beings : and when we find zoophytes and testacea associated in
the earth with the earliest remains of vegetable productions, and
evidently belonging to the same epoch in the creation, the pre
sence of the former constitutes no exception to the coincidence
which would otherwise be complete.
    Mr. F. E         s seems to have given Tip his hypothesis for ex
plaining the revolution of night and day before the creation of
the sun, and even avows that he was aware of the physical cir
cumstances which render it untenable, before he advanced it,
There is one interpretation, however, of the fourteenth and fol
lowing verses which will assist him out of this difficulty, and
will even remove one great objection to the sense he attaches to
the six days.      The explanation I allude to, is that which was
proposed by Dr. Geddes, a learned but bold commentator, whose
method of criticism merits in many instances the severest repre
hension.     In this particular passage I believe he has discovered
the true sense ; and I shall therefore cite his translation of          it,
though  it  deprives me of one argument in favour of my own hy
pothesis1 which has not been answered.            Dr.' G. considers the
words " Let there be lights in the firmament           of heaven to ilr
luminate the earth," as equivalent to " Let lights appear," &c.
                                 R3                                   and

and he proves that the words here used do not necessarily imply
a new creation of the sun, and cites the authority of Origeu
who was of the same opinion.          Accordingly the sun may have
existed before this period, though it only now became visible on
the earth in consequence of the changes which had taken place
in the terrestrial atmosphere.       On this hypothesis all the mo
tions of the solar system may be supposed to have subsisted
for ages before the epoch to which the Mosaic Cosmogony (ex
cept perhaps the first verse of        refers.
                                            it)
    If  this interpretation be allowed, the whole Cosmogony will
present       scheme perfectly rational and consistent with itself, as
              a
well as coinciding admirably with the information which natural
philosophers have gained concerning the system of the world.
It well known that certain stars have at various times disap

peared from the heavens or have ceased to be luminous, while
others have been observed which were not before visible; as the
star observed by Hipparchus, which induced that celebrated
astronomer to make         catalogue of the heavenly bodies, and that
                                   a

 condition of our sun and solar system before the period when
 light   is  said           by
                       Moses to have appeared in the world; and
 during the preceding ages the state of the earth revolving round

   Ver. 3 — i.      The solar svstem became illuminated by the
sun, which had hitherto been a dark body.                 " The light here
mentioned," says Dr. Gedd.es,         "   may even from the context it
self be readily supposed to be but an imperfect and partial light,
such as we often see in a foggv day; which light would gradually
increase in proportion as the air was expanded and rarefied, until
on the fourth day it received the utmost degree of brightness
from the unclouded appearance of the sun."             This indeed seems
to be the only sense in which it is possible to understand the
existence of light before the appearance of the sun.             The com
mon interpretation of the " days" of the creation is thus ren
dered more tenable than it can otherwise become.

                             To    Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —   In   addition to what I have already communicated* to
 you, in regard to my methods of preparing emetic tartar, I beg
 to submit to your readers a copy of a letter which I sent, above
 two years ago, to the President of the Roval College of Physi*
 cians, London.
    This I hope will serve as a protection against the officious
 and, I may say, illiberal, intrusion of .one, who seems still de
termined to injure my professional reputation and, consequently,
 the welfare of my family.
    I have said methods, because, by more ways than one, I have
effected the decomposition, and have proved that an oxide of
antimony, fit for the purpose, can be obtained directly from the
common black sulphuret either by means of nitric acid alone,
properly diluted with water, or the ingreditnts themselves by
which this acid is prepared, together with the necessary quantity
of water.
    The process which I sent to you,>and which you have already
admitted into the Philosophical Magazine, has been supported
by the most ample and favourable testimonies, both by manu
facturers and others who are competent to judge of its merits ;
I have therefore no inducement at present to recommend any
change in that prescription.
    I take this occasion to declare that, excepting the preparation
of the medicine in question, the tartarized antimony, I had less
£0 do with the changes that have been made either in the
                                                                   for
mer volume or in the editio nova of the Pharmacopoeia than
may be supposed ; I had no direct communication with the
committee; nor do I know, even at this moment, how and of
whom this committee was composed, whether it was open to all
the members of the College, or secret and select ; consequently
I had no opportunity of preventing the material error (turn cola)
which had unfortunately slipped into the formula for anlimonium
tarlarizaliim.
    The letter, of which I shall subjoin       a copy, was never meant
to be kept as a secret, further than to be presented first to the
consideration of the committee, which, as I understood, had been
appointed to reform the Pharmacopoeia of the London College.
This letter,   if admitted into your pages, will serve as a registry,
notwithstanding all that has been asserted by one who has writ
ten so much and done so little, that the prpcess which the Col
lege has now abandoned might have been profitably modified ;

nitrous acid largely diluted with water.       This produces an oxide
of antimony which, after being properly washed, is to be boiled
with supertartrate of potass and distilled water.        The operation
is then to be finished in the usual manner by evaporation and
crystallization.

                              To Mr. TUloch.
Sir," —    I have     lately formed an electric column, by a process
somewhat      different from any hitherto adopted, I believe ; and
imagining that it may prove a very convenient one, I wish by
means of your publication to make it known, hoping that those
persons who are interested about this curious instrument will
make experiments to determine the comparative power of a
column formed by this method, and one made according to Mr.
De Luc's original plan.
   Not being able easily to procure manganese in a finely-pow
dered state, which I understand has been made use of instead
of plates of zinc, I was desirous of trying the effect of zinc very
fmely powdered; and having obtained some of this substance
pulverized, in order to get the very fine particles I sifted it
through muslin, then mixed it with a solution of common glue
and some moist sugar.           This mixture I laid on the back of
                                                               Dutch-:

Dutch-gilt        embossed  paper with a brush, by which method a
triple disc was obtained, consisting of Dutch metal (copper),
paper and zinc.        Perhaps some one may be able to describe the
exact method of making the Dutch-gilt paper; if so, I shall
esteem it a favour to be informed of it. I understand that the
metal   is-formed of copper principally, but of what other sub
stance  is  unknown to me.        It  appears to me that a considerable
advantage may be gained            the above-mentioned process, both
                                  by

of silvered paper and discs of paper with powdered zinc were
used, as the paper would then be more capable of imbibing
moisture from the atmosphere than when both sides are coated
with metal. As the gold-leaf electrometer, commonly used for
experiments with the electric column,           is   rather an expensive
one, and troublesome on account of the delicacy of the gold-
leaves,  it   may not be unacceptable to many of your readers to
be informed, that a metal-leaved electrometer of great sensibility
may at a very reasonable cost be made, with           a  small lamp-glass
fitted up with      amahogany top and base; the leaves are to be
made of Dutch metal fastened to          a  thick piece of brass wire or
slip of wood fixed into a piece of cork (which             to be glued on

Should   it  be found that zinc dust laid on, as in the foregoing
account, does answer the purpose desired; this method may
be worthy of the attention of the philosophical-instrument-ma
kers, as they might probably find           a sale for this (as it'may be
called)   electrical  paper.      Ifzinc  could   be procured in as thin
lraves as silver or Dutch-metal,       it  probably would be better for
electric columns than zinc dust,

LVUf.       Report of the Select Committee of the House of Com
    mons, appointed to inquire, whether it be expedient that the
     Collection mentioned in the Earl of Elgin's Petition, pre
     sented to the House on the 15 th Day of February last, should
     be purchased on behalf of the Public; and     if so, what Price it
    may    be reasoiiable  to allow for  the same.
 J.   he Select Committee consider the subject referred to them,
as divided into four principal      heads ;
     The first of which relates to the authority by which this col
lection was acquired : —The second to the circumstances under
which that authority was granted : —The third to the merit of
the marbles as works of sculpture, and the importance of making
them public propertv, for the purpose of promoting the study of
the fine arts in Great Britain ; — and The fourth to their value as
objects of sale; which includes the consideration of the expense
 which has attended the removing, transporting,           and bringing
them to England.          To these will be added some general obser
vations upon what is to be found, in various authors, relating to
 these marbles.
     I. When the Earl of Elgin quitted England upon his mission
 to the Ottoman Porte, it was his original intention to make that
 appointment beneficial to the progress of the fine arts in Great
Britain, by procuring accurate drawings and casts of the valu
 able remains of sculpture and architecture scattered throughout
 Greece, and particularly concentrated at Athens.
     With this view he engaged Signor Lusieri, a painter of repu
 tation, who was then in the service of the King of theTwoSicilies,
 together with two architects, two modellers, and a figure-painter,
 whom Mr. Hamilton (now under-secretary of state) engaged at
 Rome and dispatched with Lusieri, in the summer of 1800, from
  Constantinople to Athens.
      They were employed there about nine months, from August
  1 800 to May 1801, without having any sort of facility or accom
 modation afforded to them : nor was the Acropolis accessible to
 them, even for the purpose of taking drawings, except by the
  payment of a large fee, which was exacted daily.
      The other five artists were withdrawn from Athens in January
  1803; but Lusieri has continued there ever since, excepting du-
  rjng the short period of our hostilities with the Ottoman Porte.
      During the year 1 800, Egypt was in the power of the French :
  and that sort of contempt and dislike which has always charac
  terized the Turkish government and people in their behaviour
  towards every denomination of Christians, prevailed in full force.
      The success of the British arms in Egypt, and the expeeted
                                                             restitution

  268               Report  of the Select Committee   on
  restitution of that province to the Porte, wrought a wonderful
  and instantaneous change in the disposition of all ranks and de
  scriptions of people towards our nation. Universal benevolence
  and good-will appeared to take place of suspicion and aversion.
  Nothing was refused which was asked ; and Lord Elgin, avail
 ing himself of this favourable and unexpected alteration, ob
  tained, in the summer of 1801, access to the Acropolis for ge
  neral purposes, .with permission to draw, model, and remove;
  to which was added, a special license to excavate in a particular
 place.     Lord Elgin mentions in his evidence, that he was obliged
 to send from Athens to Constantinople for leave to remove a
  house ; at the same time remarking that, in point of fact, all
  permissions issuing from the Porte to any distant provinces, are
 little better than authorities to make the best bargain that can
 be made with the local magistracies.        The applications upon
 this subject passed in verbal conversations ; but the warrants
 or fennauns were granted in writing, addressed to the chief au
 thorities resident at Athens, to whom they were delivered, and
 in whose hands they remained : so that your committee had no
 opportunity of learning from Lord Elgin himself their exact tenor,   -
 or of ascertaining in what terms they noticed, or allowed, the
 displacing or carrying away of these marbles.       But Dr. Hunt,
who accompanied Lord Elgin as chaplain to the embassy, has pre
 served, and has now in his possession, a translation of the second
 fermann, which extended the powers of the first ; but as he had
 it not with him in London, to produce before your committee,
he stated the substance, according to his recollection, which was
 "That, in order to show their particular respect to the ambassa
 dor of Great Britain, the august ally of the Porte, with whom
they were now and had long been in the strictest alliance, they
gave to his excellency and to his secretary, and the artists em
ployed by him, the most extensive permission to view, draw and
model the ancient temples of the idols, and the sculptures upon
them, and to make excavations, and to take away any stones
that might appear interesting to them."          He stated further,
 that no remonstrance was at any time made, nor any displeasure
shown by the Turkish government, either at Constantinople or"
at Athens, against the extensive interpretation which was put
upon this fermann; and although the work of taking down and
removing was going on for months, and even years, and was
conducted in the most public manner, numbers of native la
bourers, to the amount of some hundreds, being frequently em
ployed, not the least obstruction was ever interposed, nor the
smallest uneasiness shown after the granting of this second fer-
maun.       Among the Greek population and inhabitants of Athens
jt occasioned no sort of dissatisfaction ; but, as Mr. Hamilton,
                                                                  art

            the   Earl of Elgin's            Collection     of Marlles, &c.         269
an eye-witness, expresses              it,
                                   so far from exciting any unpleasant
 sensation, the people seemed to feel            as the means of bringing
                                                       it
 foreigners into their country, and of having money spent among
 them.     The Turks showed a total indifference and apathy as to
 the preservation of these remains, except when in              fit of wan
                                                                      a
ton destruction they sometimes carried their disregard so far as
 to do mischief       firing at them.
                     by                    The numerous travellers and
 admirers of the arts committed greater waste, from                very difa
 ferent motive; for many of those who visited the Acropolis
 tempted the soldiers and other people about the fortress to bring
 them down heads, legs, or arms, or whatever other pieces they
 could carry off.
  A    translation of the fermaun itself has since been forwarded
 by  Dr. Hunt, which         printed in the Appendix.
                              is
    II. Upon the second division, must be premised, that an
                                                  it
 tecedently to Lord Elgin's departure for Constantinople, he com
 municated bis intentions of bringing home casts and drawings
 from Athens, for the benefit and advancement of the fine arts ia
 this country, to Mr. Pitt, Lord Grenville, and Mr. Dundas, sug
 gesting to them the propriety of considering             as   national ob
                                                                it   a
ject, fit to be undertaken and carried into effect at the public
 expense    ; but that this recommendation was in no degree en
couraged, either at that time or afterwards.
  It   is evident, from a letter of Lord Elgin to the secretary of
state, 13 January, 803, that he considered himself as having
                          1
 no sort of claim for his disbursements in the prosecution of these
 pursuits, though he stated, in the same dispatch, the heavy ex
 penses in whish they had involved him, so as to make                     ex   it
tremely    inconvenient    for  him  to  forgo   any   of the usual   allow
 ances to which ambassadors at other courts were entitled.                  It
cannot, therefore, be doubted,       that   l.e   looked  upon himself in
this respect as acting iu a character entirely distinct from his
official situation.     But whether the government from whom he
obtained permission did, or could so consider him,              a question
                                                                      is
which can be solved only                by
                                    conjecture and reasoning, in the
absence and deficiency of all positive testimony.             The Turkish
ministers    of that day   are, in fact,  the   only persons in the world
capable (if they are still alive) of deciding the doubt             and   ;         it   is
probable that even they,            jt
                                   were possible to consult then:, might
                                   if
be unable to form anyTery distinct discrimination as to the cha
racter in consideration of which they acceded to Lord Elgin's
request.      The occasion made them, beyond all precedent, pro
pitious   to whatever    was desired in behalf of the English nation;
they readily, therefore, complied with all that was asked               Lord   by
Elgin.     He was an Englishman of high rank; he was also am
bassador from our court          they granted the same permission to
                                   :
                                                                                     no

  270            Report  of the  Select Committee   on
 no other individual  : but then, as Lord Elgin observes, no other
 individual applied for it to the same extent, nor had indeed the
 same unlimited means for carrying such an undertaking into ex
 ecution.    The expression of one of the most intelligent and di
 stinguished of the British traveller's, who visited Athens about
 the same period, appears to your committee to convey as cor
 rect a judgement as can be formed upon this question, which is
 incapable of being satisfactorily separated, and must be taken in
 the aggregate.
    The Earl of Aberdeen, in answer to an inquiry, whether the
 authority and influence of a public situation was in his opinion
 necessary for accomplishing the removal of these marbles, an
 swered, that he did not think a private individual could have ac
 complished the removal of the remains which Lord Elgin ob
 tained : and Dr. Hunt, who had better opportunities of informa
 tion upon this point than any other person who has been ex
 amined, gave it as his decided opinion, that " a British subject
 not in the situation of ambassador, could not have been able to
 obtain from the Turkish government a fermaun of such extensive
 powers."
    It may not be unworthy of remark, that the only other piece
 of sculpture which was ever removed from its place for the pur
 pose of export was taken by M. Choiseul Gouffier, when he
was ambassador from France to the Porte ; but whether he did
it by express permission, or in some less ostensible wav, no means
of ascertaining are within the reach of your committee.      It was
undoubtedly at various times an object with the French-govern
ment to obtain possession of some of these valuable remains, and
it is probable, according to the testimony of Lord Aberdeen, and
others, that at no great distance of time they might have been
removed by that government from their original site, if they had
not been taken away and secured for this country by Lord Elgin.
    III. The third part is involved in much less intricacy: and
although in all matters of taste there is room for great variety
and latitude of opinion, there will be found upon this branch of
the subject much more uniformity and agreement than could
have been expected.       The testimony of several of the most
eminent artists in this kingdom, who have been examined, rates
these marbles in the very first class of ancient art, some placing,
them a little above, and others but very little below the Apollo
Belvidere, the Laocoon, and the Torso of the Belvidere.       They
speak of them with admiration and enthusiasm ; and notwith
standing the manifold injuries of time and weather, and those
mutilations which they have sustained from the fortuitous or
designed injuries of neglect, or mischief, they consider them as
among the finest models, and the most exquisite monuments of
                                                         antiquity.

          the  Earl of Elgin's  Collection of Marlles, &c.       27 1
antiquity.      The general current of this portion of the evidence
makes no doubt of referring the date of these works to the ori
ginal building of the Parthenon, and to the designs of Phidias,
the dawn of every thing which adorned and ennobled Greece.
With this estimation of the excellence of these works it is na
tural to conclude that they are recommended by the same au
thorities as highly fit, and admirably adapted to form a school
for study, to improve our national taste for the fine arts, and to
diffuse a more perfect knowledge" of them throughout this king
dom.
    Much indeed may be reasonably hoped and expected, from
the general observation, and .admiration of such distinguished
examples.       The end of the fifteenth and beginning of the six
 teenth centuries, enlightened by the discovery of several of the
 noblest remains of antiquity, produced in Italian abundant har
 vest of the most eminent men, who made gigantic advances in
 the path of art, as painters, sculptors, and architects.     Caught
 by the novelty, attracted by the beauty, and enamoured of the
 perfection of those newly disclosed treasures, thev imbibed the
 genuine spirit of ancient excellence, and transfused it into their
 own compositions.
     It is surprising to observe in the best of these marbles in how
 great a degree the close imitation of nature is combined with
 grandeur of style, while the exact details of the former in no
 degree detract from the effect and predominance of the latter.
    The two finest single figures of this collection differ materially
 hi this respect from the Apollo Belvidere, which may be selected
  as the highest and most sublime representation of ideal form
  and beauty, which sculpture has ever embodied, and turned into
  sha;ie.
     The evidence 'upon this part of the inquiry will be read with
  satisfaction and interest, both where it is immediately connected
  with these marbles, and where it branches out into extraneous
  observations, but all of them relating to the study of the antique.
  A reference is made by one of the witnesses to a sculptor *,
  eminent throughout Europe for his works, who lately left this
  metropolis highly gratified by the view of these treasures of that
  branch of art which he has cultivated with so much success.
  His own letter to the Earl qf Elgin upon this subject is inserted
  in the Appendix.
      In the judgement of Mr. Payne Knight, whose valuation will
  be referred to in a subsequent page, the first class is not assigned
  to the two principal statues of this collection ; but he rates the
   metopes in the first class of works in high relief, and knows of
                              • Caaova.
                                                               nothing

   272              Report  of the Select Committee oil
  nothing so fine in'tbat kind. He places also the frize in the first
   class of low relief ; and considering a general museum of art to
  be very desirable, he looks upon such an addition to our national
   collection as likely to contribute to the improvement of the arts,
   and to become a very valuable acquisition      ;  for the importation
  of which Lord Elgin is entitled to the gratitude of his countrv.
      IV. The directions of the house in the order of reference
  impose upon your committee the task of forming and sub
  mitting an opinion upon the fourth head, which otherwise the
  scantiness of materials for fixing a pecuniary value, and the un
  willingness, or inability, in those who are practically most con
  versant in statuarv to afford any lights upon this part of the
  subject, would have rather induced them to decline.
      The produce of this collection, if it should be brought to sale
 in separate lots, in the present depreciated state of almost every
  article, and more particularly of such as are of precarious and
  fanciful value, would probably be much inferior to what may be
  denominated its intrinsic value.
      The mutilated state of all the larger figures, the want either
 of heads or features, of limbs or surface, in most of the metopes,
  and in a great proportion of the compartments even of the larger
  frize, reader this collection, if divided, but little adapted to serve
  for the decoration of private houses. It should therefore be
 considered as forming a whole, and should unquestionably be
 kept entire as a school of art, and a study for the formation of
 artists.    The competitors in the market, if it should be offered
 for sale without separation, could not be numerous.            Some of
 the sovereigns of Europe, added to such of the great galleries or
 national institutions in various parts of the continent, as may
 possess funds at the disposal of their directors sufficient for such
 a purpose, would in all probability be the only purchasers.
     It is not however reasonable nor becoming the liberality of
 parliament to withhold upon this account, whatever, under all
 the circumstances, may be deemed a just and adequate price ;
 and more particularly in a case where parliament is left to fix its
 own valuation, and no specific sum is demanded, or even sug
gested, by the party who offers the collection to the public.
     It is obvious that the money expended in the acquisition of
any commodity is not necessarily the measure of its real value.
The sum laid out in gaining possession of two articles of the
same intrinsic worth, may, and often does, vary considerably.
In making two excavations, for instance, of equal magnitude and
labour, a broken, bust or some few fragments may be discovered
in the one, and a perfect statue in the other.          The first cost of
the broken bust and of the entire statue would in that case be
the same; but it cannot be said that the value is therefore
                                                                  equal.

          t he  Earl of Elgin's Collection of Martlet, &c.            273
 equal.     In the same manner, by the loss or detention of a ship,
 a great charge may have been incurred, and the original out
 going excessively enhanced ; but the value to the buyer will in
 no degree be affected by these extraneous accidents.         Supposing
 again, artists to have been engaged at considerable salaries du
ring a large period in which they could do little or nothing, the
first cost would be burdensome in this case also to the employer ;
but those who bought wpuld look only at the value of the article
in the market where it might be exposed to sale, without caring,
or inquiring how, or at what expense it was brought thither.
    Supposing, on the other hand, that the thirteen other metopes
had been bought at the Custom-house sale at the same price
which that of M. Choiseul Gouffier* fetched, it could never be
said that the value of them was no more than twenty-four or
twenty-five pounds a-piece.                             ' .
    It is perfectly just and reasonable that the seller should        erW
deavour fully to reimburse himself for all expenses, and to ac
quire a profit also ; but it will be impossible for him to do so,
whenever the disbursements have exceeded the fair money price
of that which he has to dispose of.
    Your committee refer to Lord Elgin's evidence for the large
and heavy charges which have attended the formation of this
collection, and the placing of it in its present situation ; which
amount, from 1799 to January 1803, to (52,4 40/. including
23,240/. for the interest of money; and according to a sup
plemental account, continued from 1803 to 1 S 16, to no less a
sum than 74,000/. including the same sum for interest.
    All the papers which are in his possession upon this subject,
including a journal of above 90 pages, of the daily expenses of
his principal artist Lusieri (from 1803 to the close of 1 SI 4), who
still remains in his employment at Athens, together with the
account current of Messrs. Hayes of Malta (from April 1807 to
May 1811), have been freelv submitted to your committee ; and
there can be no doubt, from the inspection of those accounts,
confirmed also by other testimony, that the disbursements were
very considerable ; but supposing them to reach the full sum at
which they are calculated, your committee do not hesitate to
express their opinion, that they afford no just criterion of the
value of the collection, and therefore must not be taken as a just
basis for estimating it.
   * M. Choiseul, the French minister at the Porte, had obtained permis
sion to remove sculptures from Athens.   The frigate which was conveying
them to France was captured by Lord Nelson.       The marbles were, after
wards sold at a rummage sale at the Custom-house, and bought by Lord
Elgin, who then thought them a part of his own collection, thf packages
having no directions. — Edit.

    Twer valuation*, and onlv two in detail, have been laid before
your committee, which are printed ; differing most widely in the
•particulars, and in the total ; that of Mr. Pavne Knight amount
ing- to 25,000/. and that of Mr. Hamilton to 60,800/.
    The only other sum mentioned as a money price, is in the
Evidence of the Earl of Aberdeen, who named 35,000/. as a sort
 of oonjectural estimate of the whole, without entering into par
 ticulars.
    In addition to the instances of prices quoted in Mr. Payne
  '
 Knight's evidence, the sums paid for other celebrated marbles
 deserve to be brought under the notice of the house.
    The Townley collection, which was purchased for the British
 Museum in June 1805 for 20,000/., is frequently referred to iti
 the examinations of the witnesses, with some variety of opinion
 A3 to its intrinsic value ; but it is to be observed of all the prin
 cipal sculptures in that collection, that they were in excellent
 condition with the surface perfect ; and where injured, they
 were generally well restored, and perfectly adapted for the de
 coration and almost for the ornamental furniture of a private
liouse, as they were indeed disposed by Mr. Townley in his life
 time.
    In what proportion the state of mutilation in which the Elgin
 marbles are left, and above all the corrosion of much of the sur
 face by weather reduce their, value, it is difficult precisely to as
 certain ; but it may unquestionably be affirmed in the words of
 one of the sculptors* examined (who rates these works in the
 highest class of art) that
                               " the Townleyan marbles being entire,
 are, in a commercial point of view, the more valuable of the two:
 but that the Elgin marbles, as possessing that matter which
 artists most require, claim a higher consideration."
    The .i^Egina marbles, which are also referred to, and were well
 known to one of the members of your committee f, who was in
 treaty to purchase them for the British Museum, sold for (,,000/.
 to the Prince Royal of Bavaria, which was less than the British
 government had directed to be offered, after a prior negotiation
 for obtaining them had failed ; their real value however was
 supposed not to exceed 4000/. at which Lusieri estimated them.
 They are described as valuable in point of remote antiquity, and
 curious in that respect, but of no distinguished merit as speci
 mens of sculpture, their style being what is usually called Etrus
 can, and older than the age of Phidias.
    The marbles at Phigalia, in Arcadia, have lately been pur
 chased for the Museum at the expense of 15,000/. increased by
 a very unfavourable exchange to 10,000/. a sum which your

           the Earl of Elgin's Collection of Martles, &c.         275
 committee, after inspecting them, venture to consider as more
 than equal to their value.
     It is true that an English gentleman*, concerned in disco
 vering tliem, was ready to give the same sum; and therefore no
 sort of censure can attach on those who purchased them abroad,
 for our national gallery, without any possible opportunity of
 viewing and examining the sculpture, but knowing them only
 from the sketches which were sent over, and the place where
 they were dug up, to be undoubted and authentic remains of
  Greek artists of the best time.
     When the first offer was made bv the Earl of Elgin to Mr.
 Perceval, of putting the public in possession of this collection,-
 Mr. Long, a member of your committee, was authorized by Mr.
 Perceval to acquaint Lord Elgin, that he was willing to propose
 to parliament to purchase it for 30,000/. provided Lord Elgin
 should make out, to the satisfaction of a committee of the house
 of commons, that he had expended so much in acquiring and
 transporting it.
     Lord Elgin declined this proposal, for the reasons stated by
 him in his evidence: and until the month of June 1815 too
 further Step was taken on either aide; but at that time a peti
 tion was presented, on the part of Lord Elgin, to the house,
  whiti!, owing to the late period of the session, was not pro
 ceeded upon.      Eighty additional cases have been received since
  1811, the contents of which, enumerated in Mr. Hamilton's
 evidence, now form a part of the collection.         The medals also,
 of which the value is more easily defmed, were not included in
 the proposal made to Mr. Perceval.
     Against these augmentations must be set the rise in the value
 of money, which is unquestionably not inconsiderable, between
  the present time and the year 1811 ; a cause or consequence of
 which is the depreciation of every commodity, either of necessity
 or fancy, which is brought to sale.
     Your committee, therefore, do not think that they should be
justified, in behalf of the public, if they were to recommend to
 the house any extension of Mr. Perceval's offer to a greater
 amount than 5000.7. : and, under all the circumstances that they
 have endeavoured to bring under the view of the house, they
judge thirty-five thousand pounds to be a reasonable and suffi
  cient price for this collection.

2/6                Report   of the Select Committee on
 seum, consider the Earl of Elgin (and his heirs being Earls of
 Elgin) as equally entitled to the same distinction, and recom
 mend that a clause should be inserted to that effect, if it should
 be necessary that an act should pass for transferring his collection
 to the public.
    It may not be deemed foreign to this subject, if your com
 mittee venture ito extend their observations somewhat beyond
 the strict limit of their immediate inquiry, and lay before the
 house what occurs to them as not unimportant with regard to
 the age and authenticity of these sculptures.        The great works
 with which Pericles adorned and strengthened Athens, were all
 carried on under the direction and superintendance of Phidias :
 for this, there is the authority of various ancient writers, and
 particularly of Plutarch ; but he distinctly asserts in the same
 passage, that Callicrates and Ictinus executed the work of the
 Parthenon ; which is confirmed also by Pausanias, so far as re
 lates to Ictinus, who likewise ornamented or constructed the
 temple of Apollo at Phigalla* ; from whence, by a singular
 coincidence, the sculptures in high relief lately purchased for
 the British Museum, and frequently referred to in the evidence,
were transported.
    The style of this work, in the opinion of the artists, indicates
 that it belongs to the same: period, though the execution is
 rated as inferior to that of the Elgin marbles.        In the fabulous
 stories which are represented upon both, there is a very striking
similarity; and it maybe remarked in passing, that the sub
jects of the metopes, and of the smaller frize, which is sculp
 tured with the battle of the Amazons, correspond with two out
 of the four subjects mentioned by Pliny, as adorning the shield
 and dress of the Minerva; so that there was a general unifor
 mity of design in the stories which were selected for the internal
 and external decoration of the Parthenon.            The taste of the
 same artist, Ictinus, probably led him to repeat the same ideas,
 which abound in graceful forms, and variety of composition,
 when he was employed upon the temple of another divinity at
 a distance from Athens.
    The statue of Minerva, within the temple, was the work of
 Phidias himself, and, with the exception of the Jupiter which
 he made at Elis, the most celebrated of his productions.               It
 was composed of ivory and gold ; with regard to which, some
 very curious anecdotes relating to the political history of that
 time are to be found in the same writers : the earliest of which,
   *  The penultimate syllable should be pronounced Ions ; Phigalla closes
 two hexameter verses, one of which is quoted by Pausania?, and the other
 by Stephanus Byzautiaus, from Khianus a pott of Crete.
                                                                    from

          the  Earl of Elgin's    Collection   of Marlles, &c.        277
from a passage in a cotemporary poet, Aristophanes,               proves
that the value of these materials involved both Pericles and the
director of his works in great trouble and jeopardy; upon which
account the latter is said to have withdrawn to Elis, and to have
ended his days there, leaving it doubtful whether his death was
natural, or in consequence of a judicial sentence : but Plutarch
places his death at Athens, and in prison, either by disease or
by poison.
    It has been doubted whether Phidias himself ever wrought in
marble ; but although, when he did not use ivory, his chief
material was unquestionably bronze ; there are authorities suf
ficient to establish, beyond all controversy, that he sometimes
applied his hand to marble.         Pliny, for instance, asserts that he
did so, and mentions a Venus ascribed to him, existing in his
own time in the collection (or in the portico) of Octavia.           Phi
dias is called by Aristotle a skilful worker in stone ; and Pau-
sanias enumerates a celestial Venus of Parian marble, undoubt
edly of his hand; and the Rhamnusian Nemesis, also of the same
material.     Some of his statues in bronze were brought to Rome
by   Paulus ./Emilius, and by Catulus.
    His great reputation, however, was founded upon his repre
sentations of the gods, in which he was supposed more excellent
than in human forms, and especially upon his works in ivory, in
which he stood unrivalled*.
    Elidas the Argive is mentioned as the master of Phidias; which
honour is also shared by Hippias.             His two most celebrated
scholars were Alcamenes an Athenian of noble birth, and Ago-
racritus of Paros ; the latter of whom was his favourite ; and it
was reported, that out of affection to him, Phidias put his
scholar's name upon several of his own works : among which the
statue called Rhamnusian Nemesis is particularized by Pliny and
 Suidas.
    In another passage of Pliny, Alcamenes is classed with Critias,
Nestocles, and Hegias, who are called the rivals of Phidias. The.
name of Colotes is preserved as another of his scholars.
    The other great sculptors who were living at the same time
with Phidias, and flourished very soon after him, were Agelades,
Callon, Polycletus, Phragmon, Gorgias, Lacon, Myron, Pytha
goras, Scopas, and Perelius. ,
    The passage in which Pausanias mentions the sculptures on
the pediments is extremely short, and to this effect : " As you
enter the temple which they call Parthenon, all that is contained
in what is termed the (eagles) pediments, relates in every par
ticular to the birth of Minerva; but on the opposite or back
                         *

 27S                Report  of the Select Committee on
 front   is the contest  of Minerva and Neptune for the land ; — but
  the statue itself is formed of ivory and gold."        The state of di
  lapidation   into  which  this temple  was fallen  when  Stuart visited
 it in 1751, and made most correct drawings for his valuable
 work, left little opportunity of examining and comparing what
 remained upon that part of the temple with the passage referred
  to: but an account is preserved by travellers, who about eighty
  years earlier found one of these pediments in tolerable preserva
 tion, before the war between the Turks and Venetians, in KiSJ,
  had done so much damage to this admirable structure.               The
  observations of one of these (Dr. Spon a French physician) may
  be literally translated thus :
     " The highest part of the front which the Greeks called 1 the
 Eagle,' and our architects ' the Fronton,' is enriched with a
 group of beautiful figures in marble, which appear from below
  as large as life.    They are of entire relief, and wonderfully well
 worked.       Pausanias says nothing more, than that this sculpture
 related to the birth of Minerva.       The general design is this :
     "  Jupiter, who is under the highest angle of the pediment
  (fronton) has the right arm broken, in which, probably, he held
 his thunderbolt ; his legs are thrown wide from each other, with
  out doubt to make room for his eagle.             Although these two
 characteristics arc wanting, one cannot avoid recognising him
 by his beard, and by the majesty with which the sculptor has
 invested him.       He is naked, as they usually represented him,
 aud particularly the Greeks, who for the most part made their
 figures naked ; on his right is a statue which has its head and
 arms mutilated, draped to about half the leg, which one may
 judge to be a Victory, which precedes the car of Minerva, whose
  horses she leads.      They are the work of some hand as bold
 as it was delicate, which would not perhaps have yielded to.
  Phidias, or Praxiteles, so renowned for (representing) horses,
  Minerva is sitting upon the car, rather in the habit of goddess
 of the sciences, than of war ; for she is not dressed as a warrior,
 having neither helmet, nor shield, nor head of Medusa upon
'her breast: she has the air of youth, and her head-dress is not
 different from that of Venus.       Another female figure without a
 head is sitting behind her with a child, which she holds upon
 her knees. 1 cannot say who she is ; but I had no trouble in
 making out or recognising the two next, which are the last on
 that side ; it is the emperor Hadrian sitting, and half naked,
 and, next to him, his wife Sabina.        It seems that they are both
 looking on with pleasure at the. triumph of the goddess.           I do
  not believe that before me any person observed this particularity,
 which deserves to be remarked : ' On the left of Jupiter are five
 or s,ix figures, of which some have lost the heads 3 it is probably

         the   Earl of Elgin's     Collection        of Marbles, bfc.             2/9
the circle of the gods, where Jupiter is about to introduce Mi
nerva, and to make her be acknowledged for his daughter.'     The
pediment behind represented, according    to the same author,  the
riispute'which Minerva and Neptune had for naming the city; but
all the figures are fallen from them, except one head of a sea
horse, which was the usual accompaniment of' this god : these
figures of the two pediments were not so ancient as the body of
the temple built by Pericles, for which there wants no other ar
gument than that of the statue of Hadrian, which is to be seen
there, and the marble which is whiter than the rest.      All the
rest has not been touched.      The Marquis de Nointel had de«-
signs made of the whole, when he went to Athens ; his painter
worked there for two mouths, and almost lost his eyes, because
he was obliged to draw every thing from below, without a scaf
fold." — (Koyaiie par Jacob Spon: Lyons, IG7B ; 2 torn. p. 144.)
    Wheler, who travelled with Spon, and published his Work at
London (four years later)    in l(iS2, says, " But my companion
made me observe the next two figures sitting in the corner to be
of the emperor Hadrian and his empress Sabina, whom I easily
knew to be so, by the manv medals and statues I have seen of
them." And again, " But the emperor Hadrian most probably
repaired it, and adorned it with those figures at each front.    For
the whiteness of the marble, and his own statue joined with
them, apparently show them to be of a later age than the first,
and done by that emperor's command.         Within the portico on
high, and on the outside of the cella of the temple itself, is an
other border of basso relievo round about               it,
                                                 or at least on the                     '
north and south sides, which, without doubt,      as ancient as the

temple, and  of admirable work, but not    so high    relievo as the
                                                                   a

ceremonies of the heathens' worship    most of them were designed

    In the Antiquities of Athens, by Stuart, vol. ii. p. 4, it is said,
,"Pausanias gives but a transient account of this temple, nor
 does he say whether Hadrian repaired                        it,
                                                though his statue
and that of his empress Sabina in the western pediment have
occasioned a doubt whether the sculptures, in both, were not
put up         by
             him.   Wheler and Spon were of this opinion, and
say they were whiter than the rest of the building;.     The statue            ,
of Antinous, now remaining at Rome, may be thought            proof                    a
that there were artists in his time capable of executing them                                ;
but this whiteness     no proof that they were more modern than
                           is
the temple, for they might be made of          whiter marbje a   and                    ;
the heads of Hadrian and Sabina might be put on two of the
ancient figures, which was no uncommon practice among the
Romans      and
              ;    we may give credit to Plutarch, the buildings
                     if
of Pericles were not in the least impaired by age in his time;
therefore, this temple could not want any material repairs in
the reign ot Hadrian."                                       "f'
,   With regard to the works of Hadrian at Athens, Spartian
says "that he did much for the Athenians*;" and a little
after, on his second visit to Athens, " going to the east he made
his journey through Athens, and dedicated the works which he
had begun there       and particularly
                          ;                temple to Olympian Ju
                                                        a
piter, and an altar to himself."
    The account given               by
                             Dion Cassius       nearly to the same
                                                             is
effect, adding, that he placed his own statue within the temple
of Olympian Jupiter, which he erectedf.
    He called some other cities after his own name, and directed a
part of Athens to be styled Hadrianopolis           but no mention
                                                                \:
is made by any ancient author, of his touching or repairing the
Parthenon. Pausanias, who wrote in his reign, says that " the
temples which Hadrian either erected from the foundation, or
adorned with dedicated gifts and decorations, or whatever do
 nations he made to the cities of the Greeks, and of the Bar
barians also, who made application       to him, were all recorded
 at Athens in the temple common to all the gods§."
    It  not unlikely, that
         is                    confused recollection of the statue
                                      a
which Hadrian actually placed* at Athens, may have led one of

upon the pediment of the entrance, and have not been removed
by Lord Elgin.
    An exact copy of these drawings, by the Marquis de Nointel's
painter, is given in M. Barry's works 5 which are rendered more
valuable on account of the destruction of a considerable part of
the temple in the Turkish war by the falling of a Venetian bomb,
within a short time after the year in which they were made ;
which, however, must have been prior to the date of 1683,
affixed to the plate in Barry's Works (2d vol. p. 163.     London,
 1809.)
    Some notes of Mr. Fauvel, a painter and antiquarian,        who
moulded and took casts from the greatest part of the sculptures,
and remained fifteen years at Athens, are given with the tracings
of these drawings ; in which it is said, with regard to these pedi
ments, " these figures were adorned with bronze, at least if we
may judge by the head of Sabina, which is one of the two that
 remain ; and which, having fallen, and being-much mutilated,
 was brought to Mr. Fauvel.      The traces are visible of the little
 cramps which probably fixed the crown to the head.       The head
of the emperior Hadrian still exists.      Probably this group has
 been inserted to do honour to that emperor, for it is of a work
 manship different from the rest of this sculpture."
     Your committee cannot dismiss this interesting subject, with
 out submitting to the attentive reflection of the house, how'
 highly the cultivation of the fine arts has contributed to the re
 putation, character, and dignity of every government by which
 they have been encouraged, and how intimately they are con
 nected with the advancement of every thing valuable in science,
 literature, and philosophy.     In contemplating the importance
 and splendor to which so small a republic as Athens rose, by the
 genius and energy of her citizens, exerted in the path of such
 studies, it is impossible to overlook how transient the memory
 and fame of extended empires and of mighty conquerors are,
 in comparison of those who have rendered inconsiderable states
 eminent, and immortalized their own names by these pursuits.
 But if it be true, as we learn from history and experience, that
  free governments afford a soil most suitable to the production of
  native talent, to the maturing of the powers of the human mind,
  and to the growth of every species of excellence, by opening to
  merit the prospect of reward and distinction, no eountry can be
  better adapted than our own to afford an honourable asylum to
  these. monuments of the school of Phidias, and of the admini
 stration of Pericles ; where, secure from further injury and de

could not wait upon the committee; and these with his answers
thereto are also inserted in the Appendix.
   All the artists examined spoke in the most enthusiastic terms
of  these  noble specimens of art : most of them preferred the
Theseus and the Neptune even to the Belvidere Apollo, and the
Laoeoon ; and all of them agreed that the collection was finer
than any thing they had ever seen.
                     The Phygalian Marbles.
   The following particulars relative to the Phygalian and .ZEgina
marbles are extracted from Mr. Hamilton's evidence before the
committee on the Elgin marbles.
   " Are you acquainted with the transaction relating to the pur
chase of the Phygalian marbles ? — Yes, I am ; the best infor
mation I can give to the committee, on the subject of the pur
chase of the Phygalian marbles, is contained in a memorandum,
the copy of which I put into Mr. Long's hands about ten days
ago^ This is the paper,          was read as follows.]
   " Memorandum on the [it    purchase of the Phygalian Marbles
              on account of the British Government.
   "  When the first intelligence of the discovery of the Phygalian
marbles, by a party of English and German travellers, in the
month of                    1812, was received in England, I heard,
owing to my intimacy with the family of Mr. Cockerell, father
of one of tjie fortunate discoverers, frequent and detailed ac
counts of the beauty of these remains of antiquity, and the ex
traordinary state of preservation in which they had been found,
notwithstanding the lapse of more than twenty centuries since
they had been sculptured.         In that and the subsequent year,
drawings of the bas-reliefs were received in England by various
                                                             hands,

         the   Earl of Elgin's Collection of Marlles, (Sc.          2S3
hands, particularly some very correct ones by Mr.C. R. Cockerel!,
brought by Mr. Frederick North, all attesting the beauty of the
composition, and eminently satisfactory with regard to the age
in which they had been made. These drawings 1 saw frequently
exhibited to persons the most competent to form a judgement of
the merit of the originals ; and they met with universal admira
tion, both in general society, and particularly at the meetings of
the Dilettanti Society.        It was on all hands hoped that they
might     be purchased by     the  British government, and that they
would not     be deterred by    the  bad success of the negotiation for
the ^Egina marbles, from becoming competitors also for these :               ,
these feelings were also expressed by several of the trustees of the
 British Museum, but in such general terms, that I was not very
sanguine of what seemed to be the wish of all being brought
about by the efficient co-operation of a few; though I was aware
 that this offered the only chance of success.       Perhaps the failure
of the two successive attempts, which had been made for the
purchase of the .ZEgina marbles, damped, in some measure, the
disposition of those who, from their public situation, and correct
judgement in all matters of taste, were qualified and entitled to
 interfere.    However it was, the time for the public sale an
 nounced for the 1st May 1 S14 was fast approaching, and no
 steps were taken for the attainment of the object, of which I wa»
 aware, beyond a few visits, which I received about that time
 from General Turner, to express the hopes of the Prince Regent,
 to whom the drawings, brought home by Mr.. North, had been
 submitted by Mr. Cockerel!, the father, that the marbles              in,
 question would be purchased; and from Mr. Planta, to express
 the same hopes on the part of the British Museum, though un
 authorized officially      by
                            the trustees.
     "  With regard to the supposed value of these marbles, as none
 had been seen in England, and scarcely any traveller of taste or
judgement who had seen them at Corfu, except Mr. North, had
 given his opinion in this country as to their relative or compa
 rative merit  ;  the only criterions that any one could go    by  were,
 first,  a comparison    between    the drawings  of  them  and the ori
 ginal works of Phidias in the Elgin collection      ;    and secondly,
 the price put upon them by the proprietors, below which          it was
 formally declared that they would not be parted with and     ;        a
  sum equal to which         was assured that one of the proprietors
  had offered to give,  if I
                           the public sale could he dispensed with, or
if   no larger sum were offered.       His price was 15,000/. or 60,000
  Spanish dollars; the collection might in fact be worth that sum,
  or more or less  ;   itwas not possible to anticipate.     However,  L
  felt confident, from the degree of merit which         it  was evident
                                                                  -
                                                                    they

 they must possess, at the sight of drawings sent home by Mr.
 R. Cockerell, a gentleman incapable of disguise, as well as" from
 the interest which must necessarily be felt in every work of
 Grecian art executed in the age of Pericles, or at least in that
 immediately subsequent ; considering likewise the general dis
 appointment aud regret which would be felt if the moment were
 lost, and they should irrecoverably get into the hands of one of
 the continental sovereigns ; I was convinced that it would be
 desirable for the cause of the arts in England, that the purchase
 should, if possible, be effected.
    " Lord Castlereagh being at this time absent on the conti
 nent, I applied forthwith to the first Lord of the Treasury, the
 Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Colonial Secretary of
 State ; and on laying before them the above considerations, I
 received from them severally their consent, that the governor of
 Zante should be authorised to effect the purchase at a public
 sale to the amount mentioned.           A messenger was immediately
 sent off, who arrived a few days previous to the sale, and the
 bargain was concluded for 60,000 dollars.
    "Was the purchase effected at 15,000/.? — The price was
 60,000 dollars ; by the course of exchange it came to 1 9,000/.
    " To what circumstance was it owing, a public sale could not
 be dispensed with } — Because the property belonged half to Ger-*
mans and half to Englishmen, and they would not allow any one,
 even of the discoverers, to make the purchase without a public
 sale.   Mr. Lee, one of the Englishmen, a gentleman of large
fortune in Warwickshire, I was assured, offered the money if he
 was allowed to take them without a public sale, and I have that
in  Mr. Cockerell's hand-writing.
    "  Do you know what the expense of bringing them to England
was ? — No, I do not; they came over in a ship of war or a trans
port, therefore I should think the expense would be very little.
    " You   mentioned that the public were disappointed respecting
the /Egina marbles ; in what way was that ? — They were dis
covered about two years before, by two English travellers and two
German travellers.        Mr. Cockerell was one of the English dis
coverers, and he wrote a detailed account of it home to his
father, and mentioned, that the value they set upon them at
Athens at that time was 6000/.         This being communicated, and
being   the subject  of  conversation   at the Dilettanti Society, Lord
Hardwicke,    who   is  a  member   of  that Society and a trustee of
the British Museum,       undertook    to  recommend to the trustees
of the British Mueseum, to request the authority of Government
to make an offer of 6000/.       The offer was made in the first in
stance through Mr. Cockerell, but on these conditions, that we
                                                                  should

                  On certain Electrical    Pheenomena.             285
should     be allowed   to bring home the marbles to England,       and
if they were found worth 6,000/. that we should have the re
fusal of them ; if not, they should be allowed to be exported,
free of duty, for any other purchaser.          This offer having ar
rived at Athens, was not accepted ; for they said it was a kind
of blind bargain; that they did not know what might become of
them.       Afterwards the British Museum sent out Mr. Combe,
the superintendant of antiquities, to Malta, to bid 8,000/. at a
sale of them expected to take place on the first of November.
 He arrived a few days before that date ; he waited the month
 of November, but no sale took place, and he left his commis
 sion with the governor of the island ; but in the mean time a
 private sale had taken place at Zante to the Prince Royal of
 Bavaria ; but notwithstanding they were sold to the Prince
 Royal of Bavaria, they were conveyed for a few months to
 Malta, for greater security : and there was a considerable diffe
 rence of opinion whether we ought not to have insisted upon a
 second sale, having been disappointed in the first sale not
 having taken place at Malta as it was publicly announced ; but
 it was ultimately determined to give up the matter.
     " Can you state what sum the Prince Royal of Bavaria gave
 for those marbles ? — I understood 6,000/.
     " Do you know of what those .^Egina marbles consisted? —
 I think there were seventeen figures with sixteen heads, which
 were found under the two pediments of the temple of Jupiter
 at JEgma.
     'c Of what
                   proportions were the figures   ? —I  should say   be

                    Esg. in Reply to Mr. Donovan.
  CUR,     M it.   Donovan     has pointed  out in the number of your
  Magazine for March, an inaccuracy of mine concerning his
  **
     Reflections on the Inadequacy of Electrical Hypotheses."         In
  the conclusion of my examination of some experiments of that
  gentleman, inserted in your number for December, I inadver
  tently stated that the
                            " Reflections," had obtained a prize from
  the Royal Irish Academy.         1 find on consulting   the page and
  volume of your Magazine to which 1 referred in a note accom
  panying my statement , that it was his
                                                " Essay on the Origin,
  &c. of Galvanism," and not the          " Reflections," that was ho
  noured with the prize. Should this unintentional mis-statement
  have been in the smallest degree offensive to the Royal Irish
  Academy or to Mr. Donovan, 1 beg leave, sir, to express my
                                                                  regret

286             On certain Electrical Phenomena.
regret at its occurrence.     I must at the same time observe, that
Mr. Donovan has also been guilty of an inadvertency, having
most strangely, hut 1 cannot believe wilfully, misrepresented
the meaning conveyed in the first part of the sentence with
which my ptiper concludes, as will evidently appear by com
paring it with the first two sentences in the second paragraph
of his answer.
    I now proceed to reply to the observations by which he at
tempts to support the correctness of his experiments, and to
invalidate the results of those which I have opposed to them.
"  Extensive reading would have shown that the electrical states
attributed     in my ' Reflections'    to the Leyden phial had not
been noticed by me alone.
    " Experimenters of great reputation had observed analogous
facts, and of this a perusal of the works of Wilson, Eeles, of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica (art. Electricity), and of various
other authorities that I now forget, will afford ample testimonv,
&c." Here it would have been well,           if,instead of making this
vague reference to authority, Mr. Donovan had specified some.
of the facts which " experimenters of great reputation had ob
served," and had shown in what maimer and to what -extent
they support his experiments.        That he should have referred to
Eeles is   singular; for, in the first place, he has in his " Reflec
tions" combated that writer's hypothesis; and secondly, as he
must be aware, his own experiments (supposing them correct)
areas irreconcilable to that hypothesis, as they are to Franklin's
 theory.   It   does not appear therefore that Eeles can render any
assistance to Mr. Donovan on this occasion         ;   and   ifhe could
have derived any from the other sources he has mentioned,           it   i<
pity he has not availed himself of it.           " The question does
not relate merely to the states of the phial, but comprises the
whole doctrine of plus and minus."            Mr. Donovan's memory
appears here to have failed him for the objections he has urged
in his " Reflections" against the doctrine of accumulation aud
                                   ;
,deficiency, are derived principally from his examination of the
 electrical states of the phial; and accordingly       itwas those ob
jections    alone   that
                      I     undertook to refute.       Hence there       is
little proprietv in the following questions which he puts in his
answer.      " Why should so limited a survey of those objections
be taken, which are all in harmony; and why need one part of
 the hypothesis be sustained when      it   isopposed   by the other ?"
 He includes here in the term         "
                                         objections" not only those he
 had made in his " Reflections," but also those    "   analogous facts''
 which, he says, " experimenters of great reputation had ob
served;" but which he did not there specify and propose ai
such; although in his answer he lumps theirs and his own to
                                                                  gether,

gether, and then complains that in my " limited survey" I did
not notice the objections of both ; when he knows that in his
u Reflections" he stated only his own objections but none of
theirs, and consequently I had only the former to notice. " The
experiments are of a delicate kind, and I stated that they only
succeed in certain states of the weather.            The period when
I made them was dry sunny weather, and I have never fori n d
them to succeed easily but in the middle of summer." Mr. Do
novan in the above sentences has endeavoured to define tive
stale of the weather in which his delicate experiments will
succeed; but unfortunately he has not accomplished his inten
tion. " The period when he made them, he says, was dry and
sunny."      Now we may have dry and sunny weather in spring,
summer, autumn, and winter; and consequently it might have
been inferred that in such a case the experiments might he
made in either of those seasons : but this inference seems to be
doubtful ; for he immediately adds, " I have never found them
to succeed easily but in the middle of summer."           Here, though
 the time or season of the year is determined, the state of the
weather is left undetermined ; for the middle of summer is not
always drv and sunny, but is sometimes dry and cloudy, and
sometimes wet and cloudy.           This uncertainty with respect to
the weather seems to have prevented Mr. Donovan from re
 peating his experiments;      but when he receives the intelligence
that they may with a liitle care be successfully performed, in
.evert/ state of the weather, on umj day in the year, and at any
hour of the day, he will doubtless be much gratified to had
that he needs not wait till midsummer to ascertain the fallacy of
 his own, or the correctness of mine.          " It is very difficult to
determine what body is positive or what negative; for positive
bodies will, under certain circumstances, attract positive bodies,
and negative bodies will attract negative."           1 deny that   it is
very  difficult to determine  what  body  is positive or what negative,
for in most cases it is extremely easy to determine it ; and if
 Mr. Donovan has really experienced any difficulty in such casee,
he has experienced it where no other electrician lias experienced
 any.     If he alludes particularly to the experiments in dispute,
 I still deny the fact ; for there are several methods by which the
 electrical states of the phial mav be ascertained with ease and
certainty.     The reason that he assigns for the above difficulty is,
 that " positive bodies will, under certain circumstances, attract
positive bodies; and negative bodies will attract negative." Let
 this be granted, and I ask, will positive bodies repel negative
 bodies, or negative bodies repel positive bodies, under any cir
 cumstances whatever ?        For, if they will not, this difficulty of
 Mr. Donovan's must vanish in a moment.             " The electrometer
                                                                       sf

of Bennet     is an instrument not to be depended on without ac
quaintance    with  a principle of electricity which I have developed,
and which in a work soon to appear will be shown to have
misled many able investigators.          Any electrometer on the same
principle, whether pith-balls or gold-leaf, is liable to the same
objection.      In the counter-experiments this error has not been
guarded against.'"'     Mr. Donovan, not satisfied with the defence
he has made for his experiments,           here turns short round upon
the innocent electrometers, and tells us they cannot be depended
on ; and yet, I believe that any of them may be more safely de
pended on than the sulphur on which he has been pleased to
place his whole reliance.        However, if he continues obstinate,
and is determined to reject their testimony, I have no objection
to his so doing; for, on re-perusing my paper, he will find that
the excited glass tube by always steadily repelling the balls con
nected with the overcharged surface of the jar, and that the ex
cited wax by always steadily repelling those connected with the
undercharged surface, afford ample evidence in my favour in
dependently of the testimony of the reprobated electrometers.
Equally steady in its testimony was the small Leyden phial
I employed, and the electrometers were only used to ascertain
the electric changes which took place in the excited electrics :
hence Mr. Donovan's attack upon the electrometers avails him
nothing, and there is little truth in the remark that
                                                                 " in the
counter-experiments! this error has not been guarded against;"
for, had the electrometers been as treacherous as he would wish
us to believe, and had I been as much deceived by employing
them in my experiments as he was by not employing them in
his, my errors would still have had no relation to the electrical
states of the phial; because they were ascertained by the faithful
and unimpeached testimony of the other instruments.

Si k,  — J. he    usual mode at present practised for endeavouring
to preserve potatoes, is to leave them alter digging exposed to
the sun and air until they are dry : this exposure generally

ciety was voted for this communication.
                                                                     causes

causes them       to have a bitter taste, and it may be remarked,
that potatoes      are never so sweet to the palate as when cooked
immediately      after digging.    I find that when potatoes are left
in large heaps or pits in the ground, that a fermentation takes,
place which destroys the sweet flavour of the potatoes. In order
to prevent that fermentation, and to preserve them from losing
the original fine and pleasant flavour, my plan is (and which ex
perience proves to me to have the desired effect) to have them
packed in casks as they are digging from the ground, and to
have the casks, when the potatoes are piled in them, filled up
with sand or earth, taking care that is done as speedily as pos
sible, and that all vacant spaces in the cask are filled up by the
earth or sand : the cask thus packed holds as many potatoes as
it would was the earth or sand used in the packing ; and as th&
vacant spaces of the cask of potatoes so packed are filled, the
air is totally excluded, and cannot act on the potatoes, and
consequently no fermentation can take place.
     I sailed from New York to St. Bartholomew's, and brought
with me two hundred barrels of potatoes packed in the above
 manner: on mv arrival at the island I found, as I expected,
 that the potatoes had preserved all their original sweetness of
 flavour, in fact, as good as when first dug, having undergone
no fermentation,       nor in the slightest degree affected by the
 bilge or close air of the ship. Some barrels of the potatoes I sold
 there, and at the neighbouring islands, *for four dollars per
 bushel : at the same time potatoes taken out in bulk without
 packing, and others that were brought there packed in casks
 which had not been filled up with earth, sold only for one dollar
 per bushel, they being injured in the passage by the bilged air
 and fermentation,      being bitter and bad, whilst mine were as
 perfectly sweet and dry as when dug: what remained I shipped
 from St. Bartholomew's to Jamaica, where they arrived in equal
 good condition, and sold at a higher price than they had brought
 at the former island : some of these casks of potatoes were put.
 in a cool cellar by the purchaser at Jamaica ; and on examining
 them when I was leaving the island two months after, I found
 that they had, in a very small degree, sprouted, but that all
 their original flavour was preserved.          Reflecting seriously on
  this discovery, suggested     to  my   mind  the idea of proposing to
 the British nation a mode of supplying their West India colonies
  with a good and wholesome food for the negroes, and also for
  the white people, and which would find an additional market
  for the farmer at home, a valuable freight for the merchant, and
  a more extended market for the lumber of the North American
  colonies, viz. of Canada, Nova Scotia, &c.
      It is well known that our ships in the West India trade         if

general go out in ballast, or not more than one-third freighted,
carrying out some small quantity of European commodities; but
the bulk of their freight consisting of empty casks, and materials
for making casks.      It is also well known how valuable a food
potatoes are in the West India islands, and how much they are
prized there: no one acquainted with the West Indies and its
commerce, but must be aware how much labour of the unfortu
nate negro is at present employed in making casks, puncheons,
&c. for bringing home the produce, and of what immense value
Casks are there. Let timber imported from our North American
colonies be made into casks, hogsheads, rum puncheons, cof
fee barrels, &e. &c. let these be filled in my mode, as described,
with potatoes, I contend, that the value of the casks which
brings out potatoes will more than compensate for their freight,
and the earth will keep the cask perfectly sweet, and ready,
without any labour, to bring home any produce.
    The potatoes must come cheap to market, the ship owner
can afford cheap freight, having now none, or next to none,
for his outward-bound vessels.
    The farmers on the sea-coast can easily supply more than two
hundred thousand tons of potatoes, and the population of the
West India islands would consume more than that quantity.
   Any overplus required may be readily supplied in like manner
in Nova Scotia, Cape Breton, Canada, &c. The food of the
negro is at present Indian corn and meal, which, with a small
quantity of potatoes now used in the islands, was formerly prin
cipally supplied by the United States, who receive in return, in
cash and produce, nearly ten millions of dollars.    Potatoes and
fish, together with the produce of the islahds, will give a much
more wholesome food, in a greater abundance, and at a more
reasonable rate.
    The policy of our legislature surely should be to encourage
the parent state and the colonies, supplying each other in every
possible manner, and to discourage aliens from reaping advan
tages from British capital, industry, and exertion, more par
ticularly so when by judicious arrangement both the colanks
and the mother country can have their wants supplied better
from their superabundant productions than from foreign states.
 Proper encouragement for the fisheries of Newfoundland, with
settlements for those employed in that part of the service on the
coast of our settlements in North America, is indispensably ne
 cessary—markets there are in abundance for the employment of
 more ships and seamen than we have now in that trade.
    By my plan of preserving potatoes, a wholesome food will be
            for the West India islands, much better and cheaper

 Ward-bound shipping, which they now want ; that by doing so
will in some measure enable the merchant to have his return
freight cheaper, and thus we do away with the idea of having
our islands dependent on the American States for food.            We
save an immense sum of money annually given to foreigners ;
and to the man of humane feeling it must be a source of grati
 fication, to see that by this mode the severe labour of the poof
black is much lightened, his condition ameliorated ; and by
having less occasion for his labour, aiding to abolish that horrid
traffic of the slave trade. We find a market never before disco
vered for our agricultural exertions, giving healthful and bene
ficial employment to many families at home and abroad, and a
saving to the nation of at least five hundred thousand pounds
 annually.                                    Chari.es Whitlow.
To C. Taylor,    M.D.    Sec.
    A communication from H. B. Wav, Esq. (printed in the same           J
volume, and for which the Society voted the Ceres silver medal,)
on the preservation of carrots during winter, corroborates the above
plan for preserving roots. The following is the substance of Mr,
Way's communication : —
    His carrots were sown broadeast in the usual way, in his garden,
March 23d, 1814, and thinned out as wanted for family use ;
and on the 20th of August following theynvere all dug up, the
greens and tops of the roots cut off and cleared from the earth
that adhered to them, and were immediately put in a dry cask,
first laying a layer of earth on the bottom of the cask, and then
a layer of carrots and earth alternately, till the whole were put in.
The cask being covered was then placed in a dry cellar, and re
mained there till sent to the Society in March 1815.           Carrots
preserved    in this way  are vastly superior  to carrots that remain
in the ground till the latter end of September or October, and then
taken up and preserved ; but they require nearly double the time
in boiling that carrots do when immediately taken out of the
ground.
    Jt appeared to the committee, on minute examination, that the
means adopted by Mr. Way for preserving carrots, is fully adequate
to the purpose ; and that where an opportunity offers of procur
ing proper casks, carrots may be preserved for many months in
this mode, either for exportation or home use, in a perfectly sound
state.

In   our last volume, p. 48, we gave an article on the Citric Acid,
extracted from this work, and in a note promised to lay before
our readers some further account of this very interesting and en
tertaining production. We hoped to have done so before this
time ; but have been prevented by a pressure of temporary subjects
which would have lost much of their utility by a delay; and
besides, Mr. Parkes's work contains so large a mass of curious and
original matter, that it required some time to make such a selec
tion as might render justice to so useful, judicious, and laborious
a  writer.
   The work consists of Fifteen    distinct Essays on the following
subjects   :
   I. On the Utility of Chemistry to the Arts and Manufactures
ef Great Britain. — II. On Temperature. — III. On the various
methods of ascertaining the Specific Gravity of Bodies. — IV. On
Calico Printing. — V. On Barytic Earth. — VI. On Carbon. —
VII. On the Manufacture of Sulphuric Acid. — VIII. On the Pre
paration and Uses of Citric Acid. — IX. On the fixed Alkalies. —
X. On the Manufacture of Earthen Ware and Porcelain. — XI. On
the Manufacture of the different kinds of Glass — XII. On the Art
and Practice of Bleaching. — XIII. On Water, and the various
Methods of its Purification. — XIV. On the Manufacture of Sal
Ammoniac. — XV. On Edge Tools, and the methods of tempering
them.
   The last volume of this interesting publication contains 250
additional notes, which are written in a perspicuous manner, and
contain so much important information as to form a very valuable
appendix to the work. A most copious and useful index, an ap
pendage too often omitted in modern works, closes the volume.
   It will not be expected that we should make extracts from
every essay; but we shall endeavour to give some of the most in
teresting and useful parts of the work, for the information and in
struction of our readers.
   In the first essay, which is on the utility of a knowledge of
chemistry to the arts, we are told that " formerly the professors
of medicine were so ignorant of the nature of the salts, that no
longer ago than the year 1765 there was a public dispute between
the celebrated Margraff and Mons. de Machy, respecting the base
#f the super tartrite of potash, whether or no it was an alkali."
                                                                 In

In one of the notes to the same           essay we are    told that      " Boer-
haave, who had a botanical garden of eight acres, and who waa
so intent upon stocking it with every exotic that he could pro -
cure, as once to have styled a present of a few American seeds
' munera auro cnriora,'
                              gifts more precious than gold, was, not
withstanding,      so captivated with chemistry, that he sometimes
spent whole days and nights successively in the study and pro
cesses of the art."
    The essay on Temperature is divided into two branches, viz.
natural and artificial.        The variety of climate in the different
regions of the earth, the effects of caloric on animal and vegeta
ble life, and the nature of its agency on combustible substances,
are arranged under the first division of the subject ; while that on
artificial temperature contains a detail of a variety of expedients
for procuring fire ; for modifying the effects of heat and cold ; for
economizing fuel; and for improving many operations which have
a considerable influence on the success of many of the manufac
tures of the country.
    In speaking of the means which have been employed by dif
ferent nations, and in different periods of the world, for producing
fire, Mr. Parkes says, " In ancient times fire was always employed
in the rites of religion ; it consumed the burnt offerings of the
Patriarchs ; was kept continually burning in the Jewish taber
nacle ; was looked upon as the origin of life *, the soul of the
world, the symbol of Deity; and considering it as the visible sign
of an invisible Being, it has from time immemorial been actually
worshipped by the Persians, and by some other Asiatic nations-)-.
    " According to Pliny, fire was for a long time unknown to some
of the ancient Egyptians ; and when Eudoxus the astronomer
showed it them, they were absolutely in raptures.                  The produc
tion of fire by collision, and the use of flint and steel                J,  were
however known long before the time of Pliny."
    In that part of the essav which relates to the subject of pro
ducing artificial cold, several chemical processes are related which
can be conducted to better advantage at a temperature beloiv
freezing than at any other; and having remarked that
                                                                      " it might
be worth while to inquire whether an ice-house might not be em-

   + The sacred (ire of the Vestal v irgins, among the Romans, was beheld by

ployed with advantage during the summer months in preserving"
meat," it is added that " from the salmon fisheries in Scotland
and the north of England, the fish are sent to the metropolis,
during the greater part of the season, packed with ice, in boxes
about four feet long and eighteen inches deep.            When packed,
the ice, which is previously broken as small as bay-salt, is put
over them and beaten down as hard as can be without bruising
the salmon.      In this manner they are kept perfectly fresh for two
or three weeks."
    In treating of the advantages which maybe derived from arti
ficial cold, Mr. Parkes recommends the use of frigorific mixtures-
to freeze occasionally the brain and the eyes of those animals
which are to undergo dissection by anatomical pupils, those parts
not being easily dissected in any other way, and informs us that
this method was first practised by the great Mr. Boyle.           In the
directions which are given for the use of saline mixtures to pro
duce artificial cold, Mr. Parkes has very properly remarked that
"  it is of consequence to have the salts fresh crystallized, thorough
ly dried, and then finely pulverized ; that the mixtures he made
rapidly, and in vessels as thin as can be procured."
    An expedient related by Mr. Parkes, and which is adopted by
people in northern regions for procuring water in winter, is
curious.     " During the winter at Hudson's Bay, the surface of
the lakes and rivers is covered with ice of such great thickness,
that no water can be procured without cutting through the ice
with axes and wedges, which is a very laborious and tedious
operation.      As soon, therefore, as the surface of the water which
has been laid open has acquired a thin plate of ice, the labourer
heaps over it a quantity of snow, which, by being a bad conduc
tor of heat, prevents the caloric of the water from passing upwards
according to its natural tendency.       Then, during- the remainder
of the winter, the inhabitants have only to remove a little of the
snow, when occasion may require         it,  and they have water im
mediately."

fuel proper for steam engine and other large iron boilers, deserves
to be noted. In such cases " sulphurous coals should be avoided,
as the sulphur which rises during combustion        apt to occasion
a rapid decay of that part of the boiler which     is is
                                                    exposed to the

   The last 100 pages of this essay are chiefly occupied in giving
directions for building stills, furnaces, chimneys, &c. and in advice
respecting the choice and management of fuel, all arising from
the author's experience in his own manufactory; but we must con*
fine our notice to a  short extract relating to the management of

       manufacture of alkalies, ash-pit-doors are of no use, as it is never
       necessary to check the fire suddenly, as in other operations. On
       the contrary, I have found it advantageous to have the ash-pits
    .  as deep, and the chimneys as high, as possible, in order to occa
       sion a strong and uninterrupted draught.          I cannot suffer this
       opportunity to pass without remarking, that the proprietors of
       reverberatory furnaces should contrive to continue their processes
       night and day ; or, if that be impracticable, they should rake up
       the fire and stop the passage to the chimney so as to prevent the
       furnace from cooling during the night.          Furnaces thus worked
      -will last six or seven times as long as those do which frequently
       stand idle.    The contraction of the materials during the time of
       cooling, and the subsequent expansion, wear them out rapidly."
       But in our estimation the most important part of this essay is
       that where the author urges the necessity of attending to tempe
       rature in the conduct of manufacturing processes. A great num
       ber of cases in corroboration of this advice are adduced, which
       are well deserving of the perusal of all practical men : see page
       341 — 382. The detail of the facts above alluded to is concluded
       in the following manner : — " I trust enough has now been offered
       to induce every manufacturer who may peruse these loose hints,
       to apply them to his own business, and to consider whether some
       of his own peculiar processes might not be very materially im
       proved by a variation of the temperature at which they have
  *
       usually been conducted.       This is the chief object I had in view
       in composing this essay; and as all the principal observations are
       founded upon experience and the best information 1 could procure,
       I entertain some confidence that it will be acceptable, and prove
       highly useful — especially to the British manufacturer."
          "  The superior knowledge of our manufacturers has been the
       great source of our excellence as a commercial nation ; but there
       is a danger, amid the growing intelligence of the age, of our losing
       this proud pre-eminence, unless some spirited individuals, in every
       class of society, aim at informing the public mind, and exciting
       that emulation among our respective artists, which is sure to
       stimulate their exertions and lead them on to perfection." These
       remarks are closed by some spirited national observations, which
•      will be read with considerable interest..
          The third essay in these volumes is entitled Specific Gravity j
       and as we do not recollect ever to have seen any treatise express
      ly on this subject, we deem it as important as any which the work
       contains.    It is well calculated to instruct young people in all the
       different modes of ascertaining the specific gravity of gasses, fluids
       and sliods. It contains some original tables for the calculation of
                                         T 4                         specific

specific gravities, and is accompanied with drawings of the dif
ferent instruments which are usually employed for that purpose.
     Essay IV. is on Calico-Printing. This essay commences with
an historical account of the various modes of staining and orna
menting linen garments from the earliest ages ; describes some
of the processes of calico-printing in India; and then the different
methods which are pursued by the calico-printers of Great Britain
and Ireland in the present day.           The managements are however
 so various, and the processes so diversified, that an attempt to
detail them here would be incompatible with our circumscribed
limits. A few extracts must therefore suffice from this essay.
     What Mr. Parkes observes respecting the use of the dung of the
 cow may be interesting to our readers, as it is new and curious.
 " When the pieces of calico have been properly stoved, they are
 passed," he says,
                         " through water at various temperatures, with
 a little cow-dung mixed in it.          The intention of the dung is to
 absorb and remove that portion of the mordant which is not ac
 tually combined with the cloth, and which otherwise might stain
 the white or unprinted parts.
     " I suspect," continues he, " the dung of the cow is servicea
 ble in another way besides that of cleansing *, though the printer
 may not be aware of the nature of its operation.                   It is ac
 knowledged       that  madder,    cochineal, and some other dyes, pro
 duce much better colours on woollen than on cotton cloths,
 owing to the former being of animal, and the latter of vegetable
 origin. I presume, therefore, that the dung imparts an animal
 matter    f  to the fibres of the cotton, and that this animal matter
 acts as an additional mordant, and thus more powerfully attracts
 the colouring particles of the dye, than the mordants alone would
 be capable of doing.         If a piece of calico, prepared with acetate
 of alumine, be divided into two parts, and the superfluous mor
  dant removed from one of them by cow- dung and water, and
  from the other by water only, though both fluids were at the same
  temperature, it will be found, on passing the two portions through
  a decoction of weld or quercitron bark, that the yellow will be
  much more intense and bright in that which had been submitted
  to the action of the cow-dung."
      The account of the advantages of cylinder printing is thus given
                          "
  by Mr. Parkes : — These machines," says he, " have not only
  the excellence of printing more correctly than can possibly be
  done by means of the block, but the saving of time and labour
  which they afford is great indeed. A piece of calico which would

                                                            may appear to be a
  strange  phrase; but as this is the technical language of the trade, no other
  could be employed -with propriety.
     t Berthollet, who analysed the dung of the cow, found in it a substance
  partaking of the nature of bile.
                                                                          take

six hours to finish with two colours, may by this means be done
in three minutes, or three minutes and a half, and then much
more completely than could even have been imagined before the
introduction of this invention."      There are many new and im
portant hints thrown out in different parts of this essav, but we
must refer our readers to the work itself for the particulars. Some
copper-plate engravings of the new apparatus accompany this
essay.
    The work before us, besides numerous known facts judiciously
selected, contains so much new, curious, and useful information,
detailed in a pleasing and popular manner, that we would will*
ingly enlarge our extracts if we could find room : but our limits
forbid this at present.

    The subject to which this volume is principally devoted, has
for some time occupied much of the public attention.          After a
short introduction, Mr. Buchanan states the peculiarities of the
Clyde navigation, that being the river on which the first at

    Mr. Taylor, of the Architectural Library, Holhorn, has just
published the Fourth Volume of the Antiquities of Athens, &c.
measured and delineated by James Stuart, F.R.S. and F.S.A.,
and Nicholas Revett, Painters and Architects; edited by Joseph
Woods, Architect.
    This volume contains 88 plates,            besides 15 vignettes, en
graved by    the  best artists,  uniformly  with  the preceding volumes;
together    with   historical   and  descriptive  accounts of the several
subjects ; also a portrait of Mr. Revett, from a picture painted
by himself, and engraved in the line manner by Isaac Taylor,
and memoirs of the lives of the authors.
    Messrs. Stuart and Revett being detained at Venice, in their
way to Athens, made an excursion to Pola, where they passed
six months in measuring the subjects, and in making the draw
ings, which are now submitted to the public; and which formed
a part of their original scheme of publication.
    The admiration with which these remains of antiquity have
always been mentioned, no less than their intrinsic merits, ren
der it desirable that they should be offered in complete detail to
the public, which has by no means been the case in any of the
works in which they have hitherto been noticed.              The subjects
are an amphitheatre,        the temple of Rome and Augustus, and
the arch of the Sergii.
    The sketch-books of Messrs. Stuart and Revett have furnished
several plates of curious fragments of ancient architecture and
sculpture found in the Greek Islands, with views of Mount Par
nassus and the Rock of Delphi.
    The exquisite sculptures which adorned the temple of Minerva
at Athens have ever been objects of the highest admiration,
and are now become particularly interesting, from the circum
stance of a large portion of them having arrived in this country.
Of these beautiful specimens of ancient art there are 34 plates,
from drawings by Mr. Pars, representing the entire west frieze
of the cell, with some parts of the north and south sides, and
several of the metopes of the exterior frieze. These, with those
already published in the second volume of this work, exhibit all
the sculpture which remained of the temple at the time (1751)
Stuart and Revett were at Athens. Amongst these are five
plates, showing the state of the sculpture in the pediments in
the year 1683, when visited by the Marquis de Nointel, from
copies of the original drawings in the King's library at Paris.

   " If a mass of any moderately soluble salt be suspended in a
vessel of water, we may shortly observe that it is not equally
acted upon by the fluid. We shall perceive that it has been more
 dissolved toward the upper than the lower part, and the whole
 piece will assume, more or less, the form of a cone, with the apex
at the surface of the liquid.      The particles of water which are in
immediate contact with the salt combine with a portion of        it,and
thus becoming specifically heavier than the remainder, sink to
the bottom of the vessel        others succeed, and follow the same

form produced by the cause above described, the surface of a
body is never equally acted upon by a solvent.         Striae or ridges
 may be detected in various places, and, indeed, generally cover
 the whole of its superficies, which prove, not only that the me
 chanical attraction of the solid has resisted chemical action, but
 that it has resisted it more in some directions than in others.
 The following expeiiments, which only require time and moderate
 attention, while they give determinate results, are explanatory, at
 once, of the. cause and progress of the phenomena.
    " If we immerse an amorphous mass of alum in water, and
 set it by in a place where it may remain undisturbed for a period
 of three or four weeks, at the expiration of that time we shall
 find that it has assumed the pyramidal form before described.
 Upon a further examination, we shall observe that the lower end
 of the mass presents the form of octohedrons and sections of oc-
 tohedrons, as it were, carved or stamped upon its surface. These
 figures will be high in relief, and of various dimensions. — They
 will be most distinct at the lower extremity, becoming less so as
 they ascend, till at length they are totally obliterated.
    " A continuation of the process, however, would evidently re
 solve the whole into similar figures, their cessation arising solely
 from that superior power of solution which subsists in the upper
stratum of the liquid.
    " These crystalline forms are produced when the water is par*
tially saturated with the salt, and acting with diminished energy
is nearly counterbalanced by its mechanical structure; and we
are thus put in possession of the important fact, that this latter
power does not merely act, as has been hitherto supposed, in the
grosser forms of aggregation, but in the more complicated and
delicate arrangements of crystalline polarity.
    " This regular structure is developed both when we employ an
amorphous mass and a regular crvstal, proving that the ultimate
arrangement of particles is the same in both ; and that the like
disposition exists, both when the slowness of approximation has
bounded the solid with symmetric planes, and when the sudden
ness of the condensation has forced the aggregated molecules into
a more contracted space.
    " This new process of dissection admits of more extensive ap
plication than might at first be imagined, and we are thus fur
 nished with a method of analysing crvstalline arrangements, which
 promises to lead to important results.       The geometrical figures
produced by     these  means,   are not  less  determinate when the
process has    been  carefully conducted,    than  those which result
from the common methods of crystallization ; and they are the
 more instructive, inasmuch as we are presented in the same group
with an extensive series of modifications, and decrements of the
                                                              primitive

primitive form, which shew by their relative position,          and mu
tual connexion,      the gradual steps by which one form passes into
another."
    Borax, crystals of sulphate of copper, sulphate of magnesia,
submitted to cautious solution, also yielded distinct crystalline
forms.      Crystals of carbonate of lime, carbonate of barytes, a
crystal of quartz, and a polished carnclian, submitted cautiously
to the action of their proper solvents, gave similar indications,
but rendered less perfect, in some instances, by extricated gas
making paths for its escape along the surface of the crystal, and
there preventing the regular action of the acid. Bismuth, nickel,
antimony, and some other metals gave evidence also of regular
crystallization. — The author, after detailing these experiments,
proceeds to inquire
                           " whether this new method of analysis may
not be calculated to throw some light upon crystalline arrange
ments in general ?" He then describes particularly the crystalline
forms brought to view on the surface of the piece of alum, with
a view to a proper theory which may agree with all the results.
    " It is evident," he remarks, " that no general theory of crys
tallization can be applied to the cases under contemplation, which-
is not founded upon such a disposition of constituent particles as
 may furnish all the modifications of form before described, by the
 mere abstraction of certain individuals from a congeries, without
altering the original relative position of* those which remain.
That is to sav, supposing we adopt the hypothesis of the spheri
cal form of the molecules, it will not be sufficient that a cube
 may be constructed by the superposition of four balls upon the
 top of four other balls *, and an octohedron hy placing four
spheres in a square, with two others in the interstices between
 them (in which two combinations          it is evident that the position
 of no three particles is alike) ; but the disposition of the cube
 must include that of the octohedron,           and this latter must be
 obtainable by the equal abstraction of certain members of the
 former, without interfering with the quiescent state of the re
 mainder."
     He then assumes, for inquiry, the sphere as the form of the

 their relative position, and to prove whether by the abstraction
 of certain rows or quantities of spheres from the mass, without
 disturbing those that are left, the mass or any portion of it can

every substance.        If we suppose two nuclei to be formed in any
solution, in such    a    manner that the axis of one shall run in a
contrary    direction  to  the axis of the other, each will of course at
tract a particular system of particles from the surrounding medium.
Should the two, therefore, come in contact, a greater number
will be collected at the point of junction than at any other, and
they will therefore arrange themselves in the least passible space.
Accordingly we find, that whenever         a   crystal   isattached to an
other, in such a manner that their axes run in contrary direc
tions, if   we pull the two asunder, we shall invariably be presented
with  a   regular hexagonal arrangement at the point of junction,

peatedly     verified upon carbonate of lime, selenite, fluor-spar,
quartz, topaz, and other mineral bodies.
    "   The foregoing experiments and observations are offered in
support of the ingenious theory of Dr. Wollaston, whose simple
and satisfactory elucidation of the principles of crystalline ar
rangement has solved the difficulties, and remedied the incon
sistencies of all previous explanations of the phenomena.        Former
hypotheses, however laborious in their construction, were defec
tive, and unsatisfactory in the fundamental data of their arrange
 ment, and were incompetent even to explain the solitary fact from
which they originally emanated.
     "  This, however, is found to stand the test of experiment, as
 far as it is applicable from the nature of the subject ; and another
 analogy is thus opened to the admirers of the simplicity and
-beautiful connexion of the order of the universe, who will recog
nise, in the invisible and scarcely imaginable atoms of a crystal,
 the same forms which in incomprehensible magnitude roll their
 majestic courses in the planetary system."

     8. On Aqua regia, or Nitro- muriatic Acid : By Sir H. Davy.
-—Strong nitrous acid, saturated with nitrous gas, and mixed
 with a saturated solution of muriatic acid gas, produces no other
*fFect than might be expected from the action of nitrous acid of
 the same strength on an equal quantity of water : the acid so
 formed has no action on gold or platina. Equal volumes of mu
riatic acid gas and nitrous gas being mixed over mercury, and
half a volume of oxygen being added, the condensation will only
 be what might be expected from the formation of nitrous acid
 gas; and when decomposed or absorbed by the mercury, the mu
 riatic acid gas, unaltered, is found mixed with a portion of nitrous
 gas.
          " It appears then, that nitrous acid and muriatic acid gas
 have no action on each other." The mixture of colourless nitric
 acid and muriatic acid of commerce is yellow, and dissolves gold
 and platinum.       If gently heated, it gives off pure chlorine, and
 becomes deeper coloured; if the heat be continued, chlorine still
 rises, but mixed with nitrous acid gas, which may be separated
 from    it by a small quantity of water.      If heated  till no more

March 28 and April 4.       The reading of Dr. Thos. Thomson's,
paper   on Phosphoric  Acid  was  continued.    In the series of ex
periments   which  the author  had  undertaken     to ascertain with
precision the weight of an atom of phosphorus, he noticed se
veral combinations of acids which had not hitherto attracted the
attention of chemists, and to which he gave new names. But as
he did not pursue his analysis to the extreme in every case, he re
served his detailed observations on some of them for a future
paper, his chief object being to detect the combinations of phos
phorus.     Many of his conclusions are the result of calculation
on the previously-known combinations of atoms of oxygen with
different bodies, rather than of direct experiment.          In some
cases his experiments did not correspond with his pre-conceived
theory of atomical combination, and then he readily abandoned
the accuracy of the former to the supposed infallibility of the
latter. Nevertheless he found, beyond doubt, that phosphorus
combines with lime in six different proportions        ;arid that, as
three  of these combinations  could not  be  multiples, they were in
direct opposition    to the atomic theory so pompously announced

by Berzelius.     Hence be concluded that the Swedish Professor
has   established    his canons rather too hastily, and from data
which, however they may correspond with the chemical phae-
nomena of six or eight salts, are incompatible with the facts
relative to nearly a hundred others.      Dr. T. operated chiefly on
bones, and the phosphat of lime which they contain : in opera-'
ting he followed the process proposed by Eckberg in 1795, and
preferred the deflagrating of phosphorus in oxygen, to every
Other mode of ascertaining their relative combinations.     But his
apparatus being small, his experiments were often made on the
combustion of a single grain of phosphorus in oxygen gas.

as an appendix to his remarks on the effects of certain medicines

their efficacy is entirely owing to their action on the circulation

suggested to him to try the effects of his gout medicine thrown
directly into the blood without the intermedium of the stomach.
With this view 160 grains were injected into the veins of a dog,
when the animal in a few minutes became convulsed, his pulse
lowered, respiration difficult, had evacuations, and in five hours
died.    On opening the stomach it was found inflamed, and the
whole appearances were exactly the same as if the poison had
been taken into the stomach.        Sir E. considers this a demon
stration, as far as it is possible in such a case, of the truth
of his theory.

    A Report by Dr. Granville, on     a Memoir of M. Methuon, on
the   Mode   in which earthy and metallic Crystals, not of a saline
Nature, are formed, was read on the 16th Feb.
    " Crystals, according to Mons. Methuon, are not the imme
diate consequence of undisturbed solution or fusion ; but the
produce of a peculiar decomposition of amorphous crystallizable
masses, the particles of which arrange themselves, during de
composition, according to certain laws of attraction ; the process
being carried on in the dry way, and in the air."
     About twelve years ago, while engaged in some mineral pur
suits in Elba, his attention was directed to a block of argil
 laceous schhtus ivith pyrites, which appeared to have been re
 cently detached from a stratum of that substance, forming the
basis of a large mass of sandstone projecting from one of the
sides of the mountain.        On examining it he found that several
capillary crystals of alum from \ to f of an inch in length co
vered its superior surface.     This as well as the lateral sides of
the stone were in an evident state of decomposition more or less

advascsd, to thft depth of 1 | ifoch . There Witt some dust lying if*
the intervals between the crystals, which he blew off; and he ob
served that the wind had previously scattered some of it around
the stone a% it lay on the earth.       Struck with this singular ap
pearance, and almost instantaneously seizing the hint from na
ture, Mons. Methuon raised with sticks an appropriate shelter,
under which he placed the mineral, and frequently paid a visit
to the apparatus.      The elongation of the crystals and the ac
companying      decomposition   of the stone, became every day more
visible,  until, at the end  of two months, the former were nearly
double in size,    and the latter  had increased in proportion.
    "This discovery of the alum," exclaims M. Methuon, "being
formed in the air, and not in water, made a strong impression
tipdn me, and I confess I could not forbear thinking there existed
Some analogy between this formation, and that of the earthy and
 metallic crystals not of a saline nature.      It was evident, indeed,
 that the alum, in this case, did not exist in the rock, but was
 the immediate effect of its decomposition ; that a portion of the
 sulphur from the pyrites passed into the acid state by means of
its contact with the atmospheric air ; and that this acid, com
 bining with the argil, formed the crystals of arum."
    He repeated his observations, multiplied his experiments, and
instituted more particular inquiries in the island, which led, he
 savs, to a discovery of recent crystals formed from a decomposi
 tion of the amorphous masses in which they were implanted.
 f( Nay, at one time, he seems to have caught nature in the
                                                                   very
 act of forming crystals of quartz on a mass of silico-calcareous
 earth, from the surface of which M. Methuon had carefully re
moved all signs of pre-existing crystallization.           The author
marked the spot well, and left it. After a few weeks, some small
 points of rock-crystal made their appearance ; by degreed 'the
 pyramidal summits were formed ; and these were gradually fol
lowed by the prism ; its mass diminishing in size, as the crystal
became more and more diaphanous.            At the end of three-and-
twenty months, the period at which M. Methuon quitted the
island, there were six beautiful crystals of quartz, from      f   tof
of an inch in length, and     -J-of an inch in diameter; the silicO-
calcareous stone around them being excavated ih the same pro
portion.     But a fluid seemed, in this instance, to have had a
part in the formation of these crystals     ;for, although the locality
of the fossil producing them           described to have been beyond
                                    is is
the reach of the waves, yet    it     admitted that their spray, par
ticularly  in tempestuous weather, often bedewed its exposed sur
face.
   "  In a similar manner did M. M. obtain crystals of yenile,
some specimens of which he has preserved to' this moment."

    Afterwards in Piedmont, "on removing some indistinct crystals
 of alalile and garnet, which he had discovered on breaking an
 amorphous mass of those substances, and on taking the proper
 precautions, consisting in throwing some loose earth and stones
 iagainst the surface from which the crystals had been removed ;
 after the lapse of six years, M. M. had the satisfaction of gather-
 a second and a third crop of new beautiful crystals, formed du
 ring that period, some of which were sent to the public institu
tions at Paris.
    Having transported some of the shapeless mass of alalite,
garnet, green idocrase, f/i/roxene, and amorphous pyrites; and
formed with them an'artiricial mountain, which was placed on
the chimney-piece in his room; after many days and weeks of
 anxiety, he had at last the pleasure of seeing crystals of all these
 substances emerge from this heterogeneous mixture.            " The
first," says the author, " which I had the satisfaction of seeing
 on my artificial mountain, were small prisms of pyroxene; nest
 came the summits of crystals of alalile, then planes of garnet,
 after which those of idocrase and peridot followed in succes
 sion."
    To produce new crops of crystal from cabinet specimens, was
 the next attempt.       In July 1814 three specimens of idocrase,
 properly examined and described, were delivered to him from
 the School of Mines, and in November were submitted to the
crystallizing process. In April 1813 new crystals were found
 on the surface of each of the specimens.
    From a number of similar facts M. Methuon conceives       "  that
the natural process of crvstallization originatlv begins in a par
 tial decomposition of the surface of a crystellizalle fossil; that
from certain spots of this surface, where it has first begun, the
decomposition proceeds in straight and narrow lines to other
 similar spots which in their turn send forth similar lines, some
times parallel to the former, at other times crossing each other ;
 thus dividing, or, more commonly speaking, carving or engraving
 the surface of the fossil into several compartments,     which be
 come, by a continuance of the process of decomposition, as many
 distinct pieces, constituting the body of the crystal in its rough
state ; and lastly, that during this process the substances of a
different nature, contained in the mineral, separate, and arrange
themselves, in one or more parts of the same compartment, the
fossil mass continuingto be solid and hard, but fragile and easy to
^be broken;" the author having often broken, between his fingers,
 some which had before withstood the strongest percussions.
    M. Methuon maintains that lie has proved : " 1st, That cry
stals begin to form at their summit, edges, and solid angles,

    Experiments made at Woburn Abbey for determining the Pro
portion between the Load and Draught of Horses in Waggons.
The instrument employed was contrived by Mr. Salmon of
Woburn.      One general result was, that in a four-wheeled wag
gon of the ordinary construction, on a good road and on a hori
zontal plane, the draught is between a 25th and a 30th of the
load.     With a load of one ton the draught is between 75 and
80 pounds.      Several other results were deduced.
    Account of a Chromatic Thermometer, by Dr. Brewster.         This
instrument is founded on a newly discovered action of heat upon
glass.    Glass is thrown into a transient state of crystallization
during the propagation of heat through its mass. When in this
state it acts on polarized light like crystallized bodies, and pro
duces various orders of colours in different parts of the glass-
plate.    The number of fringes increases, or the tints rise in
 Newton's scale, as the temperature of the source of heat is in
creased ; so that the difference between the temperature of the
glass and that of the source of heat, is measured by the num
ber of the fringes, or the nature of the tints which are developed.
As every tint in the scale of colours has an accurate numerical
value, differences of temperature may be measured with the ut
most correctness, from the lowest temperature up to those at
 which glass begins to lose its solidity.
    The heat of the hand applied to a single plate of glass three-
 tenths of an inch thick, produces a perceptible effect in crystal
lizing the plate ; so that, if ten plates were employed, a difference
 of temperature, equal to one-tenth of that which was applied to
the single plate, will be distinctly appreciable.

 plication of the Calculation of Probabilities to Physics.        The
 extracts referred particularly to the figure of the earth as de
 duced from the vibrations of pendulums.        He finds from thirty-
 seven of the best experiments on the length of the seconds pen
 dulum in different latitudes, that the increase of gravity from the
 equator to the poles, follows the law which theor\ points out as
 the most simple ; and concludes that the density of the earth
 must augment regularly from the surface to the centre ; and'
 hence he infers the original fluidity of the whole — a state, he
 adds, which nothing but excessive heat could produce.           [This
fluidity may be allowed without admitting the cause he has as-

    An Account of the Sleeping Woman of Dunninald, near Mon-»

from the 27th to      the  30th   of June IS 15.   Nest morning she
again fell into a sleep which lasted seven     days — without motion,
food, or evacuation.       At the end of this time, by moving her
hand and pointing to her mouth, it was understood she wanted
food, which was given to her ; but she remained in her lethargic
state still the Sth of August,— six weeks in all, without appear
ing to be awake, except on the 30th of June.          Her pulse for the
first two weeks was about 50; the third week GO; and pre
 vious to recovery it was at 70 to 72. Though extremely reduced,
 she gained strength so rapidly that before the end of August she
worked regularly at the harvest. This case is well authenticated.
    In a paper on Barometers, by Mr. Playfair, iron tubes are
recommended for barometrical observations in mountainous or
remote countries.       The tubes being trulv bored, and of the pro
per length, the mercury is to be poured into them at the place
of observation.      A finger being then placed on the orifice, the
 tube  inverted in  a cup of mercury, and being again stopped with
 the finger (after  all oscillation has ceased) and withdrawing the
cup, the quantity in the tube will give the result.       The quantity
may be measured by means of a graduated float.

Analysis of the Labours of the Class                   t,f   Mathematical           and
   Physical Sciences for the Year 1815.                 By M. Cuvier.
                                CHEMISTRY.
    We have during the last two years spoken of those acids with
out oxygen, or, as they are now called, kydracids, which have
made such a considerable breach         the imposing edifice of the
                                          in
chemical theory of Lavoisier. The labours of M. Gav-Lussac
Iiave this year proved that there    one more to add to this class:
                                      is
that which M. De Morveau had called prussic acid, because                            it
enters into the composition of Prussian blue, and because, its ra
dical not being known,       was not possible then to derive from
                              it
that source its denomination.
    The experiments of Margraaf, Bergman, and Scheele, did not
admit of    doubt that .in Prussian blue the iron was unitad with
              a
a  substance which performed the part of an acid.     M. Berthol-
let had suspected however for      long
                                     a   time that oxygen did not
enter into its composition, but merely carbon, azote and hydro-i
gen  ; and this suspicion has been changed into        certainty   a                 by
Gay-Lussac.
   On decomposing, with the precautions which he points out,
the prussiate of mercury the hydrochloric (otherwise muriatic)
                               by
acid, he obtained pure prussic acid            ;  and we have already
spoken in one of our preceding reports of the singular properties
which he found in      it in this state, and chiefly of its extreme vo
latility.      On afterwards, burning the vapour of this acid                        by
oxygen and the electric spark, he obtained determinate quan
tities of water, carbonic acid and azote. The oxygen consumed,
in  the production of the two first of these substances         wanting;is
and  it  follows from this conclusion, that one volume of vapour
of prussic acid results from the combination and concentration
of one volume of vapour of carbon, half volume of azote, and
                                                   a
half volume of hydrogen
     a                          ;   or,  by expressing these volumes                 by
weights, according       to  the density  of each of these vapours, 100
parts   of  acid contain       44'39    carbon
                               51 '71 azote
                                 8-90 hydrogen.
    Thus the prussic acid contains more azote and less hydrogen
than the other animal substances, from which                  it
                                                              particularly
                                                                   is
distinguished     by  the total absence of oxygen.
    This  is  the first hydraoid known, the radical of which           de      is
composable;       and this radical M. Gay-Lussac also succeeded in
obtaining freed from its hydrogen.           Not being able to preserve
this epithet of prussic, which belongs only to an accident, he has
given    itthe appellation of cyanogene (that          to say, producing
                                                        is

of hydrocyanates    ; and the combinations of its radical, that of
cyanures.
    We would fain give un account of the numerous and c'elicate
experiment;; by whicji M. Gay-Lussac referred to the one or
the other of these classes the various products resulting from
the action of the prussic acid on bodies, and all the properties
which he has brought to light; but our limi ts do not admit of
it. Sufnce it to say, that Prussian blue in particular seems to
him to be rather a cyanure of iron which has retained water,
than a kydrocyanat, or, as it was formerly called, a pni^iate.
   This cyanogene, considered by itself, presented some remarka
ble properties: it is a permanent elastic fluid, the density of which
to that of the air is as 1. 8064 to 1, of a peculiar pungent smell,
giving a sharp taste to water, and burning with a purple flame.
Water absorbs four times its volume, and alcohol 23 : its direct
analysis gave the same result with that of the hydrocyanic acid,
i. e. one volume of vapour of carbon for half a volume of azote.

    COMMUNICATIONS       RESPECTING     SIR H. DAVv's SAFE-LAMP.
H aving     learnt by the Newcastle newspapers that a deputation
from the coal-owners of the rivers Tyne and Wear, &c. had
waited on Sir Humphry Davy, on his return from Scotland
through Newcastle, in the end of March, to express to him
their opinidh of the merits of his invention for guarding the
lives of miners against the effects of fire-damp explosions, and
to thank him for the benefits thus conferred on humanity ; we
were anxious to be enabled to give all the publicity in our power
to such an unquestionable testimony, as being the most satis
factory reply to the animadversions which appeared in another
periodical work on the observations which we have before made
on this most important discovery.           We could not for obvious
reasons request Sir Humphry to furnish us with the documents
wanted. We applied to the chairman of the meeting alluded to,
and our request met with that prompt attention which we an
ticipated. The facts are briefly these : A deputation from the
coal owners addressed the following note

 fire-damp from a stratum of stone.          In approaching the con
 fines of the foul air, the flame of the wick increased in bulk,
 and by progressively advancing,       the wire cylinder  first became
filled with flame from the explosive mixture, and at last the
whole extinguished without producing the least flame on the
exterior of the wire.      These experiments were frequently re
peated   with   the same effect.   We then proceeded to the Trial
Inbanks, where we have for many months been, working with
steel-mills, not daring to introduce a candle on account of the
quantity of fire-damp generated.           In these places the sapae
safety and effects were found as in Russia drift, to the great as?
tonishment of the workmen employed.

cept from the repeated proof of its security, to look at, it ap
pears incredible.
    "  In all places where danger is the least suspected, there can
be no doubt the lamp will be absolute security if properly ap-.
plied, and in a little time it will become in general use. The
light produced from the lamp (trimmed with spermaceti oil) was
quite sufficient for the ordinary purposes of working. The thank?
of miners must ever be given to Sir Humphry Davy for this
momentous discovery.         I have the honour to be, &c.

    We have great pleasure in stating that the coalrtrade has l\b&r
rally presented 100 guineas tq Mr. Stevenson, of Killingworth
Colliery, for his ingenious lamp described in a preceding number
of the Philosophical Magazine, which, though superseded by Sir
Humphry Davy's more perfect invention, not only evinced great
ingenuity, but promised much comparative safety to the miners.
    The public have been amused within the last few weeks, by a
boy with extraordinary calculating powers, who is exhibited by
his friends in the Great Room at Spring Gardens, : Perhaps the
following short account of the calculating phenomenon of Eng
land, as he is called, will be a satisfaction to our readers.
    George Bidder was born in a cottage at Morton Hampstead,
twelve miles from Exeter, Devonshire, on the 14th of June 1806.
His father William Bidder, a hard-working mason, principally
occupied in making the stone fences with which that country
abounds, has seven children, four boys and three girls: the boys
assist the father, girls at service ; George, the youngest but two,
whose time was employed as country children's are, went to a
three-halfpence a-week school till seven years old, when the first
proof he gave of his extraordinary abilities was in reckoning the
nails in a horse's four shoes, and by degrees doubling them frpm
a farthing 32 times ; this brought on other questions, when his

                              Mental Calculation.
ready replies induced his father to make a tour to the principal
towns : Bristol, Liverpool, Birmingham, Bath, Cambridge, &c.
&c. where he gave universal satisfaction.        In London he ap
peared before the Dukes of Kent and Sussex, Lord Stanhope,
Sir Joseph Banks, and the priucipal nobility and gentry. Her
Majesty having signified her commands, he appeared before her
and the three Princesses at Windsor, and answered the question*
proposed to him by the Bishop of Salisbury, without the least
agitation or hesitation, so quickly and correctly, as highly to
please Her Majesty, who made him a handsome present.               He
continues to improve in his calculations, and solves very difficult
questions in a manner to astonish and delight the company.
 He is just now learning to write; figures he cannot make, nor is
it intended he should be taught yet — Lord Stanhope, who has
 much noticed him, advising his friends against                   it,
                                                         as fearing                   it
 may in some measure interfere with that intuitive faculty he at
 present possesses; and certainly the knowledge of figures could
not make him more ready than he now is.
    The following, among many others, are questions he has cor
rectly answered      :
   1.   Suppose a cistern capable of containing 170 gallons, to
receive from one cock 54 gallons, and at the same time to lose
 by leakage 30 gallons in one minute; In what time will the said
 cistern be full ?
    2. How many drops are there in         pipe of wine, supposing
                                                a

 and 126 gallons in       pipe

     It appears by Messrs. Lean's Report for March 1816, that the
  average work of thirty-five engines was 19,720,466 pounds of
  water lifted one foot high with each bushel of coals consumed ;
  that Woolf's engine at Wheal Var, during that month, lifted
  48,432,702       pounds, and his engine at Wheal Abraham

Meteorological Observations made in Scotland, principally at
           Edinburgh, from March \8t!i to April VSth 1816.
    March 18. — (At Sterling) Showers with wind from the north

    March 19. — Sky chiefly obscure with less wind, fair calm
evening.        Wind again at night. Dark night.
    March 20.— Fair day with cumuli, &c. and little wind. Dark
Bight.
     March 21. — Showery weather returned, with fair intervals j
temperature moderate.
     March 22. — Obscure and windy.,
    March 23. — Fair day, and sky chiefly clear with cumulus, &c,
     March 24. — Obscure and calm, followed by whistling wind
 sweeping dust along.
     March 25 — 29 *. —Obscure in general, but dry and with wind
 in gales.
                                                                     March
    * On    the evening of the 97th being on the hills above Edinburgh about
  4§ o'clock,   I noticed a great clearness in the windward, i.e. east; while
 the town to the westward and southward was involved in thick mist. This
                                                                         mu•c

   March 30, 3 1 .—-Fair with gales blowing along clouds of dust ;
wanecloud and stackencloud, &c. but no distinct appearances of
tain.
   April    1. — Obscure    but fair day ; with gentle gnles.
   April    2.-^-Fair gray day, cloudy with gales at night from the
southward.       The dust became troublesome, and there was a
whistling noise in the wind which often forebodes rain ; with a
ring or corona about the moon.
   April 3, 4, 5.— Cloudy and in general obscure, with fine in
tervals and light gales of wind. I did not pay particular attention
to the weather these three days, being otherwise engaged.
   April 6. — Towards evening gentle showers of rain. The at
mosphere cold and winterlike.            The crocus vernalis in flower in
an inclosed piece of ground in the middle of Edinburgh Old
Town.
   April 7. — Rainy morning. Jt cleared toward noon, but showers
returned again from the northward at 2 p. m.
   April 8. — Showery weather, with snow and sleet and cold. I
was very sensible of the difference between the weather here and
that in England, particularly in the southern parts at this time
of the year.
   April 9. — Fine spring-like day, Btackenclouds or cumuli, with
wanecloud in the afternoon.           The distances were clear to wind
ward ; but the crows about the seashore near Leith and Portobello
flew about, alighting frequently near the water's edge, and uttering
a hoarse and frequent cry — an indication of rain noticed byAratusj
and which was verified on the morrow.
   April 10. — Obscure and rainy day; it held up for a very short
time now and then.          Air cold, and windy from N.W.
                —
   April 11. Clouds and a great deal of small rain. Fine at
night.
   April    12. — Warmer in the morning, and the clouds lofty with
breaks,    through which the sun came out.              Cold wind again at
night.
   April    13. — Clear morning, showers of snow succeeded, but it
did not lie on the ground.            Towards evening a strong N.W.
wind blew, and it became clear and very cold, with a frosty night.

most have arisen partly from the smoke from the chimneys of the houses,
but not entirely, as I noticed that Leitli was partially invoked in mistiness,
and partially clear; and that the misty places changed, so that the fallcloud
causing the misty appearance appeared to travel along with the wind.         I
have observed that Edinburgh       is more misty in proportion to the wind
blowing than any other place    I have yet seen.

1.XIV. On Aerial Navigation.        By Sir George Cavlev, Bart.
                            F.R.S., &c.
                          To  Mr. Tilloch.
         I
Sir, — am glad to see the subject of aerial navigation noticed
by Mr. Lovel Edgeworth, and likewise by a gentleman under the
signature of T. H. in your Magazine for March last.                Mr.
William Bland has likewise written an ingenious paper upon this
subject in the Monthly Magazine for March.           I wish to bring
all those who interest themselves in this invention, to act in
concert towards its completion, rather than to be jealous of each
other respecting their own share of credit as inventors : indeed,
unless we can realize our object, verv little credit will be due to
these speculations.    Mr. Edgeworth, who upon good grounds
puts in so early a claim to a knowledge of the principle of
steering balloons by the inclined plane, has quite misconceived
the nature of the principle upon which my former papers upon
the subject of aerial navigation were founded, when he             that
" Sir George Cayley has frequently proposed to impelsaysflying
bodies by letting them descend obliquely through the air, and
forcing them in a contrary obliquity against the air by impelling
them upwards,"       My plan rested upon the following fact : that
if a plane of any given magnitude, say 100 square feet, were
placed so as to make any small angle with an horizontal line,
suppose an inclination of one to ten ; then, if it were propelled
forward in the horizontal path, like a bird in the act of skim
ming, by a force of ten pounds, till the horizontal resistance of the
air equalled this pressure, the plane would have power to sustain
one hundred pounds weight during its progress.          I proposed to
create this slight horizontal pressure by the power of a light
first mover, several of which were there alluded to, particularly
one where the combustion of oil of tar was made use of as the
moving power. This engine had been exhibited in a working state
to Mr. Rennie, Mr. Cartwright, and other gentlemen capable of
appreciating its powers ; and it appeared from the minutes of
Mr. Chapman, civil engineer of Newcastle, that eighty drops
raised eight hundred weight the height of twenty- two inches;
hence "a horse power may consume from ten to twelve pounds
per hour.    The expense of power, however, with this engine
being much greater than with the steam-engine, the patentee
never proceeded further than the original experiments. From this
statement it is plain that the tacking operation alluded to by
Mr. Edgeworth, — by "impelling them upwards," and then
letting gravity operate in the descent, — was not any part of my
plan, although, being acquainted with the principle    '    of oblique

forces, and not having a proper first mover, I was obliged to
try the experiments as to steadiness and steerage by merely al
lowing the vessel to sail from the top of a hill ; and it was to
this circumstance that I alluded in my observations upon Mr.
Evans's paper, the descending half of the movement that gentle
man proposed being perfectly similar to, and therefore corrobo
rated by my experiments.
    I have related this matter more minutely, because Mr. Edge-
worth's statement rather gave me a claim to the principle of
steering balloons by means of the inclined plane, which 1 do not
possess.     Indeed I hold it perfectly in my recollection, (although
I cannot state either the name of the party or the publication
in which- 1 read the account,) that an ingenious young man se
veral years ago had tried some successful experiments on the
steerage of balloons by the inclined plane, but had died before
he completed his invention.
    Should this subject gain importance by experimental success,
this, and no doubt many other claims of various kinds, will be
attempted to be placed over the heads of those gentlemen, who
now will, I hope, have the more substantial credit of realizing
 and perfecting the invention for the uses of mankind.                For my
own part, I shall sue for no share in the scramble respecting
 Montgolfier balloons, but that of braving the risible muscles
 of my friends in -substituting acres for yards of cloth in their
 structure, unless indeed it be for the addition of a chimney, a
 most common, natural, and in this case particularly useful ap
 pendage to a fire.       I shall however be extremely gratified in
 being able to claim the credit of standing on the same list with
 Mr. Edgeworth as a subscriber towards completing this noble
 art ; — with this view I request Mr. THloch to be kind enough
 to permit a list of subscriptions to remain at his house till a few
 names be collected and a committee appointed*; — no one to be
 called upon for bis subscription monev till such a sum be sub
 scribed for as will be sufficient to try the first experiment pro
 posed by the committee.
     In my last paper it was stated that I had made some calcu
 lations relative to the quantity of fuel that would be consumed
 in propelling the Montgolfier balloon there described, at a ve
locity of twenty miles per hour, by the steam-engine. According
 to the returns made of the Cornwall engines, Mr. Woolf's
 engine raises about fifty millions of pounds, one foot high, with
 a bushel or eighty-four pounds of coal.             Hence I estimate that
 twenty pounds of coal per mile would be consumed in this ope-

 maj wish to contribute to an experiment of the kind recommended. — A. T.

ration, and therefore the expense would not be considerable. —
But as no more than 6S00 pounds, the unconsumed power of
this balloon, can be allowed for the weight of the engine, its wa
ter and fuel, besides that of an extensive surface for Wafting, it
appears upon estimating the weight of these things*, that
this balloon, extensive as it       is,is, as  Ibefore said, only the long
boat of its species, and not quite large enough to take advantage
of the saving power of the steam-engine at so great                  velocity
                                                                     a
as twenty miles per hour        : though       will answer the purpose of

a first experiment at fifteen miles per hour with            aproportionate
saving of fuel.
    Upon larger constructions, however,              will appear that aerial
                                                        it
navigation      will  be   performed      much    cheaper in a horizontal
path       by
            the steam-engine, than upon the ascending and de
scending plan with the inclined plane.             Several years ago madeI
many estimates of the application of first movers to these long
balloons but;    I   always found that the enormous size required to
be successfullv driven by them, placed the proper scale of ex
periments quite out of the reach of any individual, and unfor
tunately of such magnitude as to render the public of that day,
if  appealed to, more incredulous than ever upon the subject. My
own experiments were therefore confined to the inclined plane,
which offers     a   good result upon a smaller construction.              The
introduction of the steam-boat, together with " the steady march
 of the human mind" during so many years of unexampled
 scientific discovery, attended            practicable results in the rapid
                                          by
 improvement of almost every art, will now enable me to state
 my ideas upon this subject, without stepping beyond the limits
 of many an inquiring mind.             My former paper showed that the
 Montgolfier balloon there described was only the long-boat of
 this class of vessels ;    yet I  felt obliged to pave the way for the
 introduction of so huge an infant obtruded upon the civilized
 world,     byleading the unprepared mind from the contemplation
 of    hundred-gun       ship of ninety yards in length, to            balloon

 proper movement when the machine was at anchor to the earth
 from some point under the prow.          It ought likewise to be ob
 served, that, owing to the internal pressure there will be exerted
 a power of about 460 pounds per lineal yard, endeavouring to tear
 the cloth asunder.        This power is easily provided against by a
 wide netting, although most cloths would sustain it without such
 additional strength.       Another circumstance to be adverted to,
 is the advantage that would arise from regulating the shape of
 the prow in the best manner for obviating the resistance of the
 air.   Theory unfortunately is of little use upon this occasion, for
 Nature, always true to itself, makes- the prow of the bird con
 cave, and that of the fish convex to their axes ; whereas theory
would appoint both alike.         In the absence of all good theory,
 I shall, as proposed in one of my former papers, give the form
 of the woodeock from actual measurement, that bird having
 frequently to cross at least 500 miles of sea at one flight, and
 Nature seeming to have united every contrivance to blend strength
with lightness in its structure ; — hence it is more than probable,
 that as the resistance of the air was the obstacle which all this
contrivance was calculated to overcome, the external form is
nearly the best possible, being that which would more than %li
the rest tend to the ease of the performance.
    Fig. I, Plate IV. shows a section of this bird through its axis.
Fig. 2, is a tranverse section with the apparatus suspended. The
ordinates are given in hundredth parts of an inch at the distance
of one inch from each other.         The weight of the individual bird
corresponding with these measures was 12 J ounces, and the ve
locity of its leisure flight in calm air will have been about 28 miles
per hour.      It may possibly require a different form of prow for
obviating resistance best at different velocities, and what may be
the best form for a small object may not be so, even at the same
velocity, for a large one; but notwithstanding this, I know no
better guide, and shall therefore recommend the experiment to
be made in the form of the prow delineated, as far as it can be
made to agree with the flattened structure necessary in this in
stance for the trial of the inclined plane.         That the practica
bility of constructing this balloon may be better judged of, I here
subjoin the following estimates respecting it.
      The quantity of cloth and the general appearance seem
enormous ; yet it must be recollected that it is only an inflated
bag, and that the 5750 square yards it consists of would all
pack up in a cubical. bore 3y yards each way, allowing I -5th of
an inch for the thickness of each fold, which must be amply
sufficient.    The cloth 1 made use of in my experiments generally
weighed half a pound per square yard-; but probably, including
the netting, the estimate for the present purpose should betaken
                                                                      at

                      On Aerial Navigation.                    325
 at a pound per yard; hence the weight would be 5750 pounds.
 Let the car, chimney, &c. be taken at 2000, and there would be
the power of 3050 left unoccupied, in addition to the power of 6,800
 pounds for effecting its progressive motion : however, it would
 be necessary for one hour's travelling to carry about 2000 pounds
'Weight of fuel, which would only leave power to convey a crew
 of seven men : hence it would be more suitable to carry about
 20 men, and to reduce the ascending velocity to 15 miles per
hour, allowing the descent to remain at the full speed, which
 would reduce the general speed to 17| miles per hour.
    This statement plainly shows that the Montgolfier balloon I
 have described is the least that would be efficient, which I trust
 will shield me from the imputation of holding extravagant opi
 nions upon this subject in proposing it.       Indeed the unwieldy
 bulk of these bodies is unwillingly thrust upon me by the result
 of calculations grounded upon the facts of the case.
     The danger attending the hydrogen gas balloon, where any
 first mover is used that acts by fire, is a great obstacle to their
 introduction ; otherwise a balloon of this kind equal in power
 to the one described, would not exceed 70 yards in length, and
 would meet with rather less than half the resistance, and of
 course not consume more than half the power to drive it at the
 proposed velocity — there are other inconvenienciea attending
 these balloons, and their cost hi filling is not one of the least.
 The great resistance upon the prow must be balanced either by
 a firm wanded texture, or by internal condensation ; the former
 is heavy and incapable of being folded up, and the latter waste
 ful, as it is impracticable to have it air-tight enough not to air
 low a vast escapage.      This would oblige a double structure, one
 of thin oiled silk containing the gas, and one of a coarser texture
 surrounding it,   which could receive the condensation necessary
 from common air driven in occasionally    by
                                           a      pump; or perhaps,
 with some little contrivance an aperture at the point of the
 prow, receiving the full direct resistance of the external air,
 commensurate with the velocity of the balloon, would answer this
 purpose.      The danger from fire might be greatly reduced      by
 having the balloon at considerable distance above the car, say
                       a
  20 yards, and the surface for wattage might be so arranged as
 to permit of   a   safe descent even in the event of the balloon
 Jaking fire, and being obliged to be cut away.
  It    was my intention to have ascertained what proportion of
 azote with hydrogen gas would render      it   incombustible on its
 access to common air but owing to an acciddent in the experi
                      ;
 ment immediately previous to my leaving home, this must be
 reserved toa    future opportunity ;^— perhaps the adulteration re
 quired may be so great as to render the specific gravity of the
                              X  3                           mixture

326                     On  Aerial Navigation.
mixture too nearly the same as atmospheric air to be of any use
in this instance; but if azote in the ratio of one half, or even
two to one, be ascertained to be sufficient, it will be an excellent
step gained towards realizing this invention.
    It is evident that if aerial navigation ever be brought home
to the uses of man (and who, noting the progressive stages of
societv, can set a limit to the powers which the benevolent Au
thor of his being designed him by proper gradations to become
possessed of?), it can only be done upon a scale of which the
balloon described is the first unit ; and although in the present
 day this unit is abundantly large enough in a practical point of
view to occupy all the attention that can be afforded to the sub
ject ; yet I shall nevertheless obtrude a little in prospect upon
the duties of our posterity respecting this art, as in a doing the
 capabilities that remain in store for our race will operate as an
 encouragement towards our availing ourselves of the first step.
 It has already been observed, that as balloons increase in size, the
 diminution of their relative resistance, when compared with their
power, keeps pace with that increase.        Upon this principle it is
 easy to show that a balloon of the form delineated, inflated with
hydrogen gas, when extended to the length of 144 yards, will
 meet with no more resistance when compared with the weight
 it will sustain, including its materials, than the resistance of the
 bird compared with its weight.         Surely we cannot wish for a
 better basis for swift aerial navigation, than that of a vessel ca
 pable of suspending in the air as many multiples of the weight
 of the bird, as its resistance contains multiples of the resistance
 of the bird at the same velocity.        This balloon would require
 1 1 880 square yards of cloth, which would fold within a cubic
 chest rather exceeding four yards each way, if of single struc
 ture; but I have taken it as a double structure, which would of
 course require two such spaces, and the weight at two pounds
per yard will be 24000 pounds.        I allow 17000 pounds for the
,other materials, including a surface of the necessary extent for
 waftage ; when, deducting these weights, the supporting power,
 which is 163,000 pounds, will be reduced to 122,000 pounds, or
 50 tons. This power remains to be divided in a proper ratio
 between the weight of the first mover and that of the cargo or
crew intended to be conveyed.           Although two-thirds of the
 weight of most birds is devoted to the muscles of its wings, and
 arguing from the rapid consumption of their food, that their
 muscles may be more energetic than those of quadrupeds, weight
for weight ; yet it is improbable that this excess is in any great
proportion. The famous race-horse Eclipse is said to have gone
for one mile at the rate of 60 miles per hour, which is a far
greater velocity than any bird whose flight I have measured ; and

he had the disadvantage          of carrying    the weight of a man upon
his back.        If therefore the energies of birds be taken at double
those of quadrupeds in this statement, more than an ample al
lowance is made in their favour.            This power in birds is chiefly
employed in the waftage necessary for their support, and a smaller
portion of it is applied to overcome the direct resistance of their
body: but in the case of the balloon the supporting power is al
ready obtained, and the whole energies of the first mover will
be directed towards overcoming the resistance of the prow only,
which is in no greater proportion to the weight of the whole
apparatus than that of the bird to its weight.
    Upon estimating the probable weight even of steam-engines
upon a large scale, it appears that 160 pounds per horse power
is an ample allowance with its load of coal and water for one
hour *j and as the water is a considerable part of the whole, and
can be recovered again for the use of the engine by permitting
the steam to pass within the double coats of the balloon, and to
                                                                                 '
be thus exposed to so extensive a cooling surface, it is probable
that 200 pounds per horse power will be more than sufficient
for working twelve hours without any further supply of water or
fuel — with a velocity of 20 miles per hour in calm air, this
length of time would imply a stage of 240 miles.                  The steam-
horse power raising 550 pounds one foot high per second, is
considered by engineers as exceeding the average power of the
largest dray-horses one-fourth. Upon weighing one of these
animals of about the middle size, I found it to be fourteen hundred
weight or 1568 pounds; and I am informed some of the largest
of these horses have weighed a ton. — But if we take the smaller
weight as approaching the average, we must increase it one-
fourth part to make an animal equal in power to the steam-
horse : hence the <veight of the steam-horse will be as 200
pounds to 1950 pounds when compared to that of the living
animal.       And to follow the argument I have been using, if the

 weight of the steam-horse be deducted, there will remain 1750
 pounds, which will, according to these estimates, be the weight
 of inert cargo in terms of horse powers which would be conveyed
'by this means. This is not a correct mode of estimating the
 matter in question ; but I wish to show, by entering into this com
 parison of animal and engine power, how very much the latter
 exceeds the former in energy, weight for weight ; and that even
 if the estimates should be so false as to be five-fold wrong, yet
 there would be sufficient power for the purpose.     I shall deduct
 three times the weight of the engine estimated in the note from
 the 50 tons of power unoccupied in the balloon, when there will
 remain rather more than 34 tons of power for any purpose re
 quired.    This would convey 500 men during one hour, 410 men
 during 12 hours, 290 men for 24 hours, and 50 men for 48
 hours, without fresh supplies of fuel or water.      The extent of
 the voyage in calm air would in the latter case be 960 miles.
     I do not offer this statement with any expectation of its being
 realized in our age; but I do affirm that balloon navigation does
 hold out the capabilities I have so daringly ventured to investi
 gate; and I trust that others will join Mr. Edgeworth and my
 self in promoting experiments upon a subject that promises
 eventually such advantage' to mankind ; the progress of civili
 zation being evidently commensurate with the facility of com
 munication.       The expense of constructing the Montgolfier
 balloon described in my former paper, if taken at three shillings
 per yard including the machinery, would be 870 pounds, and
 probably 1000 or 1500 pounds would defray the expenses of the
 experiment.      The double cloth of the hydrogen gas balloon at
 six shillings would cost 3600 pounds, and the engines, &c. say
 from 6 to 7000 pounds ; so that this immense fabric, when com
 pared to the large ships it seems to outvie, is not a tenth part
 of their cost. Their expense, however, when compared with
 their freight, will be about 300/. per'ton. The formation of
 hydrogen gas by the usual process is slow and expensive ; but by
 keeping fresh supplies of iron borings red hot within an exten
 sive cavity properly constructed, and passing steam through the
 hydrogen gas, may be supplied at a very cheap rate, and with
 considerable rapidity.
     The vast strides which science of every kind has made within
 the last twenty years renders every advancing step more easy ;
 and it appears to me that England may soon have the honour
 of perfecting the construction of balloons, although the inven
  tion of them was not altogether her own.      The heavy expense,
 however, of such extensive experiments renders it necessary that
 it should become a national object ; and as the means of di
 recting balloons are within the scope of information of almost

 that can be acquired in this pursuit, will be given to those who
 do actually realize the invention, and this will be due to each in
 dividual in proportion to the liberality with which he supports
 the undertaking.
     Large individual subscriptions however are not necessary to
 obtain 1500/. and in fact subscriptions of one guinea are often
 more productive than those of a hundred. But whatever gentle
 men may think proper to subscribe, whilst the subject is before
 them, I would request them to give notice of immediately, as 'by

     From Mr. London's statement at a meeting of the committee,
 it appears that the brine ought always to contain a redundancy
 of salt; in such case there is not the least danger of the fish
 putrefying or growing rancid, as the extra lumps of solid salt in
 the brine immediately act upon any watery or other liquors
 which proceed from the fish when inclosed in the cask.         That
 the same process will also answer perfectly well for preserving
 beef or any animal food for sea store.

    This instrument consists of  a glass bottle, with a ground-glass
stopper, to be filled with brine made from a solution of solid salt
 in water ; within it are three glass bubbles, a, b, c, of different
specific gravities, so graduated that, supposing the temperature
of the air to be at sixty degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer,
and only one bubble floats on the surface, as shown in the en
graving at a,- it indicates the specific gravity of the brine to be
 1,155, containing about 20 parts salt, and 80 of water, which is
insufficient to cure animal matters with certainty by immersion
in it.
    When the second bubble, c, floats, it indicates the specific
gravity of the brine to be 1,180, or about 24 parts salt, and 76
parts water, which may be used for the purpose of immersion.
    But when the three bubbles, a, b, c, float, they indicate the
specific gravity to be 1,106, or about 28 salt, and 72 water.
    This brine will fully answer the purpose in the hottest weather
in most climates, provided the rules be attended to which I had
the honour to send to the Society last year, and the meat or
fish always completely covered with the brine.

 LXVI.      On the Stale   of the Manufacture of Sugar in France.
                     By M. le Comte Chaptal*.
  J. he last five-and-twenty years will form a memorable epocha
 in the annals of French industry.           Most of the extraordinary
 events that have succeeded each other have concurred to fa
 vour its progress.     France, deprived of her colonies, blockaded
 at all her frontiers, found herself reduced to rely on her own in
 ternal strength ; and by raising a contribution of the knowledge
 of her inhabitants, anil of the productions of her soil, she has
 been enabled to satisfy all her wants, to create arts which be
 fore had no existence, to improve those that were known, and
 to render herself independent of foreign countries for the greatest
 part of the articles of her consumption.          Thus we have succes
 sively  seen  improved  the  arts  of refining  saltpetre, the manufac
 ture of arms and of powder, of tanning leather, of spinning cot
 ton, wool, and flax, of weaving generallv, and the execution of
 several other arts to which we were strangers ; such as the de
 composition of sea-salt for the extraction of soda ; the forma
 tion of alum and copperas ; the fixing upon woven goods several
 colours which had been previously considered as fugitive ; the
 substitution of the sugar of beet-root for that of the sugar cane ;
 of woad in the place of the indigo plant, and of madder for the
.scarlet of cochineal.      We might say, indeed, that the learned
 had diverted their attention from dwelling on public calamity,
 by fixing it on the means of consoling the people and lightening
 the burthen of their misfortunes.
     Although these discoveries and many others are now become
 regular manufactures, it is to be feared that some of them will
 fall again into oblivion, either in consequence of the facility with
 which we can resort to the former sources, or from the habit
 and prejudice which recommends in the eyes of the consumer
 those commodities that have been a long time in use, or even
 by erroneous measures of administration ; I therefore think it
 an important object that all these processes be carefully de
 scribed, in order that they may be transmitted to posterity.         It
 will at least prove to them what science is capable of accom
 plishing for the prosperity of a nation at a critical period, and
 they may extract from it this consolatory truth, that France has
 the means within herself of satisfying almost all her wants.
     I shall confine myself now to show how France has been en
 abled to supply the place of the sugar of the new world by the
 products of her own soil ; and if the Institute approve this work,
 I shall have the honour of submitting to it successively all the

 new processes of manufacture that can be interesting to industry,
  to commerce, and the nation.
     We recollect with terror those difficult tines when the French,
  driven from the seas, had no communication either with their
 own colonies or those of other nations.             France found herself all
  at once deprived of all the products of Asia and America, of
 which the greatest part had become articles of the first necessity.
 She called upon the industry of her own people ; the government
 encouraged their efforts, and in a little time we obtained substi
  tutes for some by indigenous products, and we found in the pro
 ductions of our soil, substances absolutely of the same nature as
  those for which we had hitherto been dependent on the new
 world. The cottons of Spain, of Rome, and Naples, especially
 those of Castellamare, are employed in the place of those of
 America and India ; madder takes the place of cochineal by the
 process of Messrs. Gouin ; woad, as it is treated in the establish
 ments of Messrs. Puymaurin, Roiuju^s, and Giobert, furnishes
 excellent indigo ; and the numerous manufactories formed for
 the extraction of sugar from beet-root, show to Europe that wc
 have shaken off the yoke of the new world.
     Hardly were these establishments formed, scarcely were the
 still imperfect processes established, than another order of things
 took place: peace has again opened the communication, our old
 habits have resumed their empire, and in a little time probablv
 wc shall have banished to the rank of chintseras, the possibility
 of manufacturing sugar and indigo among ourselves. However,
 some persons have continued,               and still continue, to extract
sugar     from   beet-root;  and   it  is   easy to prove that this manu
facture may be supported        in   competition with that of the colo
nies, which I believe I shall demonstrate in this memoir.
    When France began to experience the want of sugar, we at
first sought for the means of supplying it in the syrups of certain
fruits, especially the grape, and this manufacture has been sin
gularly improved.        Large establishments were formed in several
parts of    the  kingdom for the extraction of syrup, and' they have
been productive of two important results, equally advantageous ;
first, of causing the consumption of a great quantity of syrup in
the place of sugar for several domestic purposes, and exclusively
in the hospitals; secondly, of giving a value to our grapes which
at that period had scarcely any.            A little time afterwards a me
thod    was   found of extracting     a   farinaceous and solid sugar from
the grape, and this product was more similar to the cane sugar
than the syrup ; it was like the cane sugar in having no smell,
and could be employed instead of it in every way, by using two
or three times its weight to produce the same effect.                   This
sugar    is not  susceptible of crystallization.        Nearly  at the same

                         of Sugar   in France.                     333
time, chemistry furnished the means of decolorating honey and
depriving it of smell, so that it could be employed in the infu
sions of tea and coffee as well as the best syrup of sugar.
   AU these processes were become domestic operations, and
very little privation was suffered from the scarcity of cane sugar;
but it was reserved for chemistry to produce in our climate the
actual sugar of the colonies, and this was not long in coming to
pass.    Already the analyses of Margraaf and the important la
bours of Achard had put us in the way ; all now to be done was
to improve the processes, and form a sufficient number of esta
blishments to supply the demand. To effect this, the encourage
ment was prodigious, and in a single year we saw more than a
hundred and fifty manufactories arise, some of which have pro
ceeded with great success, and have poured into the market se
veral millions, of excellent sugar.    The failure of a great number
of these establishments may doubtless be traced to causes that
must necessarily accrue on the introduction of any new species
of industry, either to an error in the choice of situation, or to
the great expense incurred in setting up the apparatus, or in
short to the deficiency of proper information on the subject.
    In the midst of a vast wreck of establishments, some are
found which have continued to work prosperously for four years.
 In these we may reasonably expect to find lessons of practical
knowledge and economical management, as well as the best
methods of cultivating the beet-root, and of extracting sugar
from it ; and as my own establishment is of this number, I shall
limit myself to the testimony of my own experience.
         On the Culture and Preservation       of the Beet- root.
    It should be sown towards the end of March or in April, when
there is no longer any fear of frost.
    It is of different colours, white, red, yellow, or mottled,
and -sometimes the pellicle is red and the inside white.           It is
now known bv all agriculturists, and especially by those of Ger
many, that the same colour is not always reproduced ; as for
example, in a field that has been sown with seed proceeding
from the yellow beet, the produce has proved more or less white
or red, and this I have had occasion to remark myself.
    In Germany they prefer the white beet-root, in France the
yellow; but in consequence of many comparative experiments I
am of opinion that they give too much importance to the co
lour. I have not observed that the different colours produce
anv perceptible variation in the results, when the root proceeds
from the same soil and the same culture.
   The most proper soil for the cultivation of the beet-root is
that which is both light and rich, and of a- good depth.          Poor,
                                                                   dry,

334               On the Stale of the Manufacture
dry, and sandy soils are not at all suitable, for the beet comes
up in such ground quite small and dry :- the juice it affords marks
eleven degrees by the areometer of Baume, but is by no means
plentiful. It has happened to me not to be able to extract from
it more than 32 per cent. The juice is very much charged with
sugar ; but the proportion does not indemnity the manufacturer.
    Neither is stiff argillaceous soil proper for it. The seed comes
up badly, especially if soon after it is sown a heavy rain happen
to fall, which heaps up the earth and prevents the access of air:
in which case the seed rots without germinating. I lost in 1813
ten hectares (equal to twenty French acres) of beet-root by this
accident.     It is even seldom that in stiff soil the beet acquires
much size; it is thrust above the surface only because there is
no longer room for it below.             Meadows newly ploughed and
 alluvial earths manured, and for a long time used, are very pro
per for the culture of this root.        A good ground will furnish a
hundred thousand of beet per          hectare ; 1 have even gathered as
many as a hundred and twenty from a meadow newly ploughed;
but the mean product is from forty to fifty thousand.
    The ground intended to receive beet should be prepared bv
 two or three very deep ploughings.           Three years ago I sowed
 some in ground that was intended to receive corn in the autumn;
 I prepared it by two good ploughings and a suitable manuring;
 I sowed towards the end of March, and gathered in the be
 ginning of October.        I left the leaves upon the ground, sowed
the com, and covered it in the ordinary way; in this manner mv
harvest of beet-root was an intermediate harvest, which did not
 deprive the estate of a grain of corn.
     Three years experience has convinced me that the crop of
 corn was equally good upon this ground, as upon that which had
 lain fallow during summer ; and further, that the thinning,
 weeding, and gathering of the beet-root had cleared the soil of
 all weeds, and that these corn-fields were less infested with them
 than any other.       It was for some time believed that ground
 newly   manured    produced beet- root less rich in sugar; and it
 has  even been added, that when put into ground manured by
 sheep the'root produces only saltpetre.         I can safely affirm that
these assertions are erroneous, and that the production of salt
 petre is owing to another cause, which I' shall demonstrate in
 the sequel.
    Four different methods have been successively adopted for
 sowing the seed of the beet; but I prefer that by broad-cast, like
 corn, and covering it over afterwards by the harrow.           This me
 thod, which is the most simple of any, is the most advantageous,
 although it requires a much greater quantity of seed than the
 others : it takes about three kilogrammes per. acre, instead of
                                                                      one

                           of Sugar in France.                      335
one and a half ; but this difference is hardly to be considered,
since the price of the seed is reduced to a reasonable rate. Be
sides, the advantages of this method are considerable:          1st, by
employing this quantity of seed we are assured that all the soil
will be covered ; 2dly, as soon as the plant is well up, it is
weeded and thinned of all the useless roots, and only those re
tained that are vigorous, so that a good harvest is always cer
tain, whatever weather it may have endured.
     On  the Care that Beet-root requires durmg its Vegetation.
    Perhaps there is no plant that suffers more from the vicinity
of others than the beet-root ; it remains small and without vi
gour, if the ground be not carefully cleared of all the plants that
spring up beside it.
    The weeding should be renewed as often as the ground             be
comes covered with weeds : hut in general two operations             are
sufficient.     It is an expense and    trouble well bestowed, for the
 produce of an acre well weeded is at least double what it would
 be if neglected.
     In general the beet is gathered in the beginning of October,
and the operation is terminated towards the fifteenth.        The time
 of gathering is not a matter of indifference ; but every one knows
 that in the course of vegetation there is formed a succession of
 different products which replace each other ; so that the cry-
 stallizable sugar is contained in the beet- root only at a certain
 period of its vegetation, and that this period is the time that
 must be chosen to gather it.
     In support of this opinion I can state a fact established by
 M. Daracq, whose talents and good sense are well known, and
 who formed about three years ago, in conceit with the prefect
 of the department des Landes, M. le Comte D'Angos, the pro
ject of establishing sugar- works from beet-root.
     From the month of Julv until towards the end of August he
 made a trial of the beet every eight days, and lie constantly ex
 tracted three and a half per cent, of fine sugar: from these spe
 cimens he believed himself certain of success, and from that
  time bestowed all his care on the formation of his establish
  ment, and discontinued his weekly trials ; but he was greatly
  surprised, when towards the end of October he resumed his ope
  rations on the beet, to find it no longer possible to extract an
  atom of crystallized sugar from it.        It appears, that when the
  beet  has  terminated    its saccharine  vegetation, if I may so ex
  press myself, it forms nitrate of potash, at the expense of the
  constituent principles of the sugar: and this formation takes
  place in the ground, when it is assisted by the heat, just the
  same as it does in the store- houses.
                                                                       In

336                 On the Slate of the Manufacture
    In March 1813      I wished to use some beet which I had stored
in   a cellar,   and obtained from it only nitrate of potash, al
though it was neither decayed nor had germinated ; this beet
yielded.less juice by one-third, than that which had been kejit
in the open air, or in magazines well aired.
    It is not uncommon for puffs of nitrous gas to come out oS
the abundant skim which forms when the juice of fhe beet is
poured into a boiler ; the production of this gas discovers the
commencement of a change in the beet, although in this state
sugar may still be extracted from it : I have several times ob
served this phenomenon, and always in the circumstances above
mentioned.        By the progress of the alteration this nitrous gas
passes to the state of nitric acid, this acid unites with tire pot
ash and forms nitrates, and then the decomposition of the cry-
stallizable sugar is completed.
    We must not be surprised then if in the whole of the south,
from Bordeaux to Lyons, it is found that beet which has re
mained in the ground until the end of October, will afford only
nitrate of potash, and not an atom of crystallizable sugar.        As
the beet-roots are pulled up, the leaves should be stripped off
and left on the ground for manure, when there is not enough of
them for the consumption of cattle.
    Beet is as soon injured by frost as by heat: it is frozen at a
temperature of one degree below zero of Reaumur ; and begins
to germinate and change at a- temperature of eight or nine de
 grees above it.
     In order to keep beet in a proper state it should be stored in
 a dry place, of a temperature a few degrees above zero of the
thermometer.         A barn or granary are very proper places for a
 magazine of this nature ; but it is seldom that the whole quan
 tity can be lodged in one building ; for want of a covered place
 sufficiently spacious it must often be left in the open air, and
 when this is the case a dry piece of ground must be selected,
 which is not subject to be overflowed; on this ground a bed of
stones should be laid, and on the stones a layer of straw ; in
 the middle should be raised a stake, and bundles of straw placed
 round it that reach to the top ; round this the beet should be
 heaped, till it forms a square of seven or eight feet by five or six
 in height.     The stake is afterwards to be taken away, so that the
 space   which    it occupied may form a sort of chimney to give
 egress  to  the  vapours that escape from the beet.    The sides and
 the top   must   then be covered with  a bed of straw, the top being
 made to incline, that the rain may not fall in or remain upon it ;
 and the whole should be confined by bands that the wind may
 not have power to disturb the straw.        Some cultivators, espe
 cially in the north, preserve their beet by heaping it in the fields,
                                                             covering

covering it with earth and enveloping the whole hy a bed of heath
 or broom, so that water cannot penetrate.
    But whatever method may be adopted in storing beet, there
 are some general precautions to be attended to which are indis
 pensable in all eases.    In the first place, it must not be stored
 up when wet; and if the weather will permit, it is ven desirable
 that it should be left for a few days in the fields to dry. Se
 condly, it must not be covered up until frost is expected, and
 must be uncovered, and left so as long as the temperature is a
few degrees above freezing, provided it does not rain.      Thirdly,
it should be often examined; and if it appears to become heated,
or decayed, or germinates, the heap must be opened, the in
jured roots separated from                it,
                                    and then      must be made up     it
again.
             On the Extraction                of   Sugar from Beet-roof.
   The extraction of sugar from this plant has given rise to                                       a
course of operations which shall successively describe.
                                     I                  During
four years that    has been prastised in France, many different
                   it
processes have been employed, and great modifications               have
been adopted in each of the operations.             have examined and I
compared them all, but shall confine myself to the description
of that which has constantly afforded the best results.

these graters consist of cylinders furnished on the surface with
indented plates ; these cylinders may be moved so rapidly,- by
means of wheels, that they will make 400 revolutions in a mi
nute, and will tear and reduce the beet to a pulp in an instant.
Two of these graters, put in motion by the same machinery, and
attended by three women and two children, are sufficient to
grate daily 10,000 weight of beet, by working only four hours
 a-day, two hours at a time; it is very rare that half an hour
 more is necessary.
     Immediately as the operation of grating is terminated, the
 persons employed begin to cleanse the graters, to wash them,
 and then to place round them the 5000 weight of beet vthat are to
 be grated at the second operation.
     In order that the pulp may be of a good quality, it must have
 the appearance of a soft paste, without any lumps; for the press,
 however powerful, can extract but a very small proportion of
 juice from fragments of beet that have not been torn.         When it
 is only crushed between mill-stones, in the manner that is prac
 ticed for making cider and perry, the juice obtained from the
 press is not more than 30 or 40 per cent., whereas when it is
 torn by the graters, from 65 to 75 per cent. is extracted. 2dly,
 As fast as the pulp is formed it is submitted to pressure, in or
 der to extract the juice.       I begin by putting it into small lever
 presses at first, and afterwards removing it toothers more power
 ful, so as to extract from 65 to 75 per cent. of juice. The
 operation is perfect when the mure or dregs are so dry that on
 squeezing it hard with the hands it does not wet them.         To di
 minish the expense of manual labour, I place the graters and
 presses on a stage, in such a manner that the juice falls of itself,
 through leaden canals, into the boilers, which are placed on the
 ground.      It is" necessary that the pulp should be expressed as
 fast as it forms, or else it blackens, and a degree of fermentation
 commences, which renders the extraction of the sugar more dif
 ficult. The juice marks from five to eleven degrees, and com
 monly from seven to eight by Baume's areometer.
     Four men are sufficient to work the presses, in operating upon
  ten thousand weight of beet per day.
     I have before mentioned, that the juices run immediately out
 of the presses into a boiler, which I call a depuralor, in relation
  to its use.    Supposing two operations to be effected in a day,
  and that 5000 weight of beet-dot is operated upon each time,
  this boiler, which is round, should be five feet and a half wide,
  and three feet eight inches deep ; of these dimensions it will
  contain the whole product of one operation.            As soon as the
  boiler is one-third or half full, the ftre is lighted.   By the time

have acquired from forty to fifty degrees of heat, which is suf
fered to increase to sixty-five or sixty-six degrees, and the mo
ment it has attained this heat the fire is smothered by covering .
it with wet coals. Lime, slaked with warm water, is then thrown
into the boiler, in the proportion of two grammes and a half
(about forty-eight grains) to a litre of juice, being careful to
vary the proportion according to the consistence of the juice.
Theiiquid mass must be well stirred, in all directions, for some
minutes, and then the fire is revived, in order to raise the heat

                                     To    Mr. Tilloc1i.
Sir, — Having in my former communication shown that the
term day, as used in designating the six periods of the Genesis,
properly denotes one revolution, whether slow or rapid, of the
earth upon its axis, which produced       morning and an everting
                                                         a
successively upon every meridian on the globe, my object in the
present paper     to rectify some misconceptions of your corre
                   is
spondents, respecting certain parts of the Cosmogony connected
with those periods.
   The statement of facts enumerated         Dr. Prichard, p. 2S7
                                                             by
of your last volume,       conceive just, with the exception of the
                               is
three articles where he says " the water had subsided before the
                                I
creation of organized beings."     But this perhaps    one of those     is
verbal inaccuracies which he hints at in your last number.    Your
correspondent F.     — — has committed the same mistake at
                           E   .     s
p. 181 of the present volume, in which he remarks, that "the
waters retire previous to the existence of animated beings, and
never again cover. the earth until the days of Noah."       On this
error he founds   plausible objection against
                       a                       the Cosmogony, and
                                           Y    2       endeavours

340               "On Ihe Cosmogony    of Moses.
endeavours to support it by a reference to geological phaenomena.
The only passage in the Genesis, from which any such inference
could be drawn, is the following, ver. 9, " Let the waters be ga
thered together to one place, and let the drv land appear." This
construction seems somewhat to favour the error.       The Hebrew,
however, is in the future tense, and literally, '*' the waters shall
tend to one place, and the dry land shall appear ; and it was
so." Moses uses the same original word, Gen. chap. viii. ver. 5,
to describe the first appearance of the mountains at the deluge:
"  The waters decreased continually until the tenth month : in
the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the (ops
of the mountains seen."      But the waters of the deluge ' were not
abated from off the earth' for some months afterwards.         Now it-
is no more possible that the earth could have been instantaneously
laid dry, when the mountains emerged out of the primitive ocean,
than when they showed themselves above the waters of the
deluge.    The formation therefore of the dry-land at the creation
was gradual, and the subsidence of the waters in proportion to
the means employed to drain them off.        The manner in which
this was effected does not at present concern us.       It is evident,
then, that the waters only began to subside, when the dry-land
appeared.     How long it was before they sunk to a fixed level
never can be ascertained.     Ages might have elapsed, even after
 the land animals were created, before the waters had completely
.subsided.    Hence, to say nothing of the probable rapidity of the
depositions, since the period between the elevation of the land
to the complete subsidence of the waters is indefinite, I feel con
fident in the assertion, that it was sufficient for the formation of
all the strata at lower and lower levels, from the clay-slate down
to the chalk rocks, which are supposed to be among the last de
posits of the primitive ocean ; and, as the retreat of the water*
was from the equatorial parts towards the polar regions, these
calcareous rocks are accordingly found only in the higher lati
 tudes.
   It has been generally, but erroneously supposed that each ope
ration was completed within the period in which it is first men
tioned ; and that the day was solely occupied by that particular
object ; whereas the subject is sometimes noticed, because it
then began to be formed ; at other times it is specified, because
it then proved actually fit for the purpose for which it was de
signed.    Thus the other is pronounced ' good* on the first day,
because, as soon as it reached the earth the globe was put in
motion by it.    The expanse or atmosphere began to be formed,
but was not completed on the second dav; nothing but the
other is declared ' good' or fit until the third day, in which the
dry-land appeared and vegetables began to be produced ; nor is

                   On the Cosmogony    of Moses.                 34   1
 the sun itself pronounced fit for its office until the end of the
 fourth day.
    In order to correct certain rn is takes, and obviate some ob
jections to the Cosmogony, I shall, for the sake of brevity, enu
merate, as Dr. Prichard has done, the facts in the Genesis, and,
without drawing a parallel between them and the geological
 phenomena,     shall only insert such observations as may be ne
cessary   for my purpose.
    1. All the substances of which the earth is composed were
once in a state of atomic division.        The waters of the ocean
universally covered for a long period the- whole mass, and by
chemical action formed what are called primitive rocks.        But it
is impossible from any present process of crystallization, to judge
of the rapidity with which the original atoms were crystallized,
and strata formed by their aggregation,
    2. No organic beings existed in the primitive ocean till after
the mountains were elevated.
    3. The mountains emerged out of the ocean at the commence
ment of the third period.      The waters then began to subside,
but still continued to form strata, and in proportion as they left
the land dry, vegetables were produced.
    The production of zoophytes and testacea is justly referred
by Dr. Prichard to this epoch ; because they are destitute of
locomotive powers, which Moses positively assigns to all the
productions of the fifth period.   The objections which F. E-i      s
has raised to this statement, when his collateral matter is re
moved, amounts to this — " Moses, it is true, e - pressly says that
all the aquatic locomotive animals were produced in the fifth
period, but he does not specifically determine in what period
zoophues and testacea were produced; therefore the parallel
fails between the facts detailed in the Genesis and those inferred
from geological phenomena."         But surely this is such a test as
no author can endure; at most, it can injustice only be applied
to those professedly systematic.     Has Moses, in relating the pe
riods of creation and order of things in the formation of this
earth and its inhabitants, indeed given a false representation of
nature, because he has omitted to mention one or two particular
species of animated beings ?      Does he not at the conclusion of
the narrative say, " Thus were the heavens and the earth finished,
and all the host of them."      This mode of expression is equiva
lent to that in the fourth commandment, " In six days the Lord
made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them."        Now
it is highly unreasonable, to say the best of   it, when an author
gives the iimits of his premises, to deny that he means to in--
 chide all the intermediate terms.     What should we think of the
                                Y 3                          person

342                On the Cosmogony    of Moses*
person that could question, whether another had travelled everv
inch of the road from London to Edinburgh, through York and
Newcastle, merely because he had not named every other inter -
venient stage ?    Must the Cosmogony then be exploded, because
the author has not marked every link in the chain of organiza
tion? — because he has neither pointed out the precise limit be
tween animal and vegetative life, nor distinguished the formation
of aquatic plants from those belonging to the land, nor named
the species which conjoins the locomotive animals of the fifth
with those of the sixth day?     Should we, it seems according to
the reasoning of your correspondent F. E          s, assign the bat
species to the fifth day, " we place an order of locomotive beings
where Moses has not placed them."        But though " it is abso
lutely certain that Moses assigns them" to neither of these pe
riods, he, as certainly, never designed to exclude from the Cos
mogony either the bat species, which connects the locomotive
animals of the fifth with those of the sixth day, or zoophytes
and testacea, which link the organized productions of the fifth
with those of the third day. Having described the order in
which the grand classes of organized beings were produced, he
leaves us to systematize, and make our own physiological di
stinctions.   So imperceptible is the gradation of species among
organized beings, that it is only within these few years natu
ralists have thought "proper to transfer corals, &c. from the rank
of vegetables, among which they were classified as fungitce, and
arrange them as animals under the technical name of zoophytes.
Even testacea do not lose all analogy to vegetables, though they
rank higher in the scale of existence than zoophytes, and, agree
ably to the tenor of the narrative, were probably created some
what later.     Testacea approach very near to vegetative life;
their stationary disposition, and their receiving nutriment by
suction, most likely from the same substances with aquatic plants,
give them no small resemblance to vegetables.        In short, they
seem a kind of animated fungi, compared with the locomotive
animals that subsist around them.
    Whatever coincidence may be discovered between the above
reasoning and that of Dr. Prichaid, in his answer to F. E         s,
is entirely accidental ; for the whole paragraph was written be
fore I received your last number.      But 1 ought rather to have
said that our agreement necessarily arises from an impartial
view of the question.
   4. The waters continuing to decrease, the vegetable kingdom
became more and more extended, till the conclusion of the fourth
day, when the sun by its regular operation produced a corre
sponding regularity in the motions of the earth, which was now
                                                           rendered

                      On the Cosmogony      of Moses.               343
rendered fit for the reception of beings of a more perfect cha
racter than vegetables, or those motionless concretions of ani
mated matter, zoophytes and testacea.
     5. In tiie fifth period aquatic locomotive animals were pro
duced, the waters being now sufficiently purified for their re
ception.      Dr. Prichard has well observed, that locomotion is the
precise meaning of the Hebrew word used to distinguish this
class of organized beings.       It is not a little remarkable that to
this period Moses assigns the production of birds.         Though they
are by internal organization constituted for living in air, their
locomotive powers certainly have a nearer relation to those of
fishes thmi to the powers of locomotion in land animals.            An
other reason, besides the perishable nature of their bones, may
be assigned for their remains being so rarely found ; viz. they
tire better provided with the means of escape from sudden inun
dations than land animals, or even fishes, in certain situations.
     Moses notices a class of aquatic animals, in the productions of
this period, which our translators have rendered ' great whales :'
but literally the phrase ought to be 'great monsters;' which will
 include not only existing crocodiles, hippopotami, Sec. but also
those large marine animals found in different parts of this country
as well as* upon the continent,       embedded in the lyas or argil
 laceous limestone, and, until very lately, erroneously supposed
 to be crocodiles.
     b". The various species of land reptiles and quadrupeds       were
 produced early     on the sixth  day.
     7. Every thing being thus prepared for their reception the
rational species is lastly formed ; and the whole osconomy of
  nature being pronounced ' very good,' man is invested by the
 Creator with dominion over all the inferior creatures.
     It is with reluctance that I remark upon what Dr. Prichard
 has advanced, p. 259 of your last number.          In defending Moses
 as an inspired writer, he    says  that the Egyptians were possessed
 of "the most authentic documents that existed concerning the
  history of the world."     An opinion which he assumes on the
  authority   of Michaelis,  who embraces the hypothesis of Mar-
                                   "
 sham in his Rule of Times, — thatMoses framed his code oflaws
 by combining the ancient usages of the nomadic Hebrews with
 the institutions of the agricultural Egyptians."        Now, however
 well calculated the hypothesis may be for displaying the learning
 of the German professor, his erudition is of no weight, when
 put in the scale against the plain and positive language of Scrip
  ture ; Lev. chap, xviii. ver. 3-4.       "After the doings of the
  land of Egypt wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do : neither shall ye
 walk in their ordinances.      Ye shall do my judgements, and keep
 mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am' -Jehovah your God."

 344         Description  of the Thunder-storm Alarum.
 Whatever use Moses might make of the Egyptian documents in
 composing his Cosmogony, he certainly had a purer source from
 whence to draw his information.       The Hebrews and their an
 cestors were worshippers of the true God; therefore the history
 of the origin of the world is more likely to have been preserved
 pure by them than among the idolatrous Egyptians.          Supersti
 tion never was favourable to truth.      Traditional facts are also
 more safe with a nomadic than a civic people.      They have fewer
 subjects to burthen the memory, and less temptation to corrupt
 them.
    The perseverance of Dr. Prichard in his original intention of
 proving the Mosaic Cosmogony " capable of a rational and phi
losophical interpretation" is laudable ; and the near approaches
 he has made to this, particularly in p. 262, 263 of your last num
 ber, are important results from the repeated attacks of his op
ponent.     But having assumed an untenable position respecting
the term day, lie is forced, p. 260, to advance some unwarrantable
opinions in order to support it.      The supposition that the He
brews were anthropomorphites        must rest upon evidence from
their writings.    Now if we are to determine the national belief
from their religious institutes and theology of their other scrip
tures, they were, as a nation, the furthest of aH others from an
thropomorphism.       All other nations were idolaters, and, in ge
neral, conceived the most perfect image of the Deity must be
the likeness of man.       The Hebrew writers are unequalled in
speaking of the spirituality of God ; and where they speak of the
eyes, arms, &c. of Jehovah, these expressions, in the connexion
in which they stand, no more favour anthropomorphism than
the term father itself, as applied to the Author of life. With
respect to the expression       " God rested;" it would be more
agreeable to the spirit of the original, to render it ceased; —
" God ceased from all his work, which he created, rwttf> to
operate," as ver. 3, chap. ii. of the Genesis, ought to be ren
dered.

                          To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —    I herewith     hand you a description and figure of an
electrical instrument, which may I think with propriety be called
                                                                The

The Thunder-storm Alarum ;                    as   it   serves to show the effect      which
is produced by the passage of                 a charged cloud over an atmospke-                   \
rical electrometer.
    This instrument consists of a mahogany box about 6f inches
in height, and about 3 inches in width, also 3 inches in depth.
The fron (when not in use) is closed with a sliding piece of
mahogany, like a sliding box lid.            A glass tube A (Plate III,
fig. 2,) is fixed at the top of the box, projecting some way into
it ; and through this a brass wire B passes, on the upper part
of which is a brass ball C ; and at the lower, a piece of brass D
is screwed.      A fine piece of flexible wire E (such as is wound
round cat-gut musical strings) is inserted into the ball C ; a
small bell F, on       brass pillar C,
                        fla                    fixed at the bottom of the

                    a  H.    The   inside   as   well as  the outside    of the
glass   tube  should  be   coated   with    melted    sealing-wax     or  other
insulating substance.
    There      no necessity for using an electrical machine, in order

which passes through the glass tube the clapper, which   ;                 sus.-       is
pended         by
               the silken string, will then vibrate and strike the
bell for some time, whilst the paper remains near the upper wire
of the apparatus.        The excited paper aptly represents an arti
ficial charged thunder cloud.
  A    piece of woollen stuff (such as          made use of for gowns),

                     Prichard.         By F. E         s.
                               To   Mr. Tillock.
Sir, —     In   your last number Dr. Prichard candidly acknow
ledges an immaterial          inadvertence, attempts to reconcile his
contradictory statements, and makes some show of maintaining
his former positions; but finally, under pretence of generously
extricating his opponent from an imaginary difficulty, retreats
by the dubious light of Geddes's* critical torch, to a new cha
teau en Espagne.          As he intimates that this castle will be re
spected by
                " unprejudiced persons," I of course do not mean
to   " attack" it. On the other parts of his communication I shall
presume to offer a few obvious remarks.
    It is incidentally shown in my last paper, that his statements
at different times do not always accord with each other.                   To
this something in the way of reply has been said: not however
perceiving how it invalidates my stricture, I shall leave it un
touched, and content myself with pointing out more distinctly
than before the contradictory passages. After noticing in his first
 letter the alleged extraordinary coincidence between the series
of facts announced in the six days creation, and those inferred
from geological phaenomena, he remarks, that " if this coinci
dence is surprising in itself, it appears the more so when we
compare the Cosmogony of the Hebrews with the notions on
this subject that prevailed among other nations of antiquity."
"   We find," says he, " invariably that all other speculations on
this subject are founded on some fanciful analogy with natural
processes that are daily observed f."             Could the most deter
mined adversary urge any thing more in direct contradiction to
 this than what is contained in his succeeding letter?            It is there
 either affirmed or shown that " scarcely any thing is contained
in the antediluvian history of Moses which may not also be found,
 though more or less embellished, in the records of other nations,
 particularly in those of the Hindoos" — " that the Institutes of
 Menu begin with an account of the creation which bears a strong
 resemblance to that of Moses, though embellished or deformed
 with many wild conceits        J" — and that, according to the informa
 tion preserved in Suidas, the Etruscan Cosmogony bore a yet
 more striking analogy with that of the Hebrews §.
    This notice of the Etruscan Cosmogony will, I hope, atone
         * Whiston as a nuidc would have served
                                                    equally well.

                                                             am                 I
unconscious of having given any opmion respecting this ana
logy, though      indicated the legitimate consequence of sup
                  I
posing the Mosaic account not an immediate revelation to Moses,
but  a tradition adopted by him.     Dr. Prichard does not-deem
it expedient directly to attack the position from which that con
sequence flowed, but asks
                                "whether St. Matthew and St. Luke
were in want of inspiration when they had recourse to pre
viously existing documents in compiling their genealogies ?"
It  might have occurred to him, that inspiration would in that
case be superfluous.       The knowledge of the genealogies was
within the reach of uninspired persons, their materials being
recorded  in  sacred writ, while the successive events of the crea
tion could with certainty be known to no hitman being unless
by immediate inspiration.       The ingenious imagination of sort               a
of circuitous inspiration enabling its possessor to discriminate
what had been already revealed, will scarcely bear          philosophic  a
scrutiny: but were    it even admissible,     would at least be ne
                                                 it
cessary to prove the previous existence of the supposed' original
                                                 it, by
revelation, somewhat less vaguely than         conjectures insufficient
to ascertain the person favoured with           or even to determine
the period in which    it was made.
    Dr. Prichard does not combat my application of his critical
canon to the assumed metaphorical sense of day; but with re
ference to the disputed meaning of that word asks, whether se
veral expressions relating to God, such as " God rested on the
seventh day," are to be understood literally or figuratively.         It
is obvious that such expressions may without incongruity           lan          of
guage bear either     a figurative or literal sense    and in fact the
                                                                ;
one or the other has been given them, according to the more or
less just notions entertained of the divinity.       The case of the
word day as employed in the six days creation            conspicuously
                                                                    is
different:   ifunderstood literally, the evening and morning con
nected with    ithave an assignable meaning                   if

counter to their acceptation of all Hebrew expressions, in viola
tion of sense and congruity of language.        As he expresses some                       ,

 endeavour to atone for the omission by remarking, that if he
 rest the metaphorical sense of the word day on their authority,
 he must also on the same authority admit a figurative sense of
 the whole first chapter of Genesis ; for he savs that Josephus and
 Philo " expressly affirm that the account of the six days work
 is metaphorical."       Now, that the simple relation of the creation-
 given by Moses, or what Dr. Prichard terms the
                                                       " Exordium of
 the Hebrew Scriptures," would be rendered more " capable of a
 rational nrd philosophical interpretation," by being converted
 into an allegory, may perhaps not be quite obvious to ordinary
 understandings.
    I shall occupy but little more of your time. Dr. Prichard
 informs us that Moses did not write the " Cosmogony with the
 Systema Natures before him," — that
                                             " the Hebrew language
 being very poor in terms of classification, a few leading objects
 rn each class are mentioned ; and we are left to understand that
 the analogous kinds were conjoined with those named."              On
 this account he very properly retains forest trees, shrubs, and li
 chens in the third day's creation, although in strictness none of
 them come under the description of " grass, seed-bearing herbs,
or fruit-bearing trees." On the same principle, were there no
 particular end to answer by the exclusion, it may be thought
 that zoophytes might be permitted to remain in the fifth day's
creation, being moving creatures that have life, although their
motion does not precisely accord with the idea which, in opposU
tion to the received translation, Dr. Prichard thinks the Sep-
tuagint and the original convey.         Be this as it may, that the
"coincidences which he called upon us to admire were perfected
by his placing orders of beings where Moses never placed them,
remains incontrovertible.         This liberty he seems to consider
trifling: he has however gone still further. Even his own ver
sion of the 20th verse of the first chapter of Genesis does not
exclude testacea from the fifth day's creation ; a considerable
portion of the order being indisputably endued with the power
of loco-motion.       It follows, that what he calls the coincidences
   between the Cosmogony and the epochs of nature" were ef
fected not simply by placing orders of animated beings where
Moses had not placed them, but by his placing, at least, one or-i
der in direct contradiction to the express authority of Moses.

LXX.    Account of a Meteonc Stone which fell in the Environs
   of Langres.  Communicated to M. Virey by M. PisToi.LE-r,
   Physician at Langres*.
  X our love for the natural sciences, and the success with which
you cultivate them, induce me to communicate to you a meteoro
 logical phfenomenou which has just taken place in the commune
of Chassigny, a village situated to the south-east of Langres,
.and about four leagues distant.
    On the 3d of October 18 15, at half past eight in the morning,
 the sky being clear and serene, and a gentle east wind prevailing,
 a rumbling noise was heard like the discharge of musketry and
 artillery. This noise, which seemed to come from the north-east,
and from a cloud which hung over the horizon of an indeter
 minate form and a gray colour, had lasted a few minutes, when
a man at work in a vineyard at some distance from the village,
and who had his eyes fixed on this cloud, hearing a whistling
like that of a cannon ball, saw an opaque body fall a few paces
 from him, and which emitted a dense smoke.            Having run to
 the spot, he saw a deep hole in the ground, and around it were
 fragments of stone of a peculiar kind.       Having picked up one
of the pieces, he found it as hot as if it had been long exposed
 to a strong sun ; he brought it into the village, and several in
 habitants went out in consequence and collected pieces.         Next
day I visited the village; and having obtained oneof the fragments,
 I found it resembled closely au aerolite which had been sent me
from Germany.        Having proceeded to the spot in person, I col
lected about sixty small pieces, some of which were soft and wet,
 and easily crumbled in the hand.
    The ball of fire which generally accompanies aerolites, was not
perceived in this instance.     Having weighed all the pieces which
were collected, the whole weight was four kilogrammes.         I have
no doubt that all these fragments belonged to the same stone ;
and I am even inclined to think that what I saw was only a piece
of a larger stone which had exploded in the air. I am in pos
session of a piece weighing nearly one kilogramme, which is the
 half of a corner piece only, and which leads me to suppose that
 the whole stone must have weighed eight kilogrammes.         Its very
 considerable specific gravity, as is remarked in all those stones, is
not the same however in every fragment, some of which seem to
present more density.      Differences are also remarked in the co
lour of the crust which covers these various pieces : in some it
is a very deep black, and in others of a chesnut-brown only; and
in general the less black the colour                   is,
                                              the more shining and

elevations or swellings are observed, which have the appearance
of being the produce af an ebullition suddenly interrupted.
    I had almost forgot to say that some persons in the village of    -
Chassigny and parts adjacent, who happened to be sitting on
the ground, thought they felt the shock of an earthquake during
the detonation ; but the peasant who saw the stone fall expe
rienced no such sensation.       I ought to inform you also, that at
the bottom of the hole made by the fall of the stone there was
a piece of the lava of the country, which might induce one to
believe that the aerolite was broken only in consequence of
meeting with a hard body; but what appears to contradict this
is, that none of the aerolite remained in this hole; that, on the
contrary, all the fragments were dispersed in such minute pieces
that it seemed rather as if they were the consequence of an ex
plosion than of a fracture occasioned by the fall : — fmally, se
veral small pieces were imbedded deeply in the earth around the
 hole.    Besides all this, the smoke perceived at the moment of
the fall denotes something else than a simple fracture : yet it is
 astonishing that an explosion did not scatter the fragments
further ; for one piece which was found a few days afterwards,
 could not have been sent there since the fall, and as a conse
 quence of the explosion, but seems rather to have fallen at the
 same time with that which was separated into so many parts.
         Analysis  of the  Gbove  Aerolite, by M. Vauquei.in.
                          Physical Characters.
     1 . Colour : brown externally, pearl gray internally.
    2. Contexture: grainy, and broken in every direction.
    3. Solidity: very slight, crumbling with the greatest facility.
    4. Aspect: shining, and as if varnished.
    5. Sound: none. Although it appears to have been roasted,
it has not ti e dryness nor the hardness of glass when it is
broken : it seems on the contrary to be soft under the pestie,
 which soon pounds it.
    6. It has no action on the magnetic needle, and yet the crust
 with which it is covered has a slight effect : this announces that
it contains iron in the state of oxide.            • -
    7. It forms a jelly with the acids. Hence it must be concluded
that the silex is therein combined with some principle.
                                Analysis.
    Without entering into large details on the means employed to
 analyse this aerolite, I am nevertheless of opinion that it will
 not be useless rapidly to explain the course which I pursued.
                                                          I subjected

               which fell in the Environs of Langres.              351
    1 subjected   ten grammes of the aerolite reduced into fine
powder to the action of the sulphuric acid diluted with water.
The decomposition took place without effervescence: — the only
phaenomena observed were a development of heat and a diminu
tion of volume in the substance submitted to experiment.
     Nevertheless the whole mass did not disappear: there re
mained a grayish substance, which the sulphuric acid even aided
by heat eannot dissolve : it forms nearly the tenth part of the
aerolite.
     The sulphuric acid does not acquire any colour in this opera
tion : in the state of dilution in which it was employed, it was
almost as white as water.
     There are remarkable differences between this aerolite and
 all that have been hitherto examined.
     All the latter, on being dissolved in the sulphuric or weak
 muriatic acid, gave out hydrogen gas partly sulphuretted, and
 generally furnished a solution of a green colour deeper than that
 of iron : the present aerolite exhibited nothing similar.         This
 proves that this aerolite contains no iron in the metallic state
 which the magnet had already announced, and that there is no
 nickel in it, which, as we know, makes its solutions green, and is
 itself acted upon by the magnet.
     The solution being effected, the liquor was decanted and
 washed, and the residue evaporated to dryness. At the end of
 the operation a transparent jelly was formed, produced by the
 separation of the silex, which being washed and dried, weighed
 three grammes and one centieme.
     The liquor, which ought to contain magnesia and iron, was
  again evaporated to dryness, and the residue calcined for at least
  half an hour. The matter, which had assumed a red colour, was
  put into water, in order to dissolve the sulphate of magnesia : it
  was filtered in order to collect the red oxide of iron.
      The sulphate of magnesia must be evaporated and calcined
  three times, in order to separate entirely the sulphate of iron.
      The different quantities of oxide of iron obtained in these
  operations having been collected and dried, weighed three
  grammes and ten centiemes.        This oxide was of a very lively
  red colour.
      The sulphate of magnesia when purified and calcined weighed
  eight grammes seven-tenths,        in which there is about three
   grammes    two-tenths  of magnesia.    This salt was then tolerably
   white, very soluble in water, and had the bitter taste which
   belongs to the natural sulphate of magnesia : lastly, it appeared
   to be pure.    Nevertheless, in order to ascertain if it did not con-;
   tain nickel or some other metal, I put hydro-sulphuret of. pot
                                                                     ash

                                            a
I ascribe to some traces of manganese rather than to nickel;
and yet there was so small      quantity that

been perceptible in the scales.
   The sulphuric acid, therefore, in acting on this aerolite, had
only dissolved the magnesia, the silex, and the iron.

                                  Sulphuric Acid.
    It was interesting to examine the nature of the portion of the
meteoric stone which refused to be dissolved                 the sulphuric
                                                                 in
acid:    itmust necessarily have been of
                    .                               nature different from
                                                     a
that which had been dissolved.
    This residue when examined with the glass seemed to be com
posed of two different substances            one in white and brilliant
                                                ;
particles ;   the  other  black,  and  giving to the mixture of both                    a
slate-gray   colour.
    The acids not having any action on this residue,              treated
                                                                      I                 it

                                             a
fused and cold had          greenish-yellow colour
                             a                           when diluted in
                                                             ;
water    itcommunicated to          it   beautiful yellow colour, which
                                         a
left no doubt as to the presence of chrome.          After having washed
this matter until        no longer gave colour to the water
                        it                                             satu    1
rated the liquor with the nitric acid, and evaporated to dryness.
On treating this residue again with water, the nitrate of potash
and chromic acid were dissolved, and there remained silex, which
I  set aside, in order to add         to that which we had previously
                                     it
obtained and to that of which we are going to speak.
    The nitrate of mercury put into the above yellow liquor, in
fact produced a precipitate of fine orange red.
                                       a
    The portion of the residue treated              by
                                                  potash, and which was
not dissolved in the water, was treated with the nitric acid, which
dissolved the greatest quantity of it: that which            left was of
                                                                 it                     a
very deep gray colour         the nitric solution evaporated to dryness
                              :
with care, and the residue taken up with water sharpened                 ni        by
tric acid, left     white powder which was still silex.
                    a
    The nitric solution examined with care, did not exhibit any
iron, and not an atom of nickel.
    The portion of the residue which had resisted the acid and
the alkali, and which had          adeep gray colour, appeared to be
pure   metallic  chrome,    and  perhaps   with an alloy of iron never     :
theless  it was   not affected   by  the  magnet.    What       certain is,
                                                                      is

                                 Remarks.
   We remark here : 1st, that the Langres stone contains neither
sulphur nor nickel, and that the iron in it is entirely oxidated ;
whereas all the other aerolites contain those two substances, and
the iron has always been in the metallic state, at least for the
most part.     2dly, That a part of the silex contained in the stone
is only in the state of mixture in the sandy form, and that an
other more abundant portion than the first is entirely combined
with the magnesia, and probably with the iron, since it is dis
solved at the same time with those two bodies in the sulphuric
acid.    3dly, That there is in the present stone twice as much
magnesia as in those which have been hitherto analysed : per
haps its softness was owing to this cause.            4thly, Lastly, the
chrome is found in it in the metallic state, which announces that
it must have resisted the oxidnting action which burnt the iron.
The quantity of this metal is also more considerable than usual.
   It is probable, that if the sulphur has existed primitively in
this stone, it must have been dissipated at the moment when the
iron was fused.
   The absence of nickel from this stone found at Langres is
the more remarkable, as it has been constantly found in all other
aerolites.
             LXXI.    On the   Metallic Salts.       By G. S,
                            To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —    In  my last   I stated, that Mr. H. asserted the metallic
salts  to be super-salts with excess of oxide; I made the same
statement in a former paper, and combated it without anv' charge
   Vol. 47. No. 217. May 1816.                      Z                 «f

$54           Mr v   Farey' s Intioductory Remarks, to
of perversion:    but having since been charged by Mr. H. with a
misrepresentation to favour my own views, I beg you to make
room for a few quotations from 1lis paper (vol. xlv. p. 463), which
I conceive to warrant my statement.
    After submitting sulphat of iron to a heat sufficient to drive
off a portion of the acid, he says, '* Water being added, the super
sulphat was in solution, and some oxide precipitated."           Again,
he says, that the sulphat and sub-sulphat of mercury          " are not
perfect salts, but peculiar mixtures of the super sulphat with the
oxide." And, lastly, that as the sulphat of mercury is acid when
water is added,    "  it must in the dry state be a?i acid salt with an
excess of oxide mixed with it."
    It is time to quit this subject, which must have become tedious
 to your readers, without affording them any real information :

 LXXII. A       Letter from       Dr. William Richardson to the
    Countess  of  Gosford     (occasioned by the Perusal of Cuvikr's
    " Geological    Essay"), describing the Arrangement of the
    Strata for 60 Miles on the South and. as many on the North
    of Gosford Castle, in Armagh County in Ireland. Com
    municated by Mr. John Farev, Sen.; with some preliminary
    Remarks and illustrative Notes by him.
                             To   Mr.  Tilloch.
Sir, — The        printed Letter sent herewith, having been put into
my hands by a Friend, I am anxious to see the same permanently
preserved in your Magazine, with a few explanatory Notes, which
 I have taken the liberty of subjoining thereto, partly for the pur
pose of explaining, more clearly than was perhaps necessary
for Dr. R. to do, to his noble Correspondent, or even to most
of his Irish readers, the situations of the places mentioned,
partly for referring to former Papers inserted in your Work, on
this same subject, for asking some questions, &c.
    Dr. Richardson, as many of your Readers know, is the author
of a highly valuable and curious paper on the Basaltic Strata,
and Hummocks of the Counties of Antrim and
                                                      Deny, pages 102
and 194 of your thirty- third volume ; of another
                                                       equally valuable
                                                                  paper

       The very able, and, with him I believe, original manner, in
  which Dr. Richardson went about and completed the investiga-
. tiott* of the stupendous Strata and

                                                                                   under
      * The manner or mnde of investigation here alluded to, received some years ago
  from me the name of Mineral Surveying, a British Art (orisinating with ?,lr. IFnu
  Smith) differing most e sen ially from the microscopic i-oreings over the indivi-
  dnal stones or subs:ances met with while examining the surface of the Earth, to
  whieh-?nere Mineralogists,      or mere Naturalists, however eminent oi txpert, are
  too prone, to a;tend to much else; and differing most essentially also, from the
  wild theoretical deductions from insufficient examination, to which Wernerian,
  Huttonian, and otl>er partisans of the now fashionable Schools, are addicted, and
  whose dogmas, respeetivel>'| they too often support, with much of injustice, acri-'
  ffiunv, and personality.
      Mineral Surveying is so much more of a Mathematical, Mechanical, Graphical
  or Surveying' art, than a Minora logical me, (if such be understood as nicely dis
  criminating ail mineral Species,) that the term 'f Mineral" was prefixed to that of
  "Surveying, ' more for the purpose of marking its distinction from Land Sur
  veying, Maritime Surveying, House Surveying. &e. than of claiming rank for its
  professors, amongst those technical         Mineralogists, Crystallographers,   Concho-
  iogists» Chemists. Sec. who laudablv devote their time and the energies of their
  minds, to the investigations and the analysis, of the Cabinet-room and the Labo
  ratory : all which are arts and pursuits, I beg to repeat, which I hold in g-eat esti
  mation and respect (although time and circumstances will not admit of my parti
  cular application 10 them) ; and I have only similar feelings towards their Pro
 fessors, indi vidua I ly, wherever their own personal conduct w II admit, of such feeling*
  towards them, be ng entertained.         I have said thus much here, as the only reply
  1 can descend to make to the Geoguostic Journalist, who at the commencement
  of the year, taking example and courage from anotherin p. 363, &c. of your
  last volume, nnprovokedly and untruly has aspersed my writings, knowledge and
  conduct, on and relating to the hardly acquired Profession by which I honestly
  support my Family, and benefit my Employers, as I have the satisfaction of
  often being told, afterwards, and particularly so, where I have happened to go
  sverany grounds on which confident Geognosts have preceded me.
      A very competent knowledge of Rural ajfhirs, and of the Commerce and Me
  chanic Arts and Manufactures any way connected with raw mineral substances , joined
  with correct knowledge and expertness in Mapping, and in the Geometrical in
  vestigations of the internal structures of solid [ami iated Bodies, from observations
  made on their surfaces and in local perforations; — these I will venture to say,
  are of vastly greater consequence, as preliminary qualifications, for making Mi
  neral Surveying Useful to Land and Mineral Owners, or in useful investiga'ions of
  the structure of the crust of the Earth, than all the knowledge, how or likely to
  be possessed by, mere technical Mineralogies, See. great, improved and improving/, -
  and taeful also in their proper places, as I fully admit their acquirements to be.
      And I will maintain, that such a knowledge of the ex emal characters, struc
  tures, a'm" chemical compositions of the most common, and the most commonly
  -useful Minerals      as is now very easily and soon to bu attained, by any one,
  Rurally and Commercially or practically ucquaivledt as above mentioned, is all of
  their tectum a! know led^e, that a M;neral Surveyor will ever find occasion for in
  the field, or while expensively exploytd out from home: his business then being,
  to search for and ex>d r - evcy considerable or well dufiHed Mass, whatever, on
  mfler examination, may turn out to be its technical name, composition, or uses, its
  novelty, alleged Geoguostic importance         or what not, to map and describe on
  fhe spot (s-ometimes by Section, as well as Map) the positions, thicknesses, contor
  tions', dislocations, denudation*,   &o, of orerv such Mass; notcing~ the local name
                                              Z2                                         or

                      Mr. Farey's Introductory          Remarks , to
under the very puzzling and deceptive appearances they assume"*
was such, as to lay impartial Geological inquirers under the
greatest obligations : and few such have in consequence been able
to refrain from lamenting, that now for several years past, the
attention of so very able a Geological investigator should have
been, as far as they have known, entirely diverted from this,
perhaps, his proper pursuit, in which he might have rendered
them and science such important services, and done himself such
extensive and lasting credit, in order, perseveringly to attempt the
conversion of English Farmers, unfortunately a vain attempt, as
to the almost miraculous properties and produce of Fiorin Grass
Or names, uses, and appearances      of every kind, which experience in such exami
nations and details will suggest; and in no instance neglecting to collect, wrap-
up, mark, describe the exact locality, bring away and preserve, sufficient Speci
mens of each andevery substance seen, which shall appear different from each other,
of the imbedded and extraneous Fossils, &c. &c.
    When returned home, and before sitting down to digest a Report, either to an
^Employer or to the Public in print, the Specimens abovementioued will be all de
liberately examined, named, described, and analysed in some cases, either by (he
Mineral Surveyor himself, if his knowledge aud Time admit (which most probably
they will not) or by some more experienced and practical Mineralogist and Che
mist: in neither of which respectable and useful Professions is it now very diffi
cult, to obtain able assistance in the way of descriptions and analyses, on defined
pecuniary terms. And thus may every useful information and result of Mineral
Surveys be furnished, to private Employers or to the Public, with advantages,
no other way attainable.
    I must not conclude this long Note without mentioning, that the above-de-'
scribed process and proceeding on a Mineral Survey and Report, refers to a case,
wherein no limits had been prescribed or wished by the Employer, as to time or ex
pense, for collecting and detailing,    the most perfect and ample information,     re
garding a particular Estate or Mineral tract: but that more commonly in his
practice, only particular objects of inquiry and elucidation, are previously pointed
out for the Mineral Surveyor, and who then goes no further into general investi
gation, than will materially conduce to explain the objects and extent of ground,
so referred to his examination.
    So also, if a Parish or larger District be ordered to be Minerally surveyed, with
 no more expense than is unavoidable, for obtaining information as to its structure,
leading features and contents, the process above will be much abridged - and still
more so, in conducting a County or larger Survey :         but in no instance, will the
Careful and industrious Mineral Surveyor omit,, taking and bringing home and
preserving, ?iumirous Specimens, from different points of every different and to
 lerably defined mass or stratum, and of their imbedded Fossils, &c. which he may
 examine.      Some years previous to commencing Mineral Surveyor as a Profession,
 1 began, and have ever since followed up this practice, until several thousand
 Specimens, 1 think, have accumulated on my hands, all accurately marked as to
 locality ai:il reference to my memorandums, written on the spots : and I mean to
 persevere therein, with equal or more zeal than ever; although it be too much
 to be feared, that my time or the expense may not be spareable, for their descrip
 tion and arrangement, so as to be useful to others besides myself and my Sons.
     1 will embrace this opportunity of requesting my Friends to notice, my Re
 moval from Upper Crown Street, to Howland Sireet, and that my Son, the En
 gineer (aud Draughtsman and writer on Mechanical Subjects) has removed hither
 with me.                                                     „              .

faithfully related.
 -  These circumstances, occasioned me to be much pleased at
observing, from the commencement of the Letter sent herewith,
that Dr. Richardson had again resumed Geological subjects, and
had attentively read, and in manuscript commented on, M. Cu-
vier's Essay.     Although I will not say with Dr, R., that ""I take
Riuch pleasure in exposing the vain tollies of world-making gen-
]try," I must confess, that on reading the Essay alluded to, I saw
therein, so much of hasty and unphilosophical assumption and
generalization,    at variance with most or all of the facts which I
have yet seen for myself, on the Earth's surface or beneath                   it,
that beg thus to intreat Dr. R. to give publicity through your
      I
Magazine, to his Notes on M. Cuvier's Essay, in which case                    I
promise to follow him with my Notes thereon,
    For obviating the difficulty to which the Doctor alludes, at the
conclusion of his fifth paragraph, (p. 35S)      would beg to recom
                                                    I

dissent: aud as giving, with the least possible of useless repeti

 I    presume to hope likewise, now that Dr. R. has returned to
my favourite pursuit, he will give an attentive reading and conT
sideration to my paper on the Strata of Antrim, compiled from
his own writings and those of other Irish observers, in your
xxxixth volume, and which he will find several -times referred to,
in my Notes sent herewith        and that he will, ere long, furnish
                                   :
you,   at some   length,  with his candid and free remarks on what
I  have done and suggested in that paper, as to the proper classi
fication of the Strata considered on the great scale, on their real
super-positions,     and their forms, as constituting troughs aud
ridges   ; the latter of which when sudden, may present the ap
pearance of rearing or almost vertical strata, on their sides; and
to which original cause, all of such very highly inclined strata,
which have anywhere examined, can evidently he referred, and

    " When     your ladyship was so good as to lend me the pamphlet,
I return with thanks, and to encourage               me to make marginal
observations, 1 expected to have found (what 1 have been long
looking for) materials for a con'rover•y with the Neptunians, or
as thev are now sometimes called, the Wernnrians: for Mr. Cu-
vier Is avowedlv of that school, and Dr. Jameson was anxious
to become a' missionary, and to come over from Scotland, to
disseminate in this country the Neptunian heresy.
    "  I know he has for some years been speculating on the con
version of Ireland, being rather worsted in Scotland, by the su
perior energy of his antagonists, supporting theories equally
weak with his own, and I announced to Dr. Jameson, through a
friend and pupil of his, that so soon as he published here, any of
his Neptunian doctrines, 1 should instantly encounter him.
    "  In truth, I take much pleasure in exposing the vain follies of
world-making gentry, and having sharply discussed the theories
 of the Hut Ionian Plutonists, and also of the Vblcanists, without
being able to extort a reply; I hoped for an opportunity of
showing, that the Neptunians were just as little entitled to cre
 dit or belief.
    "When an Essay on the Theory of the Earth, was published
by Mr. Cuvier, and edited in Edinburgh by Dr. Jameson, with
 mineralogical notes of his own annexed, I was sure I had got
 what I wanted, and that i should find Neptunian doctrines and
 positions abundantly sufficient for the encounter.
     " I was disappointed ; Mr. Cuvier's Essay, well stuffed with
 curious and popular topics*, was nothing like a Theory of the
 Earth; but merely intended to give notice of the approach of
 his mighty work on the Fossil bones, found in the calcareous
 quarries near Paris ; and as to Dr. Jameson's preface, and what
 he calls mineralogical notes; I have commented on them in the
 margin, with your ladyship's permission: for the public these
 notes would be useless without the essay, which I am not at li
 berty to print.
    "  No general statement in either, of the opinions supported
 by the Neptunians; no history of the formation of the earth,
    * " I should  he sorry to sav any thing disrespectful of Mr. Cuvier.    I
 am aware   of the infinite labour he has expended, and the ingenuity he has
 exerted upon the fossil bones, /ound in so many calcareous strata; but as
 a geologist or cosmogonist,   I am not yet acquainted with him, and  I hope
 when he shall suttain positions relative to original formation and arrange
 ment, he. will sustain them from more general and diversified data than
 merely the animal exuvia: he has studied so much,
                                                                         and

  >and   arrangement of its materials, as sustained by their school ;
  no general positions or propositions are laid down, so as to ad
  mit being controverted.
      "  A numerous mass of assertions of geological facts, is arbi
  trarily produced, without any reference to the places where they
  are to be found ; besides these arrangements and facts, so deci
  dedly pronounced, are generally false — mere inventioiis to -coun
  tenance the Neptunian theory, in whose support they are de
  vised.
      " No other theory sets out so plausibly as the Neptunian; for
  its advocates show, they were once in possession of the greater
  part of the world, by the marine exuviae so generally dispersed :
  but when we enter into detail, and examine the arrangements of
  our strata, and the circumstances attending them, the incom
  patibility of these facts, with Neptunian opinions, becomes m*
  stantly apparent ; hence no doubt, they so involve themselves in
  loose assertions, that they are not to be caught hold of.
      " As to the diversity of opinions on the formation and arrange*
  ments of the materials of our world, Mr. Cuvier gives us nine
  or ten pages, commencing with the 40th, containing a list of
   world-makers, who seem to have thought that Nature had
   whispered her secret in their ear, and that they are able to de
   tail her proceedings, and develope all her operations; six of
   these are great men; the opinions of six or seven more, he states
   without their names, and then he tells us, he could add twenty
   to the list.
       "  Now I venture to say, every one of these philosophers has
   fallen into the same error, and from the same cause; they have
   every one looked inwards, and consulted their own imaginations,
  'how things might be done — while not one of them looked out
   wards, and took a cool view of the face of Nature, to make
-  themselves acquainted with what had actually been done.
       " They had in their hands a mighty subject, the world,
   which they assumed to be a vast whole, formed and arranged by
   great and general causes, acting uniformly; and of course in
   ferred that the corresponding effects must be general and uni
    form.
       "  It never occurred to  these  philosophers, to examine if the
   world before them corresponded with these ideas ; nor to in
    quire if the effects were general, as they had assumed the causes
    to be.    Had they examined, they would have found the state of
    things very different — no trace of a general operation — effects
    local, partial, diminutive, and unconnected.
       " If the world is to be considered as a whole, it will be found
    composed of most heterogeneous parts, an infinite number of

junction of two systems: in the one to the northward, and at
 the Cave, the number of basaltic strata is five or six, differing
 considerably from each other, as appears by their colour and

 they are arranged.
     " Such a variety of diminutive arrangements must baffle all
 speculation upon general causes and grand operations.
     " I am so far guilty of the same fault I censure in Mr. Cuvier,
stating arrangements, without pointing to places where they are
 to be verified.
     " Let us look to Spain. Mr. Townsend, a modern traveller,
who seems quite free from system, in his tour through that
 country, always states the change of material as it occurred in
his passage through natural districts, from schistus to limestone,
 to basalt, to granite, to sandstone, to gypsum; and so on.
     " What has your ladyship to do with Spain ? I should not
have mentioned this diversified arrangement, had I not been
able to establish it in my own country, and with hopes of having
your ladyship for my witness.
     " You yourself are fixed on a most interesting spot*, at the
southern extremity of the great basaltic area, while the Giant's
Causeway itself, and our magnificent columnar facades, form it*
northern boundary: close to Gosford castle we find the lastf re

we look to the stupendous magnificence of the grand whole, or
the exquisite neatness of the execution.

distinguishable, but faintly marked, and not failing from decay but

ness of the work, is perpetually varying from nearly and com
pletely amorphous, to the exquisite finishing of the Giant's

"frill encounter such an assemblage          of little systems, as I have
stated to compose the surface of our world.
     " Go due south, and at the quarry of Markethill, you leave
the basaltic area, and enter a schistose district, which continues
for some ten miles, when you enter the gray granite district, ex
tending from the summit of the Mourne mountain*, by Newry,
and Slieve Gullian, crossing the Forkil road, but not reaching so
far west, as the Newtownhamilton road.
     " Near Dundalk you enter a new district of argillaceous
schistus, having crossed an interesting spot well worth examining,
as a little to the north-west of Dundalk three extensive, cal
careous districts converge towards each other : one from Car-
lingford to the eastward : another from Ball's Mill to the north
west; the third from Ardee to the south-west |- ; whether all
secondary limestone, whether they actually meet at the point
they converge towards, or how near they approach, remains to
be inquired into.
      " The Ball's Mill and Ardee districts are separated from each
other by a schistose district.
      " At Dundalk J, a new and extensive district of argillaceous
schistus commences ; in the hills above Dunleer, they are often
crossed by veins of quartz ; near Drogheda we enter a calcareous
district, very important to that country.
     " On the south side of Drogheda we first meet the stone called
calp, described by the Hon. Geo. Knox, in the Transactions of
the Royal Irish Academy; its strata seem to me to deviate more
from rectilinear planes, and to vary more suddenly in their in
clination, than any other stone I am acquainted with.
     " At Cloughran church we find a calcareous district, or rib,
stretching § from the foot of the hill of Howth, by Raheny and
Cloughran, into the country of Meath ; the boundaries of this
valuable district, I am unacquainted with, but observe its com
ponent strata more inclined to the horizon than any other lime
stone I have met with.
     " Immediately south of Dublin || the calp is resumed, and in
three miles we enter the granite district, stretching               from the
sea up to the mountains.            The quarry stone used for building in
Dublin is calp, and the cut stone gray gramte.
     " As we enter Wicklow county, we find a new hard stone
strongly blended with quartz; of this Bray Head and the Sugar-
Loaf Hills are formed. I could not find whether it was stratified

or not ; but neither in Ireland nor Scotland did I ever find gra
nite stratified; a point much contested by naturalists, as the
stratification of granite is necessary to some of their theories,
adverse to others.
     " Proceeding due west*, we again change our material in
Powerscourt Park, which now becomes micaceous schistic, and
it is over a mighty stratified facade of this stone, the Powers-
court waterfall is precipitated.
     " I believe the Wicklow material is mostly schistus, and on
Croghan mountain, near the termination of the Military Road,
I saw a beautiful junction of schistus and granite           f.  distinct and
rectilinear, the granite and schistus passing into each other as
much per saltum as the pieces of a Mosaic.
 '    "  Though your ladyship may be tired of this long tour to the
southward, I must make vou acquainted with the arrangements
in your own immediate neighbourhood.
      "  Travel northward X by Richhill road ; at the end of your
own wall, you enter an extensive schistose distrist, spreading to
the westward bevond the Newtownhamilton road ; but on tha
eastward for1 several miles, you have the basaltic area within
200 or 300 yards of you, not indeed more than two miles broad,
and hounded on the eastward by a great schistose stratum,
spreading into the county of Down.
      "  At Kilmore§ you come direct on a great calcareous distriet,
stretching from the westward of Portadown, by Loughga'.l and
Armagh, far to the westward j| ; and to the northwest by Gores-
 town, Clonfecle and Benburb ^f, where the Blackwater, passing
 through a deep ravine, shows the limestone stratum, or accumu
 lation of strata, to be above 200 feet thick.
      "  Had you gone** direct to Armagh, near the town you
 would have crossed a new arrangement of stone, resembling ba
 salt in colour and in its subdivisions: Mr. Weaver tells me it is
 srgillite strongly impregnated with quartz.
       " Had your ladyship stuck to the boundary of the basaltic
  area, it would have brought you very near both Richhill and
  Portadown, leaving them to the west ; thence direct to Lough-

   " On the southern part of this boundary*, westward of Lough
Neagh, granite seems to preponderate, and I have found red
granite in abundance in the- parish of Kildress ; but when we
enter Derry, the area for a great way to the westward is schistus,
mixed with numerous quarries of stratified sandstone, and pri
mitive limestone, blue, crystallized and tmstratified.
   " Had your ladyshipf kept by the eastern boundary of the ba
saltic area, it would have led you, as the area increased in width,
to Magheralin X, where you would have encountered a new va
riety of limestone, quite different from all I have mentioned, and
particularly that near it at Kilmore ; the latter a brownish red,
free from flints, while the Magheralin and Moira limestone, and
all the strata northward, are pure white and full of flints.

  by a barometrical survey the relative height of the Black Sea
  and the Caspiau Sea, and to measure the height of the most re
  markable points of the chain of the Caucasus.              The work in
  which they have published the fruits of their researches appeared
  at Berlin in 1815.
      The relative height of the two seas was ascertained twice ; viz.
   1st, in going from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea; and 2dly,
  in returning from the Caspian Sea to the point of departure. Our
  travellers attempted to make corresponding observations at the
  level of the two seas; but this mode of verification succeeded
  very imperfectly.
      The distance levelled from the mouth of the Kuban in the
  Black Sea, to the mouth of the Terek on the shores of the Cas
  pian Sea, pursuing the sinuosities of the post road which the
  two travellers traversed, is 990 wersts*.        If a straight line, this ,
  distance would be merely 813 wersts, corresponding to about
  9j°of difference of longitude: the two extreme points are almost
- under the same parallel.
      All the details of this vast operation are given at full length,
  and seem to deserve great confidence.         Cistern barometers were
  used ; but the correction of the level was made by calculation,
   which is very easy, the interior diameter of the tube being
   known.
      A thermometer fixed into the mounting of the instrument gave
  the temperature of the mercury : another thermometer at liberty
   made known the temperature of the air at the moment of the
   observation ; the scales had been rectified according to the mea
   surement known by astronomers under the name of fathom of
   Peru; a stand made for the purpose with a leaden wire ad
   mitted of the tubes being placed in a vertical position ; an
   anemometer gave the direction and strength of the wind, and
   consequently the measurement of the degree of confidence which
   every partial levelling seemed to deserve.         The indications of
   the barometer are always expressed in lOOdth parts of a line,
   and great care was taken to compare the instruments, before,
   after, and during the operation : in order to avoid all errors
   which might arise from derangements of this kind, the observers
   metievery two days. They remained- long enough at every sta
   tion to take four distinct barometrical heights, and at intervals
   of 15' at least: the epochs of these observations always corre
   sponded perfectly.      Every hour of the day is not equally favour
   able in this kind of measurement; but it did not depend on the
   travellers to select the hour of twelve at noon, which is generally
   that which answers best. Their observations, however, were
                    * J0t'3 wersts make 1° of the meridian.
                                                                    always

 36S               On the relative Heights      of the Levels
 always made between six in the morning and eight in the
 evening.
     It may be easily supposed from all these precautions that M.
 Parrot must have calculated his operation with great care : thus
 he made use of the formula of M. Laplace and of the coefficient
  18393 metres which M. Ramond had found in the Pyrenees,
 almost under the very same parallel with the Caucasus, having
 in view at the same time the capillary depression of the mercury.
 The only correction of which he could not keep an ^account wa»
 that of the diminution of gravity.
     The number of stations comprehended between the mouth of
 the Kuban and that of the Terek is 51 ; they were, therefore,
 distant from each other about 18 wersts or 13 miles.              The first
 measurement commenced on -the 13th of July, beginning with
 the island of Taman*, and proceeding eastward, ascending the
 Kuban to Batal-Paschinsk near Constantinogorks, where th*
 29th station was. Our travellers set out from this point to
    * The isle of Tainan is remarkable by its springs of asphaltus, and its
 foaming volcanoes, which have been partly described bv Pallas in bis
 Travels of 1793 and 179-1.      Messrs. Parrot and Eugelhardt visited the
 small volcanoes situated between the city of Taman and the lake Sueur.
 On the slope of a hilt they discovered two basins of \6 metres aperture
 and two metres and a half deep, and which were filled with a frothy mass
 formed of argil and water.     From time to time thev saw rise to the sur
 face of each crater a bubble of air about a foot in diameter: the instanc
 it burst a great number of similar small balls took its place. This phseno-.
 roenon was repeated every 80 or 40 seconds. The temperature of the
 water differed little from that of the air: the water at 29'4° of the centi
 grade thermometer, the thermometer in the sun marked 2-99°, and in the
 nhade 26'9r. The travellers wanted proper instruments for examining the
 nature of the air extricated by the crater; they merely ascertained that
 it leas not inflammable, and that it did not keep up combustion. The water,
 which was yellowish, had a saltish taste: in the bottom were found frag
 ments of bituminous limestone, selenite, and quartzous freestone. It seems
 that these small basins underwent some considerable changes at the time
 of the great eruption which took place in 1794 in the northern part of the
 ba^
       of Taman.    In 1807 near Kurgan the Cossacks heard a subterraneous
.noise similar to a discharge of artillery.    The mountain was enveloped
with a thick smoke ; but speedily they saw issue slowly from the bowels of
 the yawning earth a new hill, as large as a house.      Large masses of cal
 careous stone were thrown about here and there, but no flame was per
ceived.     In the vicinity near Bugos, fountains of asphaltus or liquid mi
neral tar were found, which issue from secondary layers of freestone and
schistous limestone.
    These phenomena of frothy volcanoes put us in mind of that of Cuma-
 cntar, on the coast of Paria; the argillaceous and impregnated plains of

according to M. Humboldt send forth azotic gas much purer thau is
gent-ally obtained in the laboratories of the chemists.
                                                                       make

make excursions in the Caucasus, which lasted from the 17th of
August to the 3d of October, and during which they measured
the Kasbeck, a peak as high as Mount Blanc.          They resumed
their labours on the 4th of October, and continued them follow
ing the Terek to the delta which it forms in throwing itself into
the Caspian Sea.      The highest point in this operation was
only  594   metres above   the Tainan Island.    In the vicinity of
Mosdoek, one of the stations, and 250 wersts from the Caspian
Sea, the plain was on the level of the Black Sea.
   This first measurement was made under very favourable cir
cumstances, and gave for the difference of level 105 metres by
which the Caspian Sea is lower than the Black Sea.
   Struck with the singularity of this result, Messrs. Parrot and
Engelhardt recommenced the operation of the 10th of October,
but proceeding on this occasion from east to west and following
the same stations, without turning towards the Caucasus.         On
the 14th of October they had already gained the mouth of the
Kubar.     The weather during this second measurement was
much less favourable, the barometer and thermometer were in
constant, the changes more sudden, the winds more variable
and of more unequal strength.      Snow also fell at various times : ,
the sky was generally stormy, cold, and rainy, circumstances
which usually render the altitudes too small. Now it is remark
able that it is in fact in this respect that the second determina
tion is erroneous, for it gives 92 metres for the elevation of the
level of the Black Sea over that of the Caspian Sea. ,
   After having thus twice traversed the great Steppe, M. Par
rot had the patience to make a third journey. He set out from
 Taman on the 24th of November, and ought to have arrived at
the mouth of the Terek on the 10th of December.            The want
of post horses produced so many delays, however, that he did
not reach the banks of the Caspian Sea until the 20th of De
cember at 15 minutes past 11 A.M. M. Engelhardt had finished
his observation on the Black Sea the night before : thus this
operation presents no corresponding observations, and may mere
ly serve as a verification.     On combining the observation of
Taman    Of the 19th at 15 minutes past 11 with the observation
made next day at the same hour in the Caspian Sea, we find 99
metres for the difference of level.     Another observation made
at Taman in the afternoon of the 19th of December gave 102
metres. On comparing the observation of M. Parrot of the 20th
with the mean of all the observations of the 19th on the Black
 Sea, we shall obtain almost the same difference.        There is in
short no barometrical observation from that of 15 minutes past
 11 made at Taman from the 11th to the 1 9th of December,
which combined with the single observation of M. Parrot of

   368              0/2 the  relative Heights      of the Levels
   the 20th of December indicates a sensible difference of level
   between the two seas : the least of these determinations will not
   be less than 4 1 metres.
      After having ascertained this grand difference of level, our
   travellers thought they should inquire if it had always existed.
   Now Pallas thought he recognised by the form of the strata and
   the shells of the Caspian Sea scattered throughout the Steppe
   the ancient shores of that sea.             The operations of Messrs.
   Parrot and Engelhardt place these shores, which have an im
   mense development, and in which we find gulfs and bays very
   clearly defined, at 234 metres above the present level ; it must
  therefore be admitted that a mass of water has been lost of about
  30,000 square sea leagues in surface and 100 metres in depth.
   M. Parrot does not think that this was by evaporation; for, ac
   cording to Gmelin, the waters of the Caspian Sea are so little
  salt that they do not contain one jourth of the muriate of soda
  which is found in those of the Atlantic Ocean : he rather thinks
  that this water must have run off by rents which have been suc
  cessively opened and closed, the bottom of the sea being agi
  tated by the volcanic action, the effects of which are still seen
  in the Island of Taman on the Bosphorus, and at Baka on the
  Caspian Sea.       The enormous differences between the soundings
  observed since 1556 and the time of Peter the Great to the pre
 sent time give some probability to this opinion *.
      Let us now refer these results to the operations of the same
 kind which have been made at different epochs in order to com
 pare the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, the Mediterranean
 with the Atlantic Ocean, and this Ocean with the South Sea.
      During the French expedition in Egypt, a. commission of
 engineers of roads and bridges was charged under the direction
 of M. le Pere to execute the levelling of the Isthmus of Suez :
 thereby they resolved the celebrated question agitated from the
 most remote antiquity, of the elevation of the Red Sea above
 the Mediterranean and the soil of Lower Egypt.                 It results, in
 fact, from the labours of the commission, that the level of the
     * On taking the mean between the results of the two measurements we
shall find 93J millimetres ( near 200 feet) tor the quantity by which ther
level of the Black Sea is more elevated than that of the Caspian Sea.
Hence it results that Astracan, the adjacent plains, and a very great num
ber of other inhabited places as well in Persia as in Russia, are much in-
fcriorto the level of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean : — the singtdarity
of this result will justify the dettiils into which we have entered. Tocou-
clude: Before the voyage of- Messrs. Parrot and Engelhardt, it had been
suspected that the two seas had always one and the same level. M. Par
rot's measurement corresponds perfectly with that given by Dr. Thos.
Young in his Natural Philosophy.        The barometrical heights of Kamychin
give for the Wolga 50» 5' of latitude, and 54j millimetres below the level
ot'St. Petersburgh.
                                                                  Mediterra-

                 of the Black   Sea and Caspian Sea.               369
Mediterranean Sea      is lower by eight millimetres     at low water
and nine millimetres at the high water of the Red Sea.            One
part of the basin of the bitter lakes is remarkable for its being
eight metres lower than the level of the Mediterranean, which
consequently places it 16 metres lower than the Red Sea: other
points of the soil and even of the inhabited places are lower than
the levels of both seas. The water of the Red Sea, for instance,
might cover the whole of the surface of the Delta, and the ter
rors of submersion were, as has been seen, natural enough at
distant periods, when this part of Egypt was less elevated than
it is at present.
   For want of observations exactly correspondent for estimating
the difference of elevations of two very distant stations, experi
mentalists have sometimes used the comparison of the barometri
cal mean pressure : this process is capable of much precision,
as M. Ramond has demonstrated, if we stop at the mean pres
sures of the same hours, in order to avoid the effects of the pe
riodical variations.     In order to determine the relative altitudes
of the levels of the South Sea and of the Atlantic Ocean, it
ought therefore to be sufficient to compare the mean heights of
the barometer over the two opposite coasts of America.              M.
Humboldt's Journal furnishes us with the necessary data for this
purpose.
    In fact, we there find in the first place that at Carthagena and
Cumana in the Gulf of Mexico, the mean pressure of the ba
rometer = 0-7620 millimetre by a temperature of 25° centi
grade.     At the harbour of Vera Cruz, the thermometer being
at 20° the height = 0-7613 millimetre, but corrected from the
dilatation of the mercury, it becomes as at Cumana 0-7620
millimetre. At the temperature of zero and at the level of the
Atlantic Ocean, between the tropics, the mean height of the ba
rometer is consequently = 0-7585 millimetre.
   On the shores of the South Sea, at Callao, a port of Lima,
M. de Humboldt found the barometer == 0-7606 millimetre,
the thermometer 20°; and at Acapulco, still on the Pacific Ocean,
the barometer = 0-7617 millimetre, the thermoa<eter               27°.
These heights brought to the temperature of zero, yield for
the mean pressure of the air at the level of the South Sea 0-7578
millimetre.     If the slight difference which we remark between
this number and that which represents the mean pressure at the
level of the Atlantic Ocean could not be attributed to the errors
inevitable in such delicate observations, it will result that the
South Sea must be higher than the Ocean by about seven metres.
Other observations of M. Humboldt which have not yet been
published, will give a difference a little greater and in the same
proportion ; but this celebrated, traveller who only used his ba-

370 Relative Heights of the Levels of Ilw Black and Caspian Seas.
 lometers for a geological level, thinks that in order completely
 to do away the doubts which the question may still present re
 specting the relative height of the two oceans, we must have
 recourse to instruments more precise, and exposed to shorter
journeys by land ; while we keep an account at the same time
 of the unequal heights of the tides, of the different hours of the
 observations in the harbours on the opposite shores of America,
  and of the horary variations of the barometer, which, although
  very regular as to the hours at which they happen, are not as
  completely so as has been supposed as to the quantities which
  measure them.     However this may be, the observations which
 we have given already prove, that if there does exist a difference
 of level between the Ocean and the Great Pacific, it must be
 very small.
    The little velocity and constancy which mariners have re
 marked in the currents of the Straits of Gibraltar, show that in
 these places the Mediterranean        and the Ocean have nearly the
 same level.    It may nevertheless appear curious to compare un
  der this point of view two very distant points, since, contrary
 to all idea, the levelling of the isthmus of Suez, the results of
 which have been given above, has proved that two seas which
  communicate with each other may, nevertheless, have very dif
 ferent levels.   Now the measurement of the meridian of France
 presents  an  uninterrupted chain of triangles, which extend from
  Dunkirk   to  Barcelona; the relative elevations of the various
 summits may be deduced from the reciprocal observations of
 distances from the zenith ; the absolute height of one single
 station will therefore serve to find the absolute height of all the
 rest ; and this will be the case, whether we set out from the
 Mediterranean to approach the Ocean, or follow a contrary di
 rection.
    It is according to this method that M. Delambre has calcu
 lated the elevation of Rhodes over the Mediterranean          and the
 Ocean, setting out in the first place from Mont Juy to Barce
 lona, of which Stephani had directly found the height; and
 secondly, by the help of a signal at Dunkirk which was only
 66 metres from the level of low water : those two determinations
 agreeing within a fraction of a metre, we may conclude, if not
 that the level of the Ocean at Dunkirk is exactly the same with
 the level of the Mediterranean at Barcelona, at least that the
 inequality of height,   if it exists, ought to be insensible.

    HiXXIV. On the Quantity of ligneous Matter which exists in
        some Roots and   Fruits.       Mead to the Philomalhic Society by
        M. Clement*.
    I  am about to communicate to the Society an observation which
    will not perhaps be without interest, because it adds something
    to our knowledge of the wonderful organization of living beings,
    and because it may not be without utility to some of the arts.
       It has been generally supposed that the ligneous matter of      f
    some roots and some fruits which serve for our nourishment, such
    as potatoes, carrots, beet-root, apples and pears, form a consi
    derable part of their mass, — a fourth or a fifth, for instance.
        The husks remaining after all the cyder has been expressed
    from the apples, and (as a celebrated chemist (M. Chaptal) has
    recently informed us) the husks of beet-root, are quite well
    adapted to the nourishment of animals.        Nevertheless it is suf
    ficient to regard the husks of beet-roots with the slightest at
    tention, to see that they are merely formed of small pieces of
    beet-root perfectly similar to those obtained by cutting and
    chipping the beet-root when whole with a very sharp instru
    ment, and without allowing a single drop of liquid to escape.
    It is impossible not to ascertain in an instant this perfect re-
,
    semblance, which strikes the eye, and which is besides confirmed
    by experience.
        I cut a piece of beet-root into thin slices, and the latter were
    tlivided and hacked nearly to the same degree with the husks
    remaining after the manufacture of sugar, and which yielded
    66 per cent, of juice. Nevertheless the beet-root thus cut did
    •not furnish any liquid on being pressed; and after being dried in
    the sun it was found to have lost 88 per cent. of its weight, i.e.
    precisely as much as the husks dried in the same way.
        Thus it is a great and mischievous error to imagine that the
    mask of beet-roots thrown away in the fabrication of sugar is a
    .substance almost dry: it contains as much water as the entire
    beet-root (as comparative desiccation proves), and as much
    sugar as the first juice extracts ; a greater mechanical division
    throws the whole into the liquid state.        We might therefore,
    in the case in which the manufacture of beet-root sugar is con
    venient, seek with a certainty of success for the means of em
    ploying in the production of sugar that considerable portion of
    the root which forms about one-third of         it,
                                                    and which has been
    supposed    so erroneously to be almost entirely composed of dry
    substances.

    What     has just been said is applicable to all the fruits em
 ployed   in  making cider : what has been regarded as husks, as re
 fuse   and  waste,  is as nearly as possible the same substance with
 the cider itself.
    But according to this, the ligneoas part which serves for an
 envelope or support to the liquid part of the fruits or roots which
 I have mentioned, will be in an excessively small quantity, since
 mechanical division will be sufficient to make it disappear, by
 causing it to float in the liquid.
    In fact, this is what I have confirmed by experiments.        I took
 off the skin from potatoes and rasped them : I washed the pulp
in a sieve in order to remove the fecula ; I took the husks which I
put in hot water, and I addded -j-^dth of sulphuric acid, in order
to liquefy the starch that resulted from the boiling of the feeula
which remained in the husks.            I filtered, after boiling some
hours ; and I found on the filtering paper, of dry ligneous mat
ter, only three-fourths of a hundredth part of the weight of the
potatoes.       I had besides ascertained that the fecula when first
separated from the husks, did not contain an atom of ligneous
matter; it had formed with the acidulated boiling water a so
lution perfectly limpid.
    I  ascertained by other experiments, that the skin of common
sized potatoes in one hundred parts formed only half a part of
their weight.
    Thus the potatoe presents the singular           phaenomenon of a
very    hard  and  very compact   solid body,  and  which contains only
one part and a fourth in one hundred parts of ligneous matter,
having when insulated by itself the solid appearance ; whereas
all the rest is formed merely of starch in powder, without any
adhesion, and more than -i^dths of liquid.
    Apples, pears, beet-root, carrots, and many other roots or
fruits exhibit also results the more astonishing, since we do not
even find in them -,-J-ydth of ligneous matter employed in forming
the membranes and vessels of those organic beings, and of which
T-y-iidths are in the liquid state.

                     1,
    The engine itself      made of wood or metal
                               is                            and to have an

accurate conception of its form,       we   have only to imagine        drum a
turned sideways, and in this situation to be supported                     fewa
inches from the ground               by
                                  being connected at each end with a
supporter, through the means of             pivot proceeding from the
                                                    a
centre of the parchment ends, so as to fit into               corresponding
                                                                    a
hole in the supporter.        In this situation by the help of a single
lever it   is made to turn to and fro in the segment of a circle.
 From the top of the vessel placed in this lateral position there
 descends about two-thirds the depth of the machine                  partition
                                                                         a
 board, c
        c,     which being firmly attached to each of the ends as
 Well as to the top, and in this way made air-tight, serves to                         di
vide the interior into two compartments.              At each end near the
 top there are two valves, one on each side of the partition board.
 At one end they open outwards, and at the other inwards, con
 sequently the use of each set of valves             different.
                                                          is        The lower
 part of the vessel     occupied
                          is             water, which
                                               by             rriade to rise
                                                                    is                  a
 little above the bottom of the partition board.
     Having given this explanation of the construction of the vessel,
 we have now to enter into the description of its operation. —
 Having said that the machine, when in action, moves to and fro
 in the segment of        circle,
                           a            quite evident, whichever way
                                          it   is                                       it
 turns, that the water will always remain at. whatever part comes
 to be the bottom.      The vessel       fact will move round the water.
                                               in
 Such being     the case,  to  whichever    side the vessel moves, or in
  other words, whichever of the two compartments comes to be
 lowest,;  it   ismanifest, that the air included in that compart
  ment will be powerfully compressed                     by
                                                   the partition board de
  scending towards the fixed body of water, and will be forced with
  a blast proportionate to the weight of water through the valve
  intoa   pipe.    Upon the re-ascent of this compartment the same
  operation will take place in the other, while at the same time
  the air will again rush into the former                 by
                                                      the valve opening in
  wards.     In this way,           by
                                the rotation of the engine to and fro,
  the air will be alternately discharged from each compartment,
  and a    vigorous and almost constant blast will be maintained.
I    say almost   constant, for while the vessel        in the act of turning
                                                               is
  after the expulsion of the air from the compartment,                      ob

machinery are so contrived to work, that at the moment when
the one is at the poise, or in the act of recovering itself after the
 expulsion of the air, the other shall be in the full energy of its
 operation.     It is thus by the double blowing machine that a
 powerful and incessant blast is maintained.
    The advantages of this machine in point of power, the saving
of fuel and labour, and in the more complete and speedy re-*
duction of the ore, are such, that it is found incomparably su
 perior to the usual method of exciting an intense heat, and it is
now coining into general use.          Indeed its adoption is a matter
of course; for it appears from the report of those who have tried
it, that the manufacturer is enabled to work 40 per cent. cheaper
 than he can without it.       The prodigious strength of the blast,
and the rapidity with which the metal is reduced, are perfectly
astonishing to the founder in his first experiment with it.              I
have seen several letters which Mr. Street has received from
different manufacturers who have used                    it,
                                                   and from the lowest

be fused       the same period
                in                  of  time.    One founder computes
that he can with one horse melt more metal in eight .hours, than
he could do before with three horses in twelve hours. In fact, no
thing can be stronger and mofe decisive as to its advantages, than
the testimonials which have been received from all quarters; and
perhaps     itmay not be too much to say, that            discovery more

LXXVI.       On the refractive and dispersive Powers of certain
    Liquids, and of the Fapours which they form. By Messrs.
   Arago and Petit.
Read before the Royal Institute       of France   11 th of December
                                 1815.
The      theory of refraction, when considered under the most
general point of view, is one of the most important branches
of optics, not only on account of its numerous applications,
but also from the consequences which may be deduced from it
relative to the nature of light and to the true causes of its pro
perties.     Thus the experimentalists who have developed or
supported the various systems contrived for the explanation of
the phaenomena of optics, are always particularly anxious to
model the law of refraction according to the hypothesis which
they admit.
    Newton, in attributing refraction to an attraction of bodies for
light, has given of this phaenomenon, and of the law to which it
is subjected, an explanation so clear and natural, that it has been
always regarded as one of the principal arguments in favour of
the system of emission.      Nevertheless, if we remark that of all
the general consequences deduced from the hypothesis of New
ton, the only one which to this day has been verified is reduced
to the law of the constant ratio of the sine of incidence and of
refraction ; if we observe besides that this law may be demon
strated without its being necessary to have recourse to the idea of
an attraction, we shall easily perceive that before determining
to adopt the hypothesis of Newton to the exclusion of all others,
it is indispensable to examine to what extent the various con
clusions which flow from it are confirmed by experience : — such
is the object of our present researches.     In order to know their
object correctly, it   will be  necessary to  retrace in few words
the principal pomts of the theory of refraction, such as Newton
has inferred from the supposition of an attraction exercised by
bodies upon light.
    On this hypothesis, we may easily conceive that when the
molecules of which a ray is composed approach the refracting
body, the attraction which it exercises on them changes botft
their velocity and the direction of their motion, and that this mo-,
tion becomes once more uniform and rectilinear, when the mo
lecule* have penetrated into the body to the depth where the at
traction ceases to be sensible.       The principle of active forces
applicable in this case, proves that the velocity which the light
ha3 acquired by the effect of refraction, is independent           of
the initial direction of the ray, and that the ratio of this ve-
                                 A a4                          Iocity

376          On the refractive and dispersive Powers        of
locity to that of the incident light is equal to the ratio from the
sine of incidence to the sine of refraction.
    The same principle of active forces gives as the measurement
of the total action of the body upon light, the increment of the
square of the velocity of the ray ; an increment which for this
reason has been designated by the name of refractive power.
This quantity ought evidently to depend on the nature of the
body; but in one and the- same substance it should remain in
a proportion to the density, for it is natural to suppose that an
attraction is always exercised in proportion to the'mass, what
ever: in other respects may be the function of the distance ac
cording to which it varies.        On this supposition, the refringent
power,    i. e.  the ratio  of the  refractive power with the density,
ought    no  longer to depend on any thing but the chemical con
stitution of the body, and remain constant when the density
alone changes.
    This consequence of the theory of attraction has never been
verified except, in the gases.        But if we reflect that their re
fractive power is extremely weak, and that consequently the in
 crement of velocity which they impress on the light is very small,
we shall be convinced, by the help of a very simple calculation,
that the expression which the Newtonian theory gives for the re
fractive power is not the only one which, in the gases, remains
in proportion to the density ; but that there exists an infinity of
expressions different from the latter, all of which will satisfy the
same condition.        It results therefore, that, so far from the gases
appearing to have a refracting power independent of their den
sity, we have no right to conclude that solid and liquid bodies
possess the same property.
    We are of opinion that the best method of deciding com
pletely this question, will be to compare the refractive power of
different liquids, with that of the vapours which these liquids
form. In this case the change of density is very considerable,
and one of the bodies at least preserves a very strong action on
the light.      We have therefore made choice of liquids, which at
the ordinary temperatures of the air furnish the most abundant
vapours.      We have measured the refractive power of each of
these liquids and that of the vapours which come from them : by
comparing those refractive powers with the known densities of
the liquids and of the vapours, it was easy to see if in each of
these bodies the refracting power, i. e. the analytical expression
    2
 *'      was independent of the density.

    The result of our experiments proves rigorously the con
trary.    They all agree in giving for the vapours a refracting
                                                                  power

       tsrlain Liquids, and of the Vapours which they form.        3/7
power     sensibly less than that of the liquids which have formed
them. Thus, in order to cite but a single example, the refracting
power of the liquid carburetted sulphur, with reference to that
of the air, is a little more than three, whereas that of the same
substance in the state of vapour, with the same reference, does
not exceed two.
    If we now compare this result with the theory, we shall be obliged,
bv admitting the Newtonian theory of refraction, to suppose, which
is at least a singular conclusion, that the attraction of one and
the same body for the light is not exerted in proportion to the
density.      Unfortunately, the number of the substances on whTch
 we may operate with precision in the state of vapour, is too
 small to entitle us to hope to deduce from the results of our ex
 periments, any law relative to the variation which the change of
density occasions to the affinity of bodies for light.     The liquids
which we tried      were  carburetted  sulphur, sulphuric ether, and
 muriatic ether.
     In the absence of this direct method, it appeared to us that
 this law might be deduced from the comparison of the refracting
 power of the gases, and of that of the solid or liquid bodies:
 which they form on being united.         In fact, if in the combina
 tions of gas which retain the gaseous state, the refracting power
 of the compound was, as has been hitherto supposed, equal t,o
the sum of the refracting powers of its elements, it will thence
 result that the act of combination will not in anyway modify the
 notion of bodies on light. Hence we may conclude with proba
 bility, that the refracting power of a solid or liquid compound
 differs from the sum of #he refracting powers of its gaseous
 principles, only in the ratio of the augmentation which these
 last undergo by the effect of condensation.
      Nevertheless, as the law relative to.the refracting power of the
  compound gases had been founded but upon a small number of"
 experiments, it was indispensable in the first place to ascertain
 its exactitude : now by the measurements which we have made of
 the refraction of a great number of gases, we have proved that
this law has not always agreed with the results of observation.
     We see therefore that the refracting power of any body, far
 from being constant, as the Newtonian theory seemed to prove,
 on the must natural hypothesis which can le formed of attrac
 tion, undergoes on the contrary variations, either by the effect
 of the change of density, or by the state of combination in which
 the body is found.      In order to determine the influence of each
 of those causes in particular, it is necessary to measure with ex
 actitude the refracting powers of a great number of substances,
 and those of the combinations to which they give rise. Although
 the labour which we have undertaken on this head already em
                                                                 braces

 878 On the refractive and dispersive Powers        of certain Liquids.
   braces a considerable number of bodies, we have felt the ne
   cessity of extending our experiments still further, in order to en
   deavour to connect by some general law the various results which
   we obtained.
       The facts which we have presented appeared to us to be ot
   such importance relative to the theory of light, that we have
   thought it would be useful to follow the consequences of it into
   the various phaenomena which by their nature have a more or
   less direct union with that of refraction.
      The variously coloured rays of which white light is composed
   tie, as we know, unequally separated from each other by their re-
   refraction into bodies of a different nature, and in this consists the
   difference of dispersive power of bodies.       What is most natural
  to take for the measurement of the dispersive power, is the dif
  ference of the refracting powers relative to the extreme colours
  of the spectrum ; and in the Newtonian theory this difference
   tught to be constant for one and the same body, as well as the
  refracting power of the mean rays.
      Experience having shown that this last power diminished with
  the density, it was easy to foresee that the dispersive power
  would also diminish ; but it was important to examine if these
  variations followed the same law.       In order to attain this object,
  it was necessary to determine the dispersive power of the liquids
  sad vapours of which we had previously measured the refrac
  ting power.      The dispersive power of the liquids may be easily
. obtained, but it is not the same with that of the vapours.         The
  refraction which they occasion in a prism being very weak, the
  dispersion, which is only a very small part of this refraction, is
  scarcely sensible.     Thus, in spite of the importance of a similar
  determination     either in the gases or in the vapours, experi
  mentalists seem to have given up the idea of deducing it from
  observation.      But as the object which we proposed to ourselves
  required a direct measurement, we were constrained to attaia
  this object by the aid of a process of which we shall give a de
  tailed description. We shall find besides, from the results which
  we shall give, that the experiments made on one and the same
  vapour under different circumstances, agree well enough with
  each other to entitle us to regard our determinations as*fclose'y
  approaching the truth.
      On comparing the dispersive powers of the vapours thus mea
  sured, with those of the liquid from which these vapours have pro
  ceeded, we were convinced that the dispersive power was effectu
  ally diminished with the density ; but what observation has taught
 Us, in a manner not less certain,   is,  that the dispersive power  di
 minishes in   a greater ratio than the refracting power ;    or in other
  words,  by   calling
                   i     the ratio of the  sine of  incidence to the sine

         On the Use of Sulphate      of Soda in  the making   of Glats. '379
   of refraction, and d the density of the body, the refracting
   power       1—1   is  not only variable  for one and the same class of
                d
   rays, but also the law according to which this change is effected
   is different for the variously coloured rays.
         In the carburetted sulphur which we have already chosen for
   example, the ratio of the dispersive power to the refracting power
   is 0-14 in the liquid state, whereas it is reduced to 0*88 in the
   State of vapour.
         Thus, while the variation of the refracting power may be also
    accounted for, by admitting that the attraction of one and the
    same body for light varies according to a law different from that
    of the direct ratio of the densities, we see that in order to give
    an account of the variation observed in the dispersive power, we
    must suppose besides that the action of a body on the various
    coloured rays follows in the changes of density a different law
   for each of those rays.          These various suppositions        diminish,
    without doubt, both the simplicity and the probability of the
    Newtonian theory ; but before deciding any thing in this respect,
 '
    it is necessary, we repeat, to examine with great care the changes
    which the refracting powers of bodies undergo, either by
'
    variations of density or by the effect of combination.             It is in
    dispensable     also   to join to these  determinations    such  as  are"*re-
    lative to the dispersive powers,        to  which  experimentalists have
    not hitherto paid any attention, and which, as we have already
     announced, may by means of numerous precautions be deduced
     from direct experiments. 1
         Although the work which we purpose to publish on this sub
    ject be very far advanced, we have thought it right to communi
     cate beforehand the results furnished to us by our experiments on
     liquids and vapours.
       LXXVII.      On the Use     of Sulphate of Soda in      the making     of
                        Glass.    By the late M, Gjehlen*.
     M     . Gehlen,      of whose valuable services chemistry has lately
     been deprived by a premature death, was much occupied with
     the manufacture of glass, and employed the sulphate of soda as.
      a flux.   It is not the salt which is vitrified with the silexj but
     rather the soda, which abandons the sulphuric acid at a high
     temperature, on account of the ehemical action which soda and
      silex exercise upon each other.         After a great number of ex-

 380                Some Account      of the Monuments
 periments, M. Gehlen found that the following proportions were"
 the best :
     100 sand, 50 dry sulphate of soda, from 17 to 20 of quick
lime in dry powder, and 4 of charcoal.
     This composition always gives, without the addition of any
 other flux, a very fine glass for drinking-glasses ; and we remark
 neither any sulphurous smell, which was sometimes so strong as
 to overpower the workmen, nor the extraordinary crackling
 which is manifested in the melting-pots when other proportions
 are employed.
     After numerous observations M. Gehlen announces the follow
 ing results :
      1. The sulphate of soda maybe employed in the manu
  facture of glass, without the addition of any other saline flux.
 The glass, which results is equally beautiful with that made with'
  the usual materials, and it possesses all the properties of that
  made with soda.
     2. The sulphate of soda alone, is but very imperfectly vitrified
  with the silex, even when heat is long continued.                      By the
  intermedium of lime, the vitrification succeeds better, but not
  in the proportion of the lime and the combustibles which must
  be employed.
     3. The vitrification takes place^ on the contrary, in a short
 -time and in a perfect manner, by means of any substance which
  decomposes the sulphuric acid of the sulphate of soda, and thus
  destroys the powerful affinity which hindered the soda from
  acting on the silex.      It is charcoal which best attains this ob
 ject: nevertheless     in the  preparation of flint glass its place may
  be supplied by metallic lead.
     4. This decomposition of the sulphate of soda may be effected
  during the vitrification itself, or previous.          Local circumstances
  may determine, in the choice of one orother of those processes ;
  but the employment of the latter presents no difficulty what
  ever.

  KJwr.    knowledge of the monuments of Thebes was, until lately,

the upper part, where they have but very rarely had opportuni
ties of making extensive researches, and more rarely still leisure
and talents for transmitting to us by faithful drawings what they
had seen.   Of all those travellers, Pocock and Norden are al
most the only ones who deserve to be mentioned.        But in the
present day the slightest examination is sufficient to show how
inadequate they are to give an accurate idea of the monuments
of this country: — thus their reports furnish not the slightest idea
 of those wonders of antiquity with which we have been since
made acquainted.           It was the French expedition to Egypt
which revealed to us the secrets of that country.           M. Denon, by
his Voyage and the engravings which accompanied              it,  was the
first who gave   a    more precise idea of the monuments of Upper
 Egypt, and partly of those of Thebes*. This work fixed the at
tention of Europe on the country, and gave hopes of making
further discoveries.        The reports of M. Denon, however, only
excited without satisfying our curiosity.

                                 by
to his researches.
    The French government has already commenced the publica
tion of a superb work upon Egypt ancient as well as modern,
its monuments, productions, inhabitants, &c.              The first num
ber appeared in' 1811.           comprehends Upper Egypt, from.tlre

SS2                Some Account    of ike Monuments
(iottingen library, we received that of Sir William Hamilton
also, whom I had the honour to reckon among my auditors
during a course of lectures which I gave on the antiquities of
Egypt. The English traveller has dedicated the first part of
his work to the monuments of this country, and particularly to
those of Upper Egypt and of Thebes.            It is true that we find
here a sketch of several of the drawings of the great French
work, and every person must be aware of the advantage which
results from the comparison of the descriptions and criticisms,
and even of the drawings of observers of two different nations,
who furnish us with means of comparison so useful and im
portant.
    It is from those    two  sources,  but chiefly  the former,   that
I have drawn my materials. I shall endeavour, in the first place,
to give   a general idea   of the monuments of Thebes, and to      de
scribe them afterwards in detail.
    The French have measured the ground of ancient Thebes,
and have given it in the Plan General with an exactitude which
leaves almost nothing to be desired.       The valley of the Nile did
not present in all Upper Egypt any place more convenient for the
establishment of a great capital.       The chains of mountains of
the two shores of the river, those of Libya on the west and
the Arabic on the east, are far enough distant to leave on the
two banks a spacious plain from three leagues to three and a
fcalf broad from west to east, and nearly of the same length. To
the north this plain is very contracted, by the closeness of the
mountains which skirt the banks ; but towards the south, where
the western chain leaves the river, it is open on one side.
Nature had therefore put bounds to the space which Thebes oc
cupied, but still there was space enough to make it one of the
first cities of the earth.   Did the ancient Thebes cover the whole
of this plain ? This is a question which it is difficult to decide,
after all the private residences have disappeared; but as on the
western side the external monuments extend to the foot of the
mountains of Libya (where the Hypogsea or subterranean monu
ments commence) , the circumstance does not appear doubtful in
this part : as to the western side, where the great monuments
are immediately close to the river, it cannot be determined to
what extern this vast plain was covered with habitations.         His
tory teaches us to think that it was entirely so, from the extent
of its population/
    Thebes extended therefore over both banks of the Nile ; but,
so far as we know, the two parts of the city were never joined
by a bridge.      A nation which was not acquainted with the art
of making arches, could scarcely throw a bridge- pver a riVe-r.
which is from 7 to 800 fathoms in breadth.

     The sketch which we are now about to give of the monuments
still existing, will be more intelligible if we distinguish them by
 the two sides of the river.          The principal of those fine ruins
bear the names of villages with which the plain is covered : ok
the west bank are those of Medynat-Abou and Kurnu ; Luxe;-
 and Carnoc are on the opposite shore; and we must add Med-
Amuth, situated at the north-east extremity of the valley, and
presenting the most distant ruins. As to the size of those monu
ments, they resemble each other so much on both banks, that
opinions are divided as to the preference which ought to be given
 to either.
 I. Monuments which          exist in the ivestern    Part of the Plain of
                                    Thebes.
    The monuments of this part of the plain are of 'different
kinds. They form an uninterrupted series from south to north
near the Libyan chain : there remains therefore between the
monuments and the river a spacious plain, which must have been
covered formerly with private residences.                 In contemplating
 ihem we shall go from south to north.
                     1.  The Circus or Hippodrome*.
     The first objects which here present themselves are the remains
«f grand Stadium with a small temple at the southern extremity ;
    a
 but the grand portico which we see on one side of this temple
inclines us to think that there existed there in ancient times an
edifice proportioned to those dimensions.              The Circus is more
than 6000 French feet long by 3000 broad. By the report of
the French, the area which it presents is equal to that of the
Champ de Mars at Paris taken seven times, or 624,380 squaie
toises or fathoms : it presented therefore a space sufficient for
the evolutions of an immense army.             The whole had an inclosuic
which to this day presents a series of hillocks, through which doon
and passages were made : 39 of these are still reckoned,                 and
 there must have been formerly nearly 50,               The principal en
trance,    indicated    by a larger aperture,     was    on the east side     ;
    * Sir W. Hamilton,
                         p. 151, denies the existence of this Circus. He sees
in it merely the lied of an ancient canal, also marked by the French. .This
 space, which he values at 2000 yards in length by 40 in breadth, cannot,
he says, have served for a stadium.      Nevertheless the accurate researches
and the measurements of the French leave no doubt as to the data of their
test; and I can only account for the errors of tW English author, by Sup
posing 'hat the inundations, which still continued, prevented him from vi
siting the spot completely; or, rather, Has Sir W. Hamilton taken the dou
ble inclosure of the eastern side, which leaves a space of 40 yards, for the
general inclosure of the Circus?    This error would be the more easily fallen
into, as the inclosure of the eastern side now exists only in ruins.

3S4                   Some Account   of   the Monuments
the   w hole inclosure shows evidently that it was formerly adorned
with superb architecture, which contained triumphal monuments*
 It is probable that this grand circus was not within the inclosure
 of the city, although quite close to Thebes : there was a similar
 Circus, but smaller, on the eastern side, almost opposite the first.
 If we allow that both were outside of the city, we may also de
 termine with great probability the southern front of Thebes.
 It is not credible that those two establishments were destined to
 the gymnastic exercises solely and to chariot-racirg;           they were
 used apparently also for public meetings, and for the exercise of
 those armies which under the Scsostris, the Osymandyas and
 other conquerors, set out from thence for their eonquests, and
 bronght home there the triumphal marks of their victories.
    II. On going further northward, we meet, on the edge of this
-sandy belt which extends along the Libyan chain, the antiquities
 of Medynat-Abou.         I comprise under this name, proceeding
 from south to north ;
    a. A palace and a temple almost at the northern extremity of
the Circus.
    b. The Colossus of Memnon, with the other Colossi quite
 near, and the remains of a building which seems to be the Mem-
 nonium of Strabo.
    c. The palace and tomb of Osymandyas,              frequently called
 Memnonium by travellers.
    All these monuments are almost at the foot of the Libyan
chain, and 1500 toises from the hill.
    We shall in the first instance take up the subject of the palace,
 the pavilion which communicates with          it,and the temple.     It   is
a   matter of great historical importance to meet with these
edifices, the interior arrangement of which proves in an incon
testable manner that they were not temples properly so called,
but buildings destined to be inhabited, and probably             by kings.
The pavilion     is  building
                      a         of two  stories ;     has
                                                     it     several   halls
and chambers, and a great number of windows.               Its position is
so well adapted, that from this point we perceive not only the
monuments of Medynat-Abou, but also those of the other side
of the Nile and the whole plain of Thebes.            Every thing there
seems to indicate the ordinary residences of kings          :   the orna
ments of the sides    in  particular confirm   this hypothesis.     These
representations differ essentially from those which are found in
the temples  :   they exhibit in part family scenes.      Unfortunately
this edifice is  very much    damaged,    and   the  upper   story only is
preserved.
    Itis' 250 feet north-west from this pavilion that the grand
palace of Medynat-Abou       to be found.
                              is           Its entrance  formed is
by those masses of architecture, foreign to the European style
                                                                       is it

is true, but knotvn in      France by the name of Py tones, and which
the Greeks       also called Propylece.         There are here also two
truncated pyramids 66 feet high, which contain between them the
principal gate and grand entrance.           This gate leads into a spa
cious court surrounded by galleries, formed on one side by eight
columns, on the other by pilasters, on which are affixed as
caryatides, but without bearing any thing, some colossal statues
of Osiris. The aspect of the whole inspires, according to the
report of eye-witnesses, a sentiment of ineffable veneration.'
Opposite to the principal entrance rises a second pylone of a
smaller size.       It leads into a second peristyle, also formed of
caryatides, pilasters, and columns.

                               To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir, —      On     examining lately, some very curious and elaborate
Tables of     "  Complete decimal Quotients," calculated by Henry
Goodwyn, Esq. of Blackheath, of which he has printed a copious
specimen, for private circulation among curious and practical
calculators, preparatory to the printing of the whole of these
useful Tables, if sufficient encouragement, either public or indi
vidual, should appear to warrant such a step : I was fortunate
while so doing, to deduce from them the following general pro
perty   ;  viz.
    If all the possible vulgar fractions      of different values, whose
greatest   denominator     (when  in their lowest   terms) does not exceed
any given number, be arranged in the order of their values, or
quotients ; then if both the numerator and the denominator of any
fraction therein, be added to the numerator and the denominator,
respectively, of the fraction next but one to it (on either side),
the sums will give the fraction next to it ; although, perhaps,
not in its lowest terms.
  For example, if 5 be the greatest denominator given; then are all
the possible fractions,     when arranged,           --,   -, y,   ~,  y,

y-^j      =   g-
                 =   —   the   next    smaller   fraction,   then   yj   or,
          —  y,   the next larger fraction     to  ~.     Again,  if 99 be

the largest denominator,        then, in a part of the arranged Table,
we should have               —,             ii,  &c. ; and  if  the third
of these fractions      be given,  we have   4r1"4r — "^ tne      sec01"' :

     I am not acquainted, whether this curious property of vulgar
 fractions has been before pointed out ? ; or whether it may ad
mit of any easy or general demonstration ? ; which are points on
 which I should be glad to learn the sentiments of some of your
 mathematical readers; and am

 tended to be temporary, not merely the operations of the Tri

 have been regularly carried on during that period, under the

  will be ready for delivery almost immediately.           The maps of
  Cornwall, Devonshire, Dorsetshire, Hampshire, (including the

    May 2.   D   u. Nixon communicated an account by Dr. Serres
of a singular case of complete euphony cured by electricity.
The subject was a young French officer, who at the battle of
Dresden was in the act of giving the word of command, when a
ball passed him, the effect of which on the air knocked him
down, at the same time rendering him speechless, and for a day
almost insensible.     Two men near him were killed by the ball,
which did not touch him.         In the hospital at Dresden he par
tially recovered the use of his left side and hearing, which were
impaired ; but all efforts to recover his voice were in vain, and
 he was discharged as an invalid.         His hearing was still very
confused, but his smell was preternaturally          acute, and the
smell of coffee was altogether intolerable to him.         His tongue
had contracted into a small protuberance in his mouth about
the compass of an inch, and his left side continued benumbed,
till he was prevailed on to be electrified by Mr. Tinman of
Brussels.     He had not been electrified above seven or eight times
when his hearing was improved, and his tongue began to ex
pand. Mr. T. then passed shocks through his mouth and down to
his stomach, when he hastily got up, and in a low voice returned
 thanks to the operator, and ran off to Amsterdam like a person
deranged.      He returned, however, in a few days perfectly cured
in his voice, which is now better than it was before the accident;
but he still feels some pain in his left leg, and occasionally in
foggy weather an oppression on the chest.           But after eight
 months and twenty-five days he recovered his voice completely.
    Dr. Wollaston read a paper, containing his remarks on the
glazier's diamond, and an account of his experiments with that
instrument.      He discovered that the diamonds for cutting glass
 are all in a natural state, and not cut by the lapidaries ; that the
natural angles of the stones are probably harder than the artifi
 cial ; that the surface of all cutting diamonds is curvilinear ; that
 the groove which they make (for it is not a scratch as com
monly supposed) on the surface of the glass is a tangent to the
face of the diamond ; and that flint and other hard stones may

     May 9. A letter to the President by                Chapman, Esq.
  M.R.I. A. was read, detailing some observations and conjectures
  on the geological formation of coals.     The author had reason to
  suppose that coals were formed from peat; and to illustrate this
  opinion he has observed the depth of peat bogs in Ireland, and
  in the north of England, and compared the results with the
  coal-mines at Newcastle, whence he writes.         The deepest peat
  bogs are from 30 to 40 feet ; and he finds by calculation that if
  this mass was compressed, it would be about equal to the strata
  of coal at Newcastle, although it is far from equalling those in
  Staffordshire.    He also traced the analogy between the timber
  or trees fotfnd in peat-bogs and on the sea-shores of Northum
  berland, and the gritstone found in the Canton mine at New
  castle.   This stone, specimens of which have been sent to the
  British Museum, has the perfect form and appearance of trees ;
  and even its apparent fibres are such as to leave no doubt of the
 kind of wood which had preceded the present sand or grit. It
 appears that this ligniform stone fell from the roof of the pit,
 and had been in an erect position, the same as trees are often
 found in peat-bogs in the natural mode of growth.           In falling,
 these stones leave behind them the model of their bark, which
 the author thinks has been converted into canal coal.          He also
 took the specific gravity of peat, which he found to be^in genera!
 1200, and noticed the peculiar oval form into which trees are
 compressed in the earth.        The combustion which assisted fhe
 change of peat into coal, he considers, may have been effected
 by means of the martial pyrites.
    May 16.      A letter from Mr. Mornley to Dr. Wollaston was
 read, describing an immense block of meteoric iron found in
Brazil, about 50 leagues from Bahia. This extraordinary mass
was discovered near the bed of a river, in a sterile country, where
the granite rocks occasionally surmount, and are never more than
twelve feet below the surface of the soil ; there are few trees, and
those stunted; and hedges are formed of a species of euphorbia,
the juice of which emits a phosphorescent light, and is highlv
deleterious to the skins of animals.         The block of meteoric
iron measured about 6 feet by 4, and the author calculated that
it contained 28 cubic feet, and weighed 14,000 lbs. An unsuc
cessful attempt was made about thirty years ago to transport it to
Bahia, and for this purpose forty pair of oxen were employed ;
but the apparatus failed, and the attempt was' abandoned.             It
was removed only     some  yards, and now  lies in lat. 10° 33'  south.
There are thermal springs in that country, the temperature of
which was from 81 to 101, the atmosphere being 77 and 88;

    the water contains           iron, is bitter, and clear.       Common salt
     abounds, and is collected by the inhabitants ; but it is bitter,
     and purgative to those unaccustomed to its use.               Dr. Wollaston
     analysed the specimen which the author succeeded in chiseling
     from the block, which he found to be magnetic.                   In Dr. W's
     analysis    he  found   it to  contain about 4 per    cent, of nickel ; the
     mineral is crystallized ; he dissolved it in nitric ae:d, added am
     monia, and precipitated it with a triple prussiat.            The specirae.ii
    given to Dr. W. he found to be susceptible of magnetism, like all
    native iron ore ; he therefore confirms the author's observations
    on the magnetism of the entire block, which does not at present
     lie in the direction of its poles.
         May 23. A letter to the President from T. A. Knight, Esq.
    F.R.S. was read, containing his observations on ice found in the
    bottom of running water.             Last February Mr. K. observed near
    his residence, that ice was attached to stones at the bottom of a
    river, while the surface was only covered with innumerable spi
    cules, but not converted into solid ice.            lie likewise found ice
    below water near a mill, where the water had been precipitated
    over stones ; from tlie circumstance of the water having spicules
    running on its surface, and its temperature being quite as low
    as the freezing point, he is inclined to think that these spiculae
    have been carried to the bottom by eddies and water-falls, and
    that coming in contact with certain stones somewhat cooler than
    the water, in this manner solid ice was formed at the bottom of
    rivers.    If,   however, ice has been found at the bottom of stag
    nant water, he admitted that this theory would be inadequate to
    explain the phenomenon.              Of the latter circumstance, indeed,
    he appeared to have no perfect knowledge.
         Sir Everard Home, Bart. furnished           curious paper on the forT

  The length of the gut and its fat, Sir E. thinks, supply the want
 of yolk in the ova.    Mr. Hatchet's experiments on ova presented
 some curious facts ; he found the yolk to consist of oil and a
 peculiar animal matter.       In some cases the animal matter, was
 of a yellow colour indestructible by alkalies, and might be used
 for marking linen ; the gelatinous mass is of a nature between
 albumen and gelatin.

     Ventilation of Mines. — On      Wednesday the 23d instant the
 Societv of Arts voted their gold medal and a reward of \Q0l. to
 Mr. Ryan, for his improved system for ventilating mines. This
 is the highest" honour and pecuniary reward which the Society
 can bestow upon an individual, and strongly marks the high
 sense they entertain of the benefits likely to result from the ge
 neral introduction of this system into all the coal-mines.       Pre
judice, ignorance, and mistaken interest, must fall before the light
 of science and the calls of humanity.         The original object of
 Mr. Ryan was the prevention of explosions in coal-mines, and
 the preservation of the health of miners.         The safe-lamp of Sir
 H. Davy has effectually accomplished the first — the system of
 Mr. Ryan accomplishes the second; with this additional ad
vantage to coal owners, that they may now work out the entire
bed of coal, and not leave behind them about one half as pillars
to support the roof: and this will yield another benefit — the
roof and floor being allowed to close, the cavity will be so much
 diminished as not to form a reservoir for water, threatening the
 drowning of neighbouring mines, with the death of all the work
men, as was the case some months ago in the Heaton Colliery.

     M. Gay Lussac has also presented to the class some papers on
 the cold which results from evaporation, and on evaporation- in
 the air at different degrees of temperature and pressure, in which
 he expresses, by a formula, the results of his experiments.        He
 followed up his last paper with one on hydrometers, which con
 tains the immediate consequences of the foregoing memoirs; but
 these works not having, as he thinks, as yet acquired that preci
 sion and order which he has been accustomed to give to all that
 he publishes, he has deferred their publication.
                                                             M. Dulong

    M. Dulong of Alfort has detailed some experiments on the
oxalic acid, which, although they do not form a complete series,
nevertheless hold out some interesting prospects in science. On
saturating this acid with barytes, strontian, or lime, salts are ob
tained which always represent the acid employed, even after they
have been exposed to a heat superior to that of boiling water ; but
with oxide of lead or zinc we always lose twenty per cent. of the
acid by desiccation. On burning these dried metallic oxalates af
terwards, no water is obtained ; but we obtain carbonic acid, gase<-
ous oxide of carbon, and there remain the oxides of the metals
employed, among which that of lead presents peculiar properties.
The oxalates of copper, silver, and mercury, always give, on
the contrarv, water on decomposition, however much dried, at
the same time with carbonic acid, and the residue is in the metal
lic state. A detonation is produced by the oxalate of silver,
and we know besides that it detonates on being compressed, as
well as the oxalates of mercury.
    As to the oxalates of barytes, strontian, and lime, they give
on being decomposed by heat, empyreumatic oil, water, oxide of
carbon, carbonated hydrogen, and carbonic acid, and there re
mains a mixture of subcarbonate and charcoal.
    These phenomena may be accounted for in two ways :
    Either the oxalic acid must be composed solely of carbon and
oxygen, in proportions intermediate between those of the carbo
nic acid and the oxide of carbon ; but it contains water, which
certain oxalates, like those of lead and zinc, give off when dried,
while the rest retain it; or rather it must be composed of car
bonic acid and hydrogen.       This last with the oxygen of the
oxide will form water, which the first oxalates allow to escape, and
there will only remain the carbonic acid and the metal, a new com
bination in chemistry; for it has been generally understood that
the metals cannot be united with the acids until they are oxi
dated.    M. Dulong, who inclines towards this last explanation,
therefore, thinks that these oxalates of lead and of zinc, when
 dried, are not true oxalates; and he proposes to give them, as
well as to any combinations of the same kind which may be dis
covered, the name of carbonides.       As to the oxalates which do
not give off water in drying, they will contain the oxalic acid
entire ; and as after its composition it will in future be called
hydrocarbonic,    the salts themselves will be called hydrocar-
bonales.
    M. Dulong has been led by analogy to very general conclu
sions, by which he brings under the same laws not only the com
mon acids, but also the hydracids ; but we shall give a more
detailed report when he has sent us the full accounts which he
has promised.

   The chemical action of the solar rays on bodies is worthy of
every attention on the part of the learned, by its influence on
most of the phasnomcna of animated nature, and yet it has been
hitherto but little attended to.    M. Vogel has just added some
experiments    to those which   we  possessed on this head.     Am
monia and phosphorus, which do not act upon each other in the
dark, emit in the light phosphorated hydrogen gas, and deposit
a black power composed of phosphorus and ammonia intimately
combined.     It is nearly the same case with phosphorus and pot
ash. The action of the various rays is not always similar ; the
red rays do not produce any effect on a solution of corrosive sub
limate in ether ; whereas the blue rays and a full light effect a
mutual decomposition.       The highly oxidated metallic muriates
are brought in the same way to the minimum of oxidation.
   We said a few words the two last years on the researches of
M. Chevreul Aide, naturalist to the Museum of Natural His
tory, on soap and saponification.      This accurate experimenter
has ascertained that the action of potash produces between the
elements of grease new modes of combination, from which re
sult substances which did not exist completely formed before,
and two of which, viz. margarine and a kind of oil or fluid
grease, acquire all the properties of the acids.   The author pur
suing his  labours,  ascertained that the same effects are producefl
by soda, the alkaline and various metallic oxides, and that the
substances resulting are in the same proportion whatever agent
is made use of.     Magnesia and alumine, on the contrary, con
fine themselves to contracting      with fat a certain union, but
without separating the elements into various compounds.         The
quantity of alkali necessary for converting into soap a given
quantity of fat is precisely that which can saturate the marga
rine, and the oil which this fat produces.       Our laborious che
mist has terminated his memoirs on this subject, by assigning
the capacity of saturation of the margarine and the greasy fluid,
and by making known the properties of various new saponaceous
combinations, which he produced by the play of double affinities,
by mixing a hot solution of the fatty fluid and potash with va
rious earthy or metallic salts.     He thus succeeded in making
the soaps, the study of which had been hitherto neglected, al
most as well known as the salts, with which the chemists have
been most of all occupied.
   The late M. Fourcroy had made known under the name of
adipocire, a substance which is separated by means of the acids
from the fatty substance into which the bodies of animals buried
in the earth are converted, and he regarded it as the same with
that which is extracted in the crystalline state from the biliary
galculi of men, and with spermaceti.

                       Royal Institute    of France.               393
     M. Chevreul, led by the course of his researches on fatty sub
stances to examine these subjects, found that the adipocire of
the biliary calculi gives no soap ; whereas spermaceti supplies it
equally with fat : but it is then a little deteriorated, and in other
proportions, and with other properties.          The fat of dead bodies
is much more compounded than Fourcroy thought, and there
have been found in it various fatty substances combined with
ammonia, potash and lime.            It is a fatty substance which has
 already undergone the action of the alkalies.
     Every one must have observed a resinous excretion of aa
orange yellow colour which oozes from its fissures in the bark
of the beech-tree when exposed to humidity, in the form of
 threads curled like vermicelli.       M. Bidault de Villiers has made
 some chemical experiments on this substance.          He dissolved onn
 portion in water, another in alcohol, and the residue had several
 of the properties of gluten.        The nitric acid converts it into
 oxalic acid, into a very abundant yellowish matter, and into a
greasy substance ; but it produces in it no mucous acid.              It
yields in the fire much carbonate of ammonia and a fetid oil :
 in short, it must be regarded as resembling, very closely, animal
 substances in its nature.       It will be interesting to make some
inquiries into the causes of its production.
     One of the, aeras at which chemistry seemed to shine most
 brilliantly, and to be most useful, was that, without contradiction,
 when France, separated for twenty years from those countries thfe
 productions of which had become so long to us true wants, was
 obliged to supply their place by the productions of her own
 soil. The arts which were known have been perfected ; neiv
  arts have been created.       We have seen in succession soda ex
  tracted from sea salt; alum and copperas formed ; colours ren
  dered fixed, which were before supposed to be fals? tints ; indigo
 supplied, and madder taking place of cochineal : while beet-root
  sugar was supplanting that obtained from the cane.
      This last article, the most important of all, has not yet lost
  all its interest.   It is true that many manufactories have ceased
  to -exist, but those which have been conducted with intelligence
  and skill still subsist and prosper : and according to Count Chap-
  tal, their products may always rival colonial sugars.        This ex
  perienced chemist gives an irrefragable proof of his assertion,
  since he continues the manufacture with profit : it is true that
   in all the details of the cultivation, the harvesting and the pre
   paration, as well as in the employment of the various kinds of
   refuse, he has taken advantage of the progress of science and
   experience, so far as not to reject any thing which can he o
   service, and to apply to other purposes whatever he has beea
   obliged to reject.     He has described his processes in a manner
                                                                       so

  valuable branch of industry, and which a thousand events might
  render one of absolute necessity.

            S ince     I forwarded my second paper to you on the sub
 ject of Aerial Navigation, I find from a paragraph in the
  Monthly Magazine that Messrs. S. 1. Pauly civil engineer and
  Mr. D. Egg of No. 32, Strand, are preparing an experiment on
  the steerage of a balloon capable of carrying three or four per
  sons.    The great bulk inseparable from aerial vessels that are
  capable of carrying any considerable burthen with such speed as
 will render the invention valuable to mankind, is not to be ex
 pected from individual efforts ; but I am glad to find professional
 engineers turning their attention to this subject ; and should any
  efficient subscription take place, I hope the committee ap
 pointed to regulate it will encourage these exertions ; and that
 by the aid of these gentlemen, in conjunction with the advice of
 the first civil engineers the country affords, experiments upon
 the most efficient scale may soon lead to the establishment of
  the art.

     M. de la Roche, in a memoir on the propagation of sound
 printed in a late number of the Annates de Chimie et de Phy
 sique, draws the following conclusions :
     I. That the wind exercises almost no sensible influence on
 sounds heard at short distances, for instance six metres. 2. When
 the distance is greater, the sound is heard far less in the direc
tion contrary to that of the wind, than in that of the wind itself.
The difference seems, to be the greater, in proportion as the di
stance itself is greater.
     From the approximation of those two propositions, M. de la
Roche thinks it results, 1 . That the law of decrement of sound
is not the same in the direction of the wind as in that which is
opposite to it.       2. That the influence of the wind on sound is
not more exercised on the spot where it has been produced, than
on every particle of ground which it passes over.           3. That sound
is heard    a little better in a direction perpendicular to that of

foreign to the wind, and depending on modifications of the atmo
sphere, have a very great influence on the facility with which
sound is propagated to a distance.

    Every circumstance that can elucidate the fate of the ex
plorer of Africa is interesting, although, from the length of
 time that has elapsed since he was la t heard of, the probability
-of his being in existence is so chimerical as scarcely to afford
 the most distant ray of its being realised.    The following                   is,
however,    a    singular coincidence,           and there can be no doubt but
the white men therein mentioned might be Mr. Park, and pro
bably his fellow traveller Lieutenant Martyn particularly as

white man, he attracted great notice) — was          woman who said

had seen a vessel in the European fashion, and manned by white

   Many of the slaves purchased at Tombuctoo and other places,
and brought by the Moors and Arabs across the Great Desert,
come from countries very far to the eastward ; it is therefore
not improbable to suppose that the place from whence this
woman came might be the kingdom of Ghana, or Cano, on the
Niger, lying between the 10th and 15th degrees of east longi
tude.    Supposing this correct, the curious relation of this per
son will afford reasonable ground for conjecturing that Mr. Parle
had made further progress on the Niger than where the guide
states he parted with him ; and as Mr. Park's death was by
drowning, together with his companions, and only occurred the
day after the guide gave up his charge, he could not have made
any great progress in his voyage.     The time that intervened be
tween the departure of Mr. Park from Sansanding, where he em
barked on the Niger the 17th of November 1805, and his re
ported death at Silla, either in March or early in April 18G6,
would greatly admit of his having reached a territory more di
stant than Kanno.     That this enterprising traveller has met his
death is almost certain ; but the time, place, or circumstances
under which it occurred, are enveloped in mystery, and rest
alone on the bare assertion of his guide, who, it must be recol
lected, was not an eye-witness of the event, but obtained the
information from others.
   At Wed-noon, the only white person whom Adams found
there was a Frenchman, who had been shipwrecked and taken
into slavery. The temptation'which had been held out to this
 man, as is invariably done by the followers of Mahomet to all
 Christians who unfortunately fall into their power, was too strong
for him to resist.   He had therefore turned Mahometan, and
was in consequence circumcised ; by which means he was im-
mediately'removed from slavery, allowed to marry, and was the
father of several children.   At this place he had resided twelve
years, and obtained a livelihood by making gunpowder, which
was purchased with great avidity by the Moors and Arabs, all of
whom were entirely ignorant of the process used in its manu
facture.   This secret the Frenchman studiously kept from them,
 and always made the gunpowder alone in a room of his house,
to which no one else had access.     It is reported that he is since
 dead.

                    STEAM ENGINES IN CORNWALL.
   The average work of thirty-one steam-engines in the month
of April, according to Messrs. Leans' Report, was 20,998,138
pounds lifted one foot high with each bushel of coals.        Woolf's
engine at Wheal Var lifted 43,998,178 pounds, and his engine
at Wheal Abraham 50,908,433 pounds with each bushel.
                       FULMINATING PLATINA.
    Mr. Davy, professor of chemistry to the Cork Institution, has
lately discovered a new combination of platina, which belongs
to the   class of fulminating metallic compounds,      and has some
curious properties.      It explodes by a moderate degree of heat ;
the explosion is accompanied by a flash of light ; and the pro-
duets are gases and metallic platina.         In ammoniacal gas, at
the common temperature of the atmosphere, this substance be
comes ignited ; and in liquid ammonia, gas is^copiously evolved
from it. When it is touched with alcohol, a slight crackling
noise is produced, and it burns with a red flame         Mr. Davy is
engaged     in the examination    of this compound,  and  will shortly
make known the results of his investigation.

Meteorological Observations made in Scotland, principally           at
      Edinburgh, from the 14i/i to the 25th of April 1816.
   April    14. — Fine cold day, with oecasional showers of small
snovr and sleet.    Wind from NW. The sea-gulls flew low about
the  rocks   below  West  Leith.    Night bright and clear.

P.M. The wind became high at night*.
    April 17. — feeing early this morning on           the high point of
ground called King Arthur's Seat, I noticed              the formation of
stackenclouds around me, while waneclouds in detachments ap
peared above, with some curlcloud.            During the day large twain-
cloud was formed with cirrous crowns ending in raincloud pouring
light hail and sleet. There is as yet scarcely any appearance of
spring here ; except the flower of the Crocus vernalis.
    April 18. — Obscure and cold, with snow all the afternoon.
The inhabitants of the city of Edinburgh complain of an unusually
protracted     winter.
    April    19. — Clear   morning; fragments of loose stackencloud
flying along     in the   wind.    The lighter modifications in a higher
atmosphere,       but  of confused   and indefinite character.
                 —
    April 20. Windy unpleasant day. A fine afternoon.
    April 21. — Fair warm day and calm, an evident change in
the atmosphere, abundance of curlcloud of varied forms, wane-
cloud, sondercloud of indefinite character, and stackencloud in
small quantity.        Obscure horizon.       Dark blue coloured sea, off
Leith coast.        Fine spring evening, with yellow polestreamer-s,
or northern lights.         No leaves on the trees here yet. Wane-
clouds by night.
    April 22. — Fine warm morning; various clouds; small rain
P.M.
    April   23. — Chiefly clouded over,        and cooler,  with a breeze.
Dark night.
    April   24. —This morning being out early, 1 noticed that the
tops of the hills were covered with fog, while their bases and the
town below were clear.           This cloud did not appear to be fall-
cloud,    but wanecloud.        The  latter is often a ground cloud like
the former, and it constitutes the wet as distinguished from the
dry mists.       Cloudy day with small rain, such as is called a Scotch
mist.
    April 25. — The same sort of mist and rain as yesterday.

   * Thf.  season lias certainly been unusually backward both in Scotland
and England, and the weather particularly changeable. As popular cla
mour deduces an unusual mortality, particularly of sudden deaths,      I am
induced to request the communication of facts on this subject from your
medical correspondents in different parts of the country, and also wish to
fcnow whether, in districts where it has most prevailed, any accurate obser
vations have been made on any peculiarities of the weather.

LXXXIII.         Some Account    of the Monuments of Thebes in Egypt.
                           [Continued  from p. 885.]
 Of      all the portions of the edifices of Medynat-Abou, the peri
style   in  the midst of which we are is indisputably that which
strikes most, by its imposing mass and character of grandeur:
we are convinced that its founders wished to render it indestruc
tible, and that the Egyptian architects charged with its con
struction have strained every nerve to make this monument pass
down to the most distant posterity.             The elegance of its co
lumns cannot, it is true, be boasted of, but they are colossal; they
are nearly seven feet and a half in diameter, and do not appear
to be too bulky to carry the enormous stones which form the
architraves and the roofs.           When we wish to give an account
of the sentiment of admiration which we experience at the sight
 of this edifice, we find that we are particularly ted away by the
grandeur of those lines which throughout a long space present
»o interruption, and the perfect execution of which answers to
 the magnificent manner in which they have been conceived.            If
 our architects had not already returned to sound principles, they
 would find here a proof that irregular or tormented lines and pro
jecting bodies can never be in architecfeure the source of anyspecies
 of grandeur and beauty. But what adds much to the effect
 produced by the peristyle are the caryatid pilasters which de
 corate it.      "  How, in fact, can we refrain from being seized with
 a religious and profound respect at the sight of that council of
 gods united, in some measure, to dictate the laws of wisdom and
 philanthropy which we see every where written on the walls of
 the palace !        The Egyptian artists, in throwing these statues
 of the gods against pillars which support rich roofs decorated
 with stars of a golden yellow colour scattered over a blue ground,
 seem to have wished to represent to us the supretneBeing under
 the azure vault which he fills with his immensity !         How pro
found must have been the impression produced by the sight of
 this place on the ancient Egyptians, with whom every thing had
a mvstical and religious meaning, if we who are strangers to
their manners, customs and worship, cannot penetrate without
 emotion into the midst of these galleries, every supporter of           -'-
 which is a god ! How nobly monumental is the simplicity of
 the attitudes and the form of the statues, and how greatly does
 the rigid immoveability add to the imposing aspect of the whole
  edifice!     What a superficial examination might induce us to re
 gard    as  the  infancy of the art, seems on the contrary to be the
 result of a foreseen and calculated perfection."

402                 Some Account     of   the Monuments
    I  have given the above passage from the Description de
PEgypte entire; and I shall give others still, because the mere
 expression of the effects of these monuments on the observer
 may suggest in the imagination of the reader ideas which the
 simple indication of these dead masses could not possibly give.
 The northern part of the palace is almost wholly in ruins; never
 theless we can distinguish several chambers which appear to
 have been inhabited.
    What is most remarkable in those ruins is the sculpture with
 which the external and internal surfaces of this palace are covered.
 Those outside are historical : they are generally battles or sea-
 fights.    In the land battles there are several in which the vic
 tory is on the side of the Egyptians.           The chief or king always
 appears   in a  car ; he  is of a colossal  size, and armed with a lance
 and bow    and   arrows.   The  wheels   of his chariot  break the enemy's
 ranks.     The Egyptians are partly in the midst of the fight:
 other columns also come up in succession.                 This same figure
 of the king reappears several times : sometimes he marches
 slowly and stops, and sometimes he pushes his coursers into the
 midst of his enemies.         In other parts there is a lion hunt de
 scribed.     The king in his car pursues into the thickest part of
 the wood two lions, one of which is just expiring ; the other,
 which still flies, is struck by four arrows. The most remarkable
 of these representations, however, is the naval combat.               It re
 presents   an  invasion   repelled,   in  which    the victory has  already
 declared for the Egyptians.         The king is placed on the shore ;
 under his feet are enemies biting the dust ; there are others be
 fore him ; — he looks sternly at the enemy.              Quite close to the
 shore is the battle of the two fleets.         The Egyptian vessels, en
 tirelv different from those of the Nile (they may well be called
 long vessels,) have their prows shaped like lions' heads, those of
 the enemy are of similar construction.            The combat is evidently
 not terminated, but victory will decide for the Egyptians. Some
 of the enemy's ships are entangled, others are taken, some are
 sinking. We see in these representations the rudiments of naval
 tactics.    The enemy's squadron is surrounded by that of the
 Egyptians', and apparently there is no chance of its escaping.
 In all these hostile pictures the different nations are carefully
 distinguished from each 'other by their dress and armour.                 In
 the   land   combats     the  enemy    have   always   the  beard  and   the
 tunic long.       In the naval combat they wear short and light
 habits : part of them wear a bonnet, like the caps of modem
 soldiers, and surmounted with feathers; others have leathern
 helmets,,
     By these traits we recognise a southern nation : and the
  French artists have taken them for Indians. This variety of
                                                                    costume

costume is also religiously observed in the pictures which form
 the rest of the series. But the greater part of the building being
in ruins, these representations are in bad preservation 5 besides,
 there have been no drawings of them yet taken.
     The sculptures of the interior of the palace are of a different
 kind, but they are still analogous.         They consist of triumphal
 marches intimately connected with religious ceremonies : not
-only are the processions directed towards the gods, but the gods
themselves take part in them.          The most curious of these bas-
 reliefs are to be seen on the fine peristyle which we have men
 tioned. One of the walls of this part of the palace represents
 the victorious king stopping in his chariot; we recognise his
 royalty by the serpent on his head. The horses adorned by rich
 coverings are caressed by grooms: the king in a majestic atti
 tude seems" to turn round and desire the prisoners to be brought
 to him. The latter arrive by threes and fours at a time, led by
 an Egyptian.      This march is represented by the artists in four
 rows raised above each other. The prisoners are enveloped in
 cloaks of a blue and green colour, under which they have still
 another covering.' The Egyptians have white vestments with
 red streaks: the colours have preserved all their brilliancy.
 The prisoners are without arms — the hands are in different atti
 tudes, partly tied over the head.       In front of the car of the con
  queror are the bands and parts of generation of those who have
  perished : the prisoners brought in are not mutilated.
      On the northern wall of this peristyle is represented a trium
  phal march.     The king seated on his throne is carried by eight
  warriors in a rich palanquin: these warriors are decorated with
  feathers, the emblems of victory.         The throne is covered with
  a superb carpet ; the feet of the conqueror rest on a cushion :
  he bears in his hand the cross and the keys, the attributes of
  divinity ; two genii placed behind him cover him with their
  wings.    The lion, the stag, the serpent, and the sphinx, the sym
  bols  of his grandeur, are by his side.        The procession is com
  posed of warriors decorated with palms and feathers, and of
  priests who offer up incense.      A priest with a scroll in his hand
  seems to proclaim the exploits of the conqueror.         The cavalcade
  proceeds   towards  the temple  of Osiris,  whose  statue is to be seen.
  Four priests go before the    hero   to conduct him into the temple,
  where he is to offer his sacrifices.     Soon the march is continued :
  the god himself, quitting his sacred residence, accompanies the
  king, and twenty- four priests bear the god under a magnificent
  canopy.     The conqueror, who has changed his clothes and head-
. dross, opens the march.     Above him flies the stag, and the sacred
  bull accompanies the procession,          hi front of it march seven
   teen priests bearing the attributes of the divinity,-  '     In general

404              Some Account     of the Monuments
this march has become a religious procession-: the priests, and no
longer the warriors, are now the principal personages.              Soon
again   the  scene  changes entirely,    and   the  king performs the
functions of sacrificing high-priest.       It is remarkable that this
scene seems to relate to agriculture.         A priest presents to the
 king a handful of stalks which he cuts with a hook : after
 wards he offers his gifts to the divinity.      We ought to separate
 this scene entirely from the preceding one, and represent the
 king protecting the arts of peace, as the former shows him in
 his military glory.    This senigma would not be one to us with
 out doubt if the whole of the sculptures had been preserved.
    One of the lateral halls also contains some curious sculptures :
 they seem to represent the initiation of the king into the my
 steries.
    The royal candidate is purified in the first place by some
 priests.   Others take him by the hand to introduce him into the
 sanctuary.     Here every thing is mysterious.        The priests are
 almost all covered with masks of animals.
    In all these representations the French authors see the ex
 ploits of Sesostris, to whom, in fact, we may ascribe this palace.
    At some distance from the palace, to the north-west, is the
 Temple of Medynat-Abou, which fronts the Nile. This temple
 has buttresses which are not finished, and which seem to be of
 an origin posterior to that of the principal temple.       It is almost
 entirely in ruins ; the distribution of its parts is in conformity
with that of the other temples.
    To the north-west of this temple a plain extends which is
extremely curious: it is partly covered with a forest of Mimosa,
 and bears the name of the field of the Colossi.         Not less than
seventeen colossal figures are counted in it : some are in an erect
posture, others are only half erect, and some are completely
 thrown drown.      Among them is the famous colossus of Mem-
non, which at sun-rise emitted certain sounds.            '
    In the first place, strangers remark two colossi joined toge
ther, now called the one on the north Thama, and the other Chama
on the south ; both of them front the Nile.           They are both of
free-stone, are forty-eight feet high without the pedestal,' — in
all sixty. The weight of each when whole is estimated at
2,612,000 lbs.      The Chama is in one piece ; the upper part of
the other is composed of five pieces.         As all the colossi of the
Egyptians were monolites, it cannot be doubted that the
Thama was so originally.         It is this same statue which, from
the interpretation of the inscriptions which it received in the
two first centuries of the Christian era, was regarded as that of
 Memnon ; for the inscriptions say that he who engraved them
had heard the sound of the colossu>.          Doubts, however, have
                                                                    been

                                of Theles in Egypt.                       405
been started of this fact, founded partly on the quality and co
lours of the stone*, partly on a passage of Strabo, in which it
is said that in his time the stone was broken in the middle,
which is confirmed by the description of Pausanias.       It is added
also, that it is unknown at what period the colossus must have
been repaired.    All these doubts, however, cannot have much
weight. The stone is in fact, according to the representation
of the French authors, a free-stone blackened by the influence
of the air: and because we are ignorant who repaired the statue,
we cannot reject the evidence that it has been so repaired.         If
we might hazard an hypothesis, might we not suppose that the
reign of Septimus Severus, who made so many reparations of
monuments in Egvpt, was the era ?
   Some distance from thence, to the N.W., we are struck with
two immense moles of stones loaded with hieroglyphics; they
have probably served as pedestals for two other colossi.        More
to the northward, beside a triple row of columns we find a con
siderable fragment of a colossus in the attitude of walking,
thirty feet high ; — a little further on there is the trunk of a
statue seated, of black granite.      To the north are the remains
of a column of yellow marble, marching ; — further on are the
ruins of two others of red granite, seated ; — two others succeed,
forty feet high each, marching. In general, if it is now proved
that'since the commencement of our era the soil has been raised
from 15 to 20 feet on this point, how many broken or over
thrown statues may be still concealed under ground !
   How came this quantity of colossi to be heaped' up in this
apparent disorder?     This is the first question which occurs.
Tbe appearance of the place, the ruins of the columns scattered
here and there, give reason to suppose that there was an im
mense building formerly there, the whole length of which, with
the pylones, the courts, the galleries and apartments, could not
be less than 1800 feet.      It is apparently before the pylones and
before the entrances of the courts and porticos that these colossi
were placed : we see this at least in the Palace of Osymandyas,
and others.    In general it was not customary in Egypt to place
   * Pococke and Norden differ in
                                       opinion respecting the statue of Mem-
non.   Pococke, vol.   ii. p. 101, considers    itto be the colossus which we
have described.    Norden,      ii. p. 128, (edition of M. Lanples) seeks for

and which   is  broken in the middle.        Count Veltheim has defended the
opinion of Norden      his Antiquaritche Aufsaetze,
                      in                              t.  ii. p. 69 but his rea

sons are not very plausible.     The inscriptions on the colossus of Pococke
evidently prove that at the period when they were made this colossus was
regarded as that of Memnon.           Is    probable that without some reason
                                           it
the tradition has been transferred from one statue to another?         The opi
nion of NordeB1  is supported also    by that of M. Langles.
                                     Cc    3                           colossi

 406                Some Account      of the Monuments
 colossi anywhere else than within or in front of die buildings.
 As to the sphinxes which formed alleys, it was. certainly other
 wise.     But what confirms our opinion is, that Strabo and Pliny
 place the colossus of Memnon in an edifice which the former
 calls the Memnonium, and which the other calls the Serapeum.
 Nevertheless, if the enormous dimensions which a building must
 have had adorned by such colossi, excite astonishment, it ap
 pears no less extraordinary that such slight remains of it are to
 be found.     This new doubt will vanish of itself, if we suppose
 that the building was of limestone; and nothing contradicts this
 opinion, for in fact the materials of those buildings have since
 been used for lime.        Their number must have been consider
 able ; the immense excavations in the calcareous rocks prove
 this.    There likewise remains near this colossus the remains of
 an ancient building constructed of this stone.
     It is also more to the northward that the building is to be
 found which modern travellers, and particularly Norden, ge
nerally call Memnonium*, but which must be designated the
Palace and Tomb of Osymandvas.                The ruins of this building
 are among the most picturesque of those of ancient Thebes.
 This palace was built of free-stone.           The pyloncs, many of the
columns and caryatid pillars of this building, are still standing,
while the ruins of so many others are heaped up around in hil
locks. Here also we enter by a superb gateway into a square
court, which is upwards of 140 feet long by 161 broad.                  It is
ip ruins, with the exception of two columns still standing,
and so encumbered with blocks of granite as to resemble a quavry
more than a court.            By and by we discover the ruins of a
formidable colossus destroved with violence, but of which the
head with a foot and a hand still remain.               The fore finger is
nearly four feet long, the distance from one shoulder to the
pther in a straight line is twenty-one feet.           The height of the
whol^ could not have been less than forty-five feet. The pedestal,
eighteen feet high, is still standing opposite the second gateway.
The pedestal, like the colossus itself, is of the finest red granite.
 It is near this city also that we still find the spot from which
this mass of two millions of pounds has been detached, in order
to be conyeyed to the place vvhich it afterwards occupied,, forty-
   * in order   to avoid all confusion in the topographv of Thebes, it must
be observed that Norden and other travellers call Memnonium or Palace
of Memnon, that which with more reason ouaht to be called the Palace of
Osvmandyas.      Pococke falls into another error, in taking lor the Mem
nonium the Palace of Medynat-Abou. Sir W. Hamilton is also of his
opinion.    Nevertheless it is between these two buildings that the building
in ruins is to be found, to which the statue of Memnon belonged, and to
which Strabo has given the name of Memnonium.

five leagues off.      The researches made on the spot have shown
that this building contained four similar colossi, one of which of
granite seems to have been placed beside that just mentioned.
    By a second buttress, less elevated than the former, we enter
into a peristyle which is also 140 feet long by 160 broad.        This
peristyle was surrounded by galleries formed to the north and
the south by a double row of columns ; on the east by a single
row of caryatid pillars, and on the west by columns and caryatid
pillars.   The southern part is demolished; but the northern
part is in sufficient preservation to enable us to judge of the
whole with some certainty.        This peristyle also contains two
colossi, each about twenty-three feet high.         One is entirely of
black granite ; the other has also a black body, but the head
is of red granite.      This head is preserved.     It has a calmness
full of grace, and that happy physiognomy which more than
beauty itself has the art of pleasing ; the corners of the mouth,
a little raised towards the eye, express a smile.          We cannot
represent a divinity under traits which can make it more vene»
rated.
    From the peristyle we enter by three doors into a vast apart
ment, the roof of which is supported by sixty columns in ten
rows, each containing six columns ; four of those columns are
still standing, but dispersed.      This hall was divided into three
compartments         We may conceive an idea of the majesty of
the whole, when we recollect that the columns of the middle
compartment, greater than the rest, are thirty-five feet high,
and more than six feet in diameter.           Adjoining this hall is a
second and a third, and in each are eight columns still standing,
and of the same size.
    Such are the remains of a building which, great as it now
appears, must have been formerly still more extensive.            If it
excite admiration as a monument of architecture, it is not less re
markable on account of the sculptures which cover its walls. The
latter are still partly covered with sacred hieroglyphics, and partly
historical bas-reliefs.    The former represent, as usual, divinities,
and the offerings which are made to them; but the bas-reliefs
deserve a particular examination.       Unfortunately it is the same
with them as with the whole building — a small part only re
mains.
    The first of these bas-reliefs is on the interior surface of the
first of the two grand buttresses.        It is a representation of a
battle —  The infantry advance in close column : at the head is
the chief, of a colossal height, in a chariot.     Further off is seen
the tumult of the battle.     The chiefs in their chariots precipitate
themselves on the enemy.         Dead, wounded, and dying — men
and horses flying— all is confusion.       In the middle of the field

408                Some Account     of the Monuments
of battle a river     is seen, into which ihe fugitives throw them
 selves, while their countrymen are ready to receive them on the
 oppositive bank.      On the left side of the buttress a hero is seen
 of colossal stature seated on a throne elegantly adorned.            His
 feet rest on a footstool on which captives are represented.         The
 cushions of the seat and of the footstool seem to be precious
 stuffs studded with stars.     A procession of twenty-one persons
 in long vestments approach him in a respectful and suppliant
 posture. Hard by we see chariots and warriors with immense
 bucklers. The army to which they seem to belong has a rear
 guard of infantry and chariots, each carrying a warrior.            The
 baggage is assailed by the enemy, but vigorously defended. The
 walls of the peristyle exhibit representations not less interesting.
 There is a combat there also. It is a hostile invasion repulsed.
 A river traverses the field of battle, forming numerous sinuosities.
 In several places we see the remains of the blue colour with
 which the river was painted.        It waters a fort, the object of the
 movements on both banks.          The inhabitants of the fort, how
 ever, have passed the river.       They have beards and long tunics :
 three are in each chariot.
    The Egyptians, on foot or mounted in chariots, are commanded
by their king and divided into detachments, each having its head
 or chief of a higher stature than the rest. They overwhelm every
 thing which they meet on their passage, and trample under foot
 the dead and dying.        Numbers of the enemy are drowned in
 trying to pass the river.     They are pursued by the victors.
    On the walls of the great hall is represented an assault, and
at the same time the taking of a fort, perhaps the continuation
of the foregoing battle.      At the foot of the wall we see a kind
of tortoise formed by large bucklers.         Behind, and partly under
this maehine, are the warriors, whose feet only are uncovered.
A ladder is applied : soldiers ascend it. Already is the first of
the four approaches to the fort gained ; the battle continues :
the besieged throw down stones and burning substances.                But
the issue of the combat is    no  longer  doubtful ; and  the flag which
is seen, is perhaps, although pierced with arrows, the -signal
that they wish to surrender.       It is to be presumed that the parts
of the palace which are destroyed, represented the triumph of
the conqueror: and if this palace be in fact that of Osymandyas,
described by Diodorus, we should have found a still more inter
esting scene, — the supreme tribunal of Egypt, and the grand
judge having the symbol of truth on his breast.
    The western district between those grand buildings and the
 Libyan chain is not without its monuments.             We there see a
 Temple    of  Isis, smaller  but   curious  and well  preserved.    It is
 here particularly that we remark in all its lustre the play of cc—
                                                     ^            louring

louring with which the bas-reliefs are adorned.                The dimensions
of this building admit of our taking in the whole at a single
glance, and of judging with more certainty of the effect pro
duced by those ornaments.    M. Denon takes this occasion to
remark, that " in this case the union of sculpture and painting,
which might appear strange, presents nothing disgusting at first
sight.  The eye is rather pleased with the sensations which it
 excites."
    The bas-reliefs refer to religious subjects : the most curious of
the whole is a judgement of the dead, as it is painted on several
monuments*.        It is very probable that this temple served at
 the same time for a' burial-place.
    On proceeding from this monument of the palace of Osv-
mandyas northward, we find ourselves in the midst of an alley of
 pedestals which is only interrupted to begin once more.          Ri
 gorous inquiries have proved that this was an alley of sphinxes
 to the number of two hundred, all of colossal size, if we may
judge by the pedestals, which are six feet broad by twelve long.
 The breadth of the alley was forty feet, the distance of the
 statues seven. What must have been the size of the edifice to
 which this allev led ! We find enormous ruins of buttressesj
 walls, and stair-cases; but nothing entire.        What is also re
 markable is a building which presents the form of a vault, with
out there being one actually, as the most scrutinous inquiries
have demonstrated ; a new proof that arches were entirely un
known to the Egyptians.
    There still remains on this side of the Nile the building north
west of Thebes, near the village of Kurnu, the name of which
it also bears. The Palace* of Kurnu, ( El Gurnu according to
Sir W. Hamilton,) although not among the number of the mag
nificent monuments of this ancient residence, is nevertheless too
large to entitle us to suppose that it was the residence of an in
dividual.   This monument is the more remarkable (not being a
temple),  as  it seems to offer a medium between the vast palaces
of the kings and the houses of individuals.     We find here neither
sphinxes, nor obelisks, nor those enormous buttresses, nor a co-

 410                On the "Principles of Security in

colossal, it is nevertheless very large.        A portico 150 feet long,
supported by ten columns, forms the entrance : , this is preserved
 almost entire.     Two door-ways lead from the porticos into the
interior of the building. By the middle door-way, which is the
largest, we enter a vestibule supported by six columns ; beyond
this several doors open from the halls and apartments.                The
door-way of the portico on the left also leads into a hall, beside
which are several other halls, and further on some smaller apart
ments.     The i ight side seems to have been arranged in the same
 way,  but  the whole of it is in ruins.         The whole building was
therefore composed of three parts, independent of each other,
but united by the grand entrance portico.            This palace differs
from the rest also in so far as it is without those historical or
religious representations which cover their walls.              We must
conclude, however, that if it has not been the residence of
kings, it must be at least admitted that it was inhabited by some
grandee of the empire *.

LXXXIV.         On the Principles      of Security in Sir Humphry
              Davy's Lamp.          By J. Murray, Esq.
                             To   Mr. Tilhch.
Sir, — Tn      page 3 19 of the Annals of Philosophy, an anonymous
correspondent attacks the security of Sir H. Davy's safe-lamp :
1. Because the Philosophical Magazine approves; and, 2. Be
cause the principle on which its safety rests has not been de
veloped. You will, sir, no doubt, allow this writer whatever be
nefit his objections may claim from the first.          I shall endeavour
to relieve the second ground of his scruples, premising that it
appears to me unwise and unbecoming to indulge in scepticism
because the principles of the phenomenon are veiled from ken.
In the needle, the polarity is palpable to sense — the cause, un
known.      In the case of this curious instrument, has it not un
dergone (t the torture of the fire ?"       I lament to see the remarks
of Dr. Reid Clanny, and the mode he has adopted in intro-*
ducing himself to public notice — whatever analogy may obtain
in the lamp constructed by Stephenson and the first projection
of Davy, there is no semblance whatever between the lamp of
Dr. Reid Clanny and the latter.
   * For the beautiful engraving of this building which accompanies the
present number, we are indebted to the kindness of Mr. C. Taylor, of
Hatten Garden.    It is one of the many elegant plates which embellish the
work entitled Egypt, now publishing by Mr. Taylor.

   When a bar of metal, &c. is plunged into flame, there is a chasm
around the cylinder of about one-sixteenth of an inch width,
and it is important to remark that this distance is maintained,
however unequal the diameter of the rod may be — a mass se
veral inches thick, and wire of the most delicate dimensions,
equally repel the surface of flame.       Hence the plexus of wire
has no reference to the magnitude of the metal employed in its
fabrication.    There will, therefore, be no danger, in wire of a
proper thickness, of the meshes being dissolved by the action of
flame : besides, the lamp will only be subject to the continued
attack of the flame of fire-damp for a few seconds occasionally.
In an atmosphere which has reached the maximum, the lamp i«
extinguished; and where the carbonated hydrogen mixes onlv
in minute proportion, the flame of the lamp is magnified to an
extent which is insufficient to fill up the cylinder, or approach
nearly to the interior surface of the sides of the wire-gauze.
Parallel bars, I found, prevented the communication of flame
with equal facility as wire-gauze. The interval must not exceed
one-eighth of an inch. Here, therefore, is a limit pointed out to
H8 : — If the meshes are one-sixteenth of an inch apart, no danger
would occur should an accident break down the alternate one.
When the bars are crossed by others at right angles, it consti
tutes a double security.      The phaenomena described are sup
ported when the wire is red hot.       The phenomenon is not mag
netic, for copper, zinc, and silver, ward off the flame as well as
iron and nickel ; nor is it connected with electrics and non-
electrics, for bars of glass, &c. serve the purpose as well as rods
of metal.    A concave surface of silver attracts flame, but still
maintains the "appointed" distance.          Is this interval filled up
with caloric, distinct from the combustion ? We may thrust a
match into a cone of flame, and it is only burnt exterior to the
surface, where its temperature appears to be exalted to ignition.
Were it simply an envelope of emanating heated agate and
carbonic acid gas, combustion would be prevented.             Flame will
not kindle gunpowder ; and, on the contrary, inflammable gases
are not acted upon by the spark, unless exalted into at least
incipient flame.     This remarkable fact merits investigation.
   I made sieves of hair, whale-bone, &c. and found them secure
as metallic wire.
   The lamp of Sir H. Davy is indeed " a present from philo
sophy to the arts," and its distinguished author
                                                          " well merits
the civic crown."       Science never shines with a sublimer lustre
than when regarding the interests of humanity.

   LXXXV.        Some Account     of the new Hot and Cold Balfis at
                    Ramsgate.      By A Correspondent.
   It has been remarked        by intelligent travellers, that of all the
   situations on the coast of Great Britain, frequented for the pur
   pose of sea-bathing, no where are the two great requisites
   of salubrity of elimate and picturesqueness of scenery mora
   strikingly united than in the isle of Thanet.           The beautiful
   district of rising ground known by that name, is the most eastern
   point of land in England, and consists of a solid mass of chalk
   shelving into the German Ocean, above the level of which it is
   considerably raised, forming a romantic peninsula, having four-
   fifths of its boundary washed by the sea.
       In consequence of the immense beds of calcareous matter
   which compose this peninsula, the air is remarkably pure and
   free from moisture; as an effect of the rapid absorption of hu
   midity by the soil, no stagnant water is to be met with, and the
   rain which falls disappears so rapidly, that the most delicate in
   valid may walk out with perfect safety immediately after the
    most copious shower.
       The town of Ramsgate, which stands on the southern side of
    the island, enjoys all these advantages in a very eminent degree.
   From being built in a valley formed by an indentation in the
   cliff, somewhat in the manner of an amphitheatre, open to
   wards the sea, it is completely screened from the cold winds to
   which the towns on the opposite side are exposed.         Its sheltered
   situation promotes that luxuriant vegetation in the town and its
   immediate neighbourhood, which forms a striking contrast to the
   bleak and monotonous scenery of other bathing places.
       Notwithstanding the great number of persons, however, who
   annually visit Ramsgate for bathing and recreation, in conse
   quence of its excellent beach and various other attractions, no
   establishment on a scale adequate to the rising importance of
   the place, has been hitherto formed for hot sea-water bathing. A
   building, from the designs of Mr. Meikleham, has therefore been
'. lately erected at Ramsgate for warm sea-water bathing, which,
   from the scientific nature of its construction and arrangement,
   promises to be one of the greatest acquisitions to the public,
   since the introduction of the warm baths into England.
       The new baths are situated on the west cliff at Ramsgate,
   and at an elevation of one hundred and ten feet above the level
   of the sea : they range with the other buildings of the Paragon,
   having the space between the front and the cliff laid out as a
   promenade.     (Plate III.)
       A horizontal  tunnel has been excavated in the rock, running

at the level of low water under the building, to a distance of one
hundred and eighty feet, until it joins with a vertical tunnel from
the top. The tide ebbs and flows in this horizontal tunnel; and
the pumps in the vertical one, are so placed as always to get
their supply at high water.       In order to have the supply as free
from vegetable impurities as possible, a wooden trunk has been
carried from the entrance of the tunnel to a distance of one hun
dred and five feet into the sea ; having gratings at small di
stances to intercept the weed, which might be driven into the
pumps by the violence of the tide.         This tunnel has a sluice at
its upper extremity for the purpose of clearing out the sand
which may subside at the bottom by means of a back current.
     The pumps are worked by horses ; and the water after being
 raised 110 feet, flows into a large reservoir, from which it is
 conveyed through pipes into the boilers and other parts of the
 building.
     The building which contains the baths is 120 feet long and
 34 feet deep, fronting the sea. This building is divided into
 three parts, viz. a circular centre, with the baths and dressing*
 rooms in each wing; the front is finished with handsome stone
 ornaments.      Two flights of steps conduct into the saloon fi
 nished with pilasters at equal distances on its circumference, and
 is furnished with the daily papers, reviews, and other periodical
 publications for the accommodation of those who use the baths,
 and the floor is five feet above the level of the promenade for the
 advantage of a more extended prospect, and surmounted with
 an elegant ornamented dome-ceiling.           The semicircumference
 of this room is open towards the sea ; and a person seated in
  the centre of it commands one of the most extensive and varied
  prospects in the world. The country from Pegwell to Canter
  bury, — the bay itself in its whole sweep ; point of Dover ; the
 shipping in the Downs; the coast of France from Dunkirk to
  Boulogne ; and in the afternoon when the cliffs are illuminated
  by the setting sun, every indentation of the coast is clearly dis
  cernible to the naked eye, appearing but a few miles distant ;
  immediately under the windows, the shipping in Ramsgate har
  bour, and its celebrated pier stretching into the bay.          In the
  evening  the glimmering   of the several light-houses in the distance,
  the lamps of the vessels passing through the channel, the bright
  light on the pier-head illuminating the foreground, form altogether
  one of the most enchanting scenes we have ever witnessed.
     The baths, which are formed of white marble, are each placed
  in a room, lighted and ventilated from the ceiling, and commu
  nicating with their separate dressing-rooms.       They are in length,
  width and depth, of the dimensions of the celebrated warm baths
  at Naples, which are so large as to allow invalids using the fric-

tion brush, to do   so conveniently,      without exposing any part of
the body above the surface of the water.           Pipes from the reser
voirs and boilers, conduct hot and cold water into each, and
another communicating with the drains allows it to run off after
being used in a bath.        The unsightly apparatus of pipes and
cocks are here kept entirely out of view, and the whole apart
ment has-quite the air of an ancient Roman bath.              The dressing-
rooms attached to each bath are of a very ample size, having a
sea prospect, and they are fitted up with every thing that can
administer to the comfort and pleasure of the bather.
    The shower baths are constructed to have a supply either of
cold or hot water, and the dressing-rooms which are attached to
them, arc furnished in the same manner as the others.
    Vapour -baths are also included in these establishments, and
we understand modelled after those recommended and invented
by the honourable Mr, Cochrane.               From the several contri
vances for increasing or decreasng the temperature of the va
pour, it can be applied generally to the whole body, or topically
to any particular part of       with the greatest certainty and pre
                              it,

the same apparatus, and heated air can be introduced into this
apartment to act as     a Russian sweating bath, with the oppor
tunity of using at the same time the cold or the hot shower-
baths.
    This establishment, however, has another claim towards being
unique in kind.      Steam has been applied to heating buildings
 for the purposes of manufactures, but .this            the first successful

elegance with the greatest convenience and certainty.                    The

which  it   isconducted under the floors          by

of the coldest days in February, the temperature of the whole
 building was as high as 65°, and had, all the delightful warmtk
of a day in summer. From the various contrivances for admitting
 the steam, or stopping      it off from any particular part of the
 building, and directing      to any other particular apartment ot

examining a model of a chemical apparatus for producing chaly

before our readers.
    The last and not the least improvement in this establishment
is the verv rnoderate sum which is intended to be charged for each

infinitely superior accommodation for the same money.
        LXXXVI.     On Indigogene.      By  J. Murrav,   Esq.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir, —     I bhg to submit some remarks on the substance called
fey Brugnatelli indigogene.
     It is obtained from indigo, a substance one of the products of
 the Indigo/era and Isatis, and the varied species of which are
 natives of the East Indies, Cape of Good Hope, and New Hol
 land. The extract from the letter of M. Van Mons of Brussels,
 in the Philosophical Magazine, first called my attention towards
 this curious body.
     If indigo in the form of powder be projected on a red hot
 iron, a vapour of a bluersh colour arises, and a red shade passes
 over the surface of the iron.        This vapour exhales a peculiar
  odour somewhat resembling burnt malt ; and when condensed,
 the indigogene is evolved under the form of fine needlelike cry
 stals of a copper colour and lustre : viewed through a lens, some
 times arborescent groups appear.       The mode which I adopt for
 procuring the indigogene is as follows:
     A small glass capsule (a watch glass will suit) containing the
 -powdered indigo is set in one of the sliding rings of the stand
 usually accompanying an Argand's lamp. A flat piece of glass is
  placed on the capsule, and it is then submitted to the action of
  heat.    Water is first given off, then succeeds a reddish vapour,
  which attaches to the flat piece of glass (from which it is diffi
  cultly removed by spirits of turpentine); and ultimately, after the
  heat has bean considerably increased, the substance in question
                                                                    is

416                   On the State        of the Manufacture
-is seen to pervade the surface of the indigo (which becomes a
 crust) • It may be detached by means of a delicate spatula. The
odour at first is unpleasant, but it becomes more mild and some
 what like that of sweet wort; or it may be obtained by heating
 indigo on a metallic plate.      I have seen similar crystals on
the sides of the indigo vat, from whence it seemed to have su
blimed.
   I find that indigogene is readily soluble in sulphuric acid and
also in nitric acid, communicating to each a green colour.       It is
not  soluble  in muriatic acid,  nor in a solution of boiling caustic
potassa, nor in ammonia.
   It is soluble in olive oil, even when cold, and in naphtha and
cajeput oil with the assistance of heat.      Ammonia added to the
solution in oil of olives does not materially evolve the substance,
but from naphtha and cajeput oil it is disengaged unaltered.
    Indigogene is soluble in hot alcohol and sulphuric ether.   It
is instantly dissolved by an alcoholic solution of camphor being
increased by heat, but is not so soluble in soap dissolved by spi
rit, communicating to these a blue tinge.
    Indigogene when projected on melted nitrate of potassa de
tonates, and slightly explodes when mixed with oxymuriate
potassa on the contact of sulphuric acid.
    Indigogene does not combine with mercury by simple triture,
but forms an amalgam aided by heat. Before the blowpipe
when in a platina spoon it scintillates and inflames, a violet va
pour evolves, and a blue shade crowns the surface of platina. —
By percussion with oxymuriate potassa it fulminates with flame.
The effects of various reagents may form the subject of a future
paper.                                    v

LXXXVN.       On the State of the Manufacture             of Sugar in France.
                      By M. le Comte Chaptal.
                             [Concluded   from p. 339.]                        :
The      boiler into which the cleared juice falls should be about
eight feet long, five and a half wide, and twenty-two inches deep.
As soon as the bottom of this boiler is covered with the liquid,
the fire is lighted, and the heat raised to ebullition as quick as
possible.    The instant the liquor begins to boil, sulphuric acid,
diluted with twenty parts of water, is poured into             it,
                                                        in the pro
portion   ofa  tenth part of the  lime employed    the  whole
                                                          ;    rauit

                        of Sugar in France.                      417
be well stirred, that it may be completely mixed.         In order to
ascertain that there is no excess of lime or of acid in the liquor,
it may be tried upon paper coloured with turnsole or curcuma.
It is best to suffer the excess of lime to remain, and to employ
no more of the acid, the moment that it gives to the curcuma
paper a tint of a pale brick or deep white wine colour.         After
this operation, three per cent. of animal charcoal, well pounded
to an impalpable powder, is mixed with the liquor, and imme
diately afterwards is added half of the charcoal that was used the
evening before.
    It has been observed that charcoal which comes from the pre
paration of prussian blue produces a better effect than that which
proceeds from the distillation of animal matters in the manu
factories of sal-ammoniac, which seems to retain the state of ex
treme division that is effected by the calcination; for it is ascer
tained that animal charcoal produces a greater effect in propor
tion as it is more attenuated and divided by pounding.         M. Fi-
guier    of Montpellier was the  first who discovered the  superiority
 of animal charcoal to that of wood for decolorating liquids; and
 M. Derosne's application of it to the syrup of beet-root is so
 much the happier, as this charcoal, besides its property of de
 colorating, destroys the bad effects of the lime, and gives greater
facility to the boiling.
     After the last addition of charcoal the liquid is evaporated
 till it has acquired the consistence of from 1 8 to 20 degrees ; it
 is then made to run into a smaller and deeper boiler, and is left
 at rest till the next day, when the boiling of the syrup is ef
fected.
                     The   Boiling and Refining.
  The operation of boiling the syrup is the most delicate of
any; but it has been rendered extremely easy by the improve
ments that have taken place in the preparatory operations, es
pecially since the use of animal charcoal has been introduced.
Many manufacturers have failed in boiling the syrup ; and that
which should be attributed to a bad manipulation, has generally
been supposed to be owing sometimes to the non-existence of
sugar in the beet, and sometimes to the almost insurmountable
difficulty of extracting it.   Now, this operation is become so
easy that scum rises ; it never burns during the boiling, and re
quires very little more care on the part of the workman. who
conducts it.
    Previous to the boiling, the concentrated juice made the even
ing before, and which still retains some degree of heat, is        fil
tered through   a coarse piece of woollen cloth    5  then poured
                                                       it   is

 deep, till it is one-third full, and is then heated to ebullition,
 which is Jcept tip to the end of the operation.                If it chance to
 burn, it is perceived by puffs of white smoke, which come from
 the bottom of the boiler, and burst through the surface of the
 liquid, spreading a pungent smell ; the fire must be slackened,
 the liquor stirred, and the operation more carefully attended to.
 This accident was common thtee years ago, but by following the
 aforesaid process it is now become very rare.                   If the boiling
 mass swells, rises, and froths, it may be moderated by putting
 into     a small piece of butter, or
          it-                                   slackening the fire.

 means of judging that the operation              going on well are, first,

 taches itself from the skimmer without drawing into threads, and
without adhesioii-; thirdly, when on striking the boiling mass with
the back of the skimmer, the blow sounds dry, as                    struck upon
                                                                            if  it

on taking up some of the froth or the bubbles out of the boil
with the skimmer, the bubbles disappear directly and resolve into
liquid    :this latter character distinguishes the bubbles of the boil
from those of the scum           lastly, we may be satisfied that the
                                      ;
operation has proceeded well,            no traces of black can be per
                                               if
 ceived at the bottom of the boiler, and the surface appears
clean.
     The time proper to terminate the boiling of the syrup may be
known           by
               the following indications     first,     :              by
                                                           dipping the skim
mer into the syrup, and on taking             out again pass the thumb
                                                        it

cluded     ; when       begins to form
                          it              a  thread the operation             far         is
advanced, and then the experiment must be frequently repeated.
The boiling must be discontinued the moment that the thread
breaks dry; in this case the upper part of the broken thread
shrinks towards the fore finger, forming                 screw, and    a   never     is
entirely    lost  in the  mass   that   adheres   to  the   finger.     As  soon

syrup       completed, the fire

 the forms which are denominated lastardes          are filled ;   the cry
 stallization of the sugar immediately begins, and is almost always
 complete the next day; so that in 24 or 48 hours after it is put
 into the forms, these forms may, without inconvenience, be
 placed upon the pots for the melasses to run out.
    A good crystallization is obtained when the surface is dry, the
paste well grained and not syrupy, and when the surface of the
 base of the loaf of sugar cracks and is depressed towards the
 middle, which is known under the technical name of Jhuntain.
     I pass over several minor particulars of the process, which
 would be superfluous, as they are well known to all persons who
 are at all acquainted with the subject; observing, that in order
 that none of the juice may be lost, the scum, the residuum oh
 the filters, and the settlings of the boilers, are all put into a
 lever press, to squeeze out what remains in them.               It is very
 important    that the  juice  be  operated upon    as soon   as   possible
 after it is extracted ; for, if suffered to remain several hours,
 especially when unconcentrated, it undergoes alterations which
 injure the sugar, render its extraction more difficult, and consi
 derably diminish the quantity.
     I shall not dwell long on the process of refining, which is well
known and understood ; I shall only relate the improvements
made in it by those who have been employed in extracting sugar
 from beet. M. de Rosne was the first who proposed to refine
 with alcohol, which is a very expeditious method, and the better
 adapted for the beet-root sugars, as it renders unnecessary a
 number of utensils which are requisite in the old method.              To
 refine with alcohol, the operation must be commenced imme
diately as the melasses begins to run; for if any time is allowed
for the sugar to dry, the melasses which moistens the crystals
thickens, and forms a very hard coat upon the surface of the
 sugar, which the alcohol detaches with great difficulty: accord
 ingly, the moment that the melasses begins to run, the surface
 of the sugar-loaf contained in the form is to be scraped, and a
litre of alcohol at 36 degrees of commerce poured by degrees
over the whole surface, the little orifice of the form being stopped;
 the base of the form is then carefully covered to prevent the
evaporation of the alcohol.       In. two hours the orifice of the form
is opened, and, the alcohol runs into the pot, charged with a
great proportion of .the colouring principle ; the operation may
be repeated with half the quantity of fresh alcohol, and the su
gar is then equal in whiteness to the clayed or fine povvder sugar.
The sugar is then melted and put into the boiler with bullock's              -
blood.      The operation is terminated by either claying or alcoho-
lising it again; but it has. been observed,, that the last-mentioned
process gives the sugar a more heavy look than the other, and
                                D d 2                               render -

 420               On the State  of the Manufactufe
  renders it a little more friable ; for this reason I use alcohol for
  the first operation, and claying for the second.       The alcoholised
  loaves retain the smell of it for some time, which, however, goes
 off by placing them for a short time in a stove, or even on sim
  ple exposure to the open air.      It is necessary to employ alcohol
  concentrated to 36 degrees ; when it is weaker it dissolves a
 portion of sugar. It is not entirely lost, for by distillation it
 may be freed from the melasses, and employed again as before.
 Another method of refining has been proposed, which does not
  appear to me to possess the advantages of the new one just de
  scribed, or even of the old one : it consists in dissolving 100
 parts of raw sugar, and treating it with ten per cent. of charcoal
 and ten whites of eggs.        When the loaf is in the form, they
 cause one and a half per cent. of white syrup to run through.
    Account   of the  Expenses and Product     of a Manufactory       of
                            Sugar from Beet.
     The process I have described appears to me to be the most
 certain, ceconomical, and simple of any that have come within
 my knowledge : and if the price of the sugar produced from it
 is greater than the sugar of commerce brought from the new
 world, it is still a new fact in science, and an object of curiosity
 to society. We shall now give an exact statement of expenses
 and receipts, in order that every one may be able to judge of the
 importance of this new branch of industry.
     The expenses are comprised in the price of the beet, the ma
 nual labour for the extraction of the sugar, the interest of the
 sums spent in forming the establishment, the maintenance of the
-machines, the purchase of fuel, animal charcoal, and other less
 considerable articles.      Beet-root is usually sold at ten francs
 per thousand weight ; at this price the cultivator has hitherto
 met with a reasonable profit, especially when it is raised in suit
 able soil.    By supposing it to be raised in land of a middling
-quality,  but   yet good enough to produce corn, we may calculate
that an acre of ground will produce a crop of beet at the fol
lowing  0 expense   :  -

    We have in this statement charged the whole expense to the
 beet-root, although we have before said that the land appro
 priated to it was sown with corn towards the 15th of October,
 after the beet was gathered ; and we may therefore charge to
 the corn the expense of the two ploughings, of the rent, of the
 taxes, and the manure ; it is consequently evident that the
 amount may be reduced one-third.
    We generally estimate the mean product of an acre of beet at
 20 thousand weight, which fixes the price for the cultivator at
 9 fr. 20 c.j but as the cleansing diminishes the beet as much as
 one-tenth, the 20 thousand weight are reduced to 18, when they
 come to be operated upon : we shall therefore reckon the price
 at 10 fr. per thousand to the manufacturer, always supposing
 that he grows his own beet.
    To ascertain the other expenses, we will suppose that 10 thou
 sand weight of beet-roots are operated upon every day.

   As  we suppose the manufactory to be at work only four months
in  the year, it is proper to assess upon these four months ex
penses  of another nature, such as the interest of the money, the

   The expense of each day, therefore, employed in the con
sumption of 10 thousand weight of beet-root is 200 francs.
   The produce of this 10 thousand is composed of three distinct
                               D  d 3                           parts —

422                On       the   Stale     of the Manufacture
parts — the sugar, the residuum or marc of the beet, and the
melasses.     In general the heet furnishes from three to four per
cent. of raw sugar, and sometimes even from four to five.          The
quantity  varies   according   to  the state  of the weather   and  the
expertness   of  those who work     in the establishment.    Supposing
only. three per cent. is extracted, the 10 thousand weight of
beet will then produce 300 lbs. of raw sugar, which, reckoning
the daily expense of 200 francs, brings the price of the raw sugar
to about 13 sous, or 65 centimes per pound.           Besides the pro
duce of the sugar, there is another which deserves consideration ;
this is the cuttings and the residuum of the beet after the juice
is expressed from it.      The cuttings, as we have before observed,
compose nearly a tenth part of the weight of the beet; they
consist of the tops, the radicles, and the earth that adheres to
them.     On a thousand weight of cuttings, off 10 thousand of
beet, there is at least a good half which is excellent food for
pigs, who are very fond of it. The residuum or marc is a stiH
more important article: supposing 70 per cent. of juice to be
extracted, the 10 thousand weight daily consumed furnishes
 1500 kilogrammes, or about 30 quintals, of marc, which is a very
valuable food for horned cattle.       This food, which is nearly dry,
has none of the inconveniences of herbs or aqueous roots, or of
cjry fodder ; it produces no putrefaction like the first, and does
not heat them, or occasion obstructions, like the latter ; it con
tains almost all the nutritive principles of the beet, being de
prived of only about 60 per cent. of water, three of sugar, and
a little extract and gelatine ; oxen, cows, and poultry are very
fond of     it,
             and  it fattens them better than any other food; sheep
and milch cows that are fed with          give much more milk, and of
                                              it
an excellent quality.      Thus   an  establishment  of the magnitude
of the one    I am speaking of, may fatten annually from 50 to 60
oxen, or from four to five hundred sheep, with the residuum
only.   .

sand weight of beet will produce nearly 240 pounds, which may
be sold afthe rate of ten or fifteen francs the quintal, or the
fifty kilogrammes; or       may be retained to be fermented and di
                             it
stilled in order to extract the alcohol. When the melasses      kept is
for distillation, it   diluted with water till the liquor marks from
                       is
seven to nine degrees;          then carefully mixed with yeast, or
                                  it   is
the leaven of barley paste, tempered with warm water, in the
proportion of two pounds of the first-mentioned to ten quintals
of liquid, and six pounds of the last -mentioned.         The vessels
that contain the fermenting liquor should be placed in a stove,
where the heat    is constantly from sixteen to eighteen degrees of
the centigrade thermometer;        the fermentation soon appears,
                                                                  and

and is terminated in a few days.          The distillation should be
effected in the improved alembic of Adam and Bernard, then
the alcohol has no bad taste, and it can be obtained to any de
sired degree by a single distillation. This alcohol has the pe
culiarity of being infinitely more pungent than any other at the
same degree of concentration.         One hundred litres of melasses
give nearly 33 litres of alcohol at 22 degrees.         Before the re
siduum is given to the cattle it may be fermented by diluting it
with a sufficient quantity of water, and distilling it afterwards ;
by this means about four per cent. of alcohol may be extracted
from it ; but this operation requires a degree of manipulation
that induced me to abandon it; nevertheless, it gave rise to an
observation that may be useful to be known to persons engaged
in the same object.      1 had conceived the idea of passing water
over the residuum, and using it afterwards to temper the me-
lasses ; this lixiviated water marked from two to four degrees; I
proceeded afterwards to the fermentation in the usual manner ;
 the fermentation proceeded with facility ; when it had terminated
 I submitted the liquor to distillation, and was surprised to find
that it yielded less alcohol, and that towards the end of the ope
 ration the liquor expanded or swelled, and passed from the boiler
 into the worm. I was soon convinced that the melasses had
 not participated in the fermentation, that it had remained un
 disturbed, and that only the lixivium of the residuum had fer
 mented.      This experiment, several times repeated, afforded al
 ways the same results : it appears that the melasses mixes with
 out combining with the water of the lixivium, which ferments first,
 and stops the motion of the melasses.        The ashes of the marc
 or dregs will furnish nearly one per cent. of potash.
                            General Remarks.
     We    see by the above details, that France is able to manufac
 ture, at a low price, as much sugar as is necessary for home
 consumption.       But there are still two or three questions neces
 sary to be examined,     in order  that nothing may be left undone
 in a matter of so much importance.
     1st. Whether the sugar made from beet-root is of the same
 nature with that of the cane ?
     2d. What advantages may be derived to agriculture from
 establishments for the extraction of sugar from beet-root ?
     3d. Whether it is the interest of France to manufacture this
  sugar ?
     4th. From what reason have most of the establishments
  erected for this purpose been given up ?
     In regard to the first question ; whether the sugar made from
  lieet is of the same nature with that of the cane, I shall observe,
                                D  d 4                             that

424                On the State        of the Manufacture
that we are at this time acquainted with three distinct kinds of
sugar, all susceptible of yielding alcohol by fermentation, but
each differing in particular properties : one is uniformly in a li
quid state, another is always a powder incapable of crystalliza-i
tion, and the third is composed of very regular crystals. The
first kind, or liquid sugar, exists mostly in vegetables and fruit ;
it constitutes the syrup when the juice is properly concentrated
by evaporation.
     Thesecond sort       is firm and dry, but without being susceptible
of crystallization:       the sugar of the grape is of this species, as
well as that of honey,'and that which is produced from the adul
teration of starch by sulphuric acid.
   The third kind is susceptible of crystallization ; and the cry
stals take the form of a tetraedral prism, terminated by a diedral
summit.     This species is found in the sugar-cane, the beet-root,
in  the  sugar-maple, the chesnut, &c.         This sort is the most
esteemed and the most sought for, because it has the plea-
santest taste, is sweetest in proportion to the weight, is the
most easily used, and is the most agreeable to the sight.
    There is now not the least doubt among enlightened men as
to the perfect identity of the different sugars that constitute the
third sort ; and when the sugars are brought, by the process of
refining, to the same degree of whiteness and purity, the most
experienced can detect no difference in them.
   Undoubtedly,      when in the first attempts of the manufacture
the sugar produced from beet-root was frequently sent into the
market burnt,     illprepared, and badly refined, the consumer had
reason to reject    it,and found     very different from the sugar of
                                       it
Hamburgh     or  Orleans    but
                             ;  even  then the well-informed ranked
it in the same species, and attributed the difference to the im
perfections of an infant process, rather than to the nature of the
principles.     Long since our celebrated colleague, M. Haiiy,
had proved that the form of the crystals was the same             ;  se
veral establishments had exhibited results analogous to those of
the colonies ;   and     was natural to conclude that the same per
                        it
fection would be gradually attained            all. We know that at
                                               by
all times woollen cloths have been manufactured of the same
materials, and that yet the cloths of the tenth century were by
no means comparable with those of the eighteenth — we know  :
that every art has its period of infancy, but that in the present
age this infancy    isof shorter duration,      reason of the progress
                                                by
of knowledge.
    That which was predicted has taken place         ; and in less than
 two years the manufacture         wonderfully improved
                                   is                       j

uniform results : thus the product of the beet-root establishments
is circulated in commerce without opposition, and the consumer
gives the same price for it as for that of the cane of the same
quality.    It has been said that this sugar is lighter than the
cane sugar, and consequently that the same quantity in bulk
does not sweeten so much: trifling as this accusation           can      is,
                                                                           I
 not admit     it
                ;  employ
                    I      the same   forms  as  those used  at  Chv
leans, and each furnishes    loaf exactly of the same weight as in
                                   a
the refineries of Orleans.
    For three years    have used at my own table no other sugar
                          I
 than that of my own manufactory; and my friends, who had no
 suspicion of       it,
                   have seldom failed to compliment me on the
 beauty and good quality of this sugar.
  I  have already observed, that the sugar refined                  by
                                                             alcohol ex

                                                                     if  it    is
to market immediately the consumer will reasonably complain of
it; but this no defect in the sugar,
                is                                the fault of the pro
                                                 it   is
prietor,  who  should  not  offer    for sale
                                            itbefore   the smell of the
alcohol   is gone off.  Thus      have Ishown   that  the sugar of beet
root and that of the cane are strictly of the same nature, and
that no difference can be found in them.
   As to the second question, whether agriculture can derive any
advantage from the establishments for extracting sugar from
leet, I  reply, that agriculture must unavoidably derive great ad
vantage from them, for whatever tends to vary the crops, and
augment their number,         beneficial to
                                  is              in this view therefore
                                                 it   :
the culture of the beet-root      advantageous; for besides affording
                                       is
an intermediate crop,        doubles the product of the funds, and
                              it
 does not cause the loss of a single grain of corn.         The cultiva
tion of the beet-root also renders the soil more light, and clears
it  of weeds. The manufacture of the sugar                not less useful
                                                               is
than the cultivation of the plant.       First, the residuum or marc
of the beet affords food for the horned cattle and pigs of a large
farm for four winter months, November, December, January and
February. Supposing France contains two hundred manufac
tories, each working upon ten thousand weight of beet-root daily,
the marc or residue from them will fatten from ten to twelve thou
sand oxen, and from two to three thousand pigs. Secondly, these
manufactories have the advantage of employing the horses and
men of    a farm duiing the dead season, and of giving work to
others, who during these four months would otherwise be con
demned to idleness.      Independent of the men employed in the
cultivation of the plant, the cutting and the extraction of the
sugar may employ from five to six thousand persons during the
winter, supposing two hundred establishments to be at work.
                                                                                     To

 426             On the State   of the Manufacture
   To the third question, whether it is the interest of France to
multiply these manufactories, I may answer, that France cau
have no other interest than that of her inhabitants ; conse
quently, whatever augments the mass of labour, or multiplies the
productions of the earth and of industry, and enriches the agri
culturist, must merit protection on the part of the government.
In this place, the great consideration of the colonies presents
itself, and I do not pretend to resolve a question of such high     -
importance ; I shall confine myself on this subject to the state
ment of a few remarks, which I submit to the wisdom of govern
ment, and to men more competent to decide than myself.            I
shall not say, with some writers, that the colonial system does
not interest the nation, under the pretext that the colonies
bring nothing into the public treasury, that they require the sup
port of a very expensive marine, &c. I know that the colonies
open a market for the products of our industry and of our soil,
that they supply our manufactories with raw materials, and that
they give great activity to commerce. Under all these relations,
the colonies have hitherto been one of the principal sources of
public prosperity; but if all these advantages can be obtained
in the bosom of France itself, if the iudigenous fabrication of
sugar and indigo can replace the sugar and indigo of the new
world, at the same price and of the same quality; if this new
branch of industry augments the mass of labour among ourselves,
and enriches our agriculture, without depriving us of any of its
products ; it is evident that there remain against the colonies,
without compensation for any superior interests, the annual ex
pense which they occasion, and the numberless chances of war,
which all at once sacrifice our fortunes, and force us to priva
tions, when a formidable marine is unable to obtain dominion,
or at least equality, upon the seas.      These reasons might be
strengthened by looking at the actual state of the colonies : but
God forbid that 1 should pretend to turn the attention of go
vernment from an interest equally great to the metropolis, and
from its paternal solicitude for the unhappy colonists who have
been despoiled of their property ! I only desire, that at the pre
sent moment the establishments of indigenous sugar may be en
couraged, so that, their products being upon an equal footing
with those of the colonies, we may share with foreigners the
commercial relations which are limited to the exchange of our
colonial commodities, especially sugar, against the productions
of their foil. This becomes the more important, as our prin
cipal trade with Hamburgh and the northern countries consists
of colonial commodities, for which we receive wood for building,
metal, potash, hemp, flax, and tallow; and that when these

    Persons who form       superficial judgement of the arts, are per
                             a
suaded that the manufactories of sugar from heet cannot support
a competition with those of the cane, and they are now con
firmed in their opinion by the failure of so many of the esta
blishments that were formed before the peace.               To this we
might reply, that       it  sufficient
                             is        that  some  of them  still remain,
notwithstanding the importation of foreign sugar, to prove that
our manufactories are capable of rivalling them but              prefer in
                                                                  ;   I
this place to point out the causes of the failure, and to establish
certain principles which may serve to guide those persons who
may in future undertake to form fresh establishments.
    When the extraction of sugar from beet-root was at first de
sired, the government excited the zeal of all France                  by
                                                                  the en
couragement    it offered     every where the beet was sown, and
                                 :
numerous establishments were formed, without any previous
consideration on the nature of the soil, the expense of the culti
vation, or the saccharine quality of the root.            Vast buildings
were erected at great expense, graters and presses were bought,
                   a
the effects of which were not understood             and frequently the
                                                             ;
whole   made   ready   to set  to  work,  without the  least mistrust of
the process intended to be followed            and sometimes even un
                                                         ;
provided with      man capable of conducting the operations.
                   a
   The rational progress of a new branch of industry was not at
tended to, great losses were suffered, and they might have been
expected.     In some places the beet was found to contain no
sugar   when it  was operated upon        this was the cause of the fall
                                               ;
of all the establishments in the south in others, defective pro
                                                         ;
cesses were employed, and only syrup could be extracted               and  ;
the cultivation or purchase of the beet has cost so muchi that
the product has not balanced the expense.             This inconsiderate
mode of proceeding was necessarily the ruin of most of the un
dertakings     and as every one        apt to reason from his own ex
                                            a is
           ;
perience,  whether    good  or  bad,   general prejudice soon prevailed
against   the  success   of  this  manufacture.     On the other hand,
the bad quality of the sugar which some manufacturers sent to
market, has contributed, in no small degree, to disgust the con
sumer.
    It would doubtless have been better to have sought out the
causes of failure, and to have studied the methods of the pro
sperous establishments        but public opinion
                                  :                   not always so just,

  428     On the Stale  of the Manufacture of Sugar in     France.
  proscribes it without reason.       Neverthelesss the repeated at
  tempts in every part of France have afforded results by which
  some have profited, and have at length furnished us with a po
  sitive knowledge of the culture of the beet-root, of its product,
  and with a certain, easy, and ceconomica! method of extracting
  the sugar from it.     Experience has also taught us, that the ma
  nufactories of sugar from beet-root can only prosper in the hands
  of proprietors who cultivate the plant themselves, and consume
  the residue upon their own demesne : indeed, it is only necessary
  to take a view of the advantages which this manufacture affords,
 when connected with a large farm, to be convinced of the great
  difference in the two cases.
     First.   The proprietor who cultivates the beet, obtains it at
 a lower price than he who buys it : this difference is immense ;
 especially if we consider, that as it is an intermediate crop, the
 expense of ploughing and manuring may be laid upon the crop
 of corn that succeeds it.
     Secondly.    The residue of the beet will feed nearly all the
 horned cattle of a large demesne, during the four severest months
 of the year ; whereas if sold it does not produce half the benefit.
     Thirdly.    The carriage, and most of the operations, may be
 executed by the horses and men belonging to the farm ; while,
 in the other case, all these must be paid for this purpose solely,
 and for a limited time, which increases the disadvantage.
     Fourthly. Manual labour is dearer in towns than in the country.
     Fifthly.   Fuel is always dearer in towns than in the country,
 especially wood, which may be employed in some of the opera
 tions.
     This new branch     of industry,  therefore, must he established
on extensive property, for on such only it can succeed.         Inde
pendent of the advantages of situation, we may add, that the
erections necessarily depending on a large farm will mostly suf
fice, without any further expense, for the purposes of the new
manufacture.       I could mention two establishments of this nature,
which required no more additional buildings than amounted to the
expense of 300 francs.       These establishments are in a prosperous
state at this moment, and are about to commence their fifth
 year.
     The large proprietor, accustomed hitherto to easy harvests,
will probably feel unwilling to undertake this new system, be
cause he may imagine himself not sufficiently acquainted with
it : but if he considers that all the expense of experiments has
been incurred by others ; that the processes we have described
are easy and certain ; that the calculations, being deduced from
experience, are accurate ; that the distilleries of grain and po
tatoes, which are formed in almost all the northern farms, re

quire information equally extensive, without affording     so much
advantage ; since, besides the food for cattle,   and  the  product
of the alcohol, which is more abundant from beet-root than from
grain, we have also the production of the sugar ; he will see, that
he may at the same time improve his land, and assist to enrich
the country with a product which has become one of the first
necessity.
  LXXXVIII.      On Aerial Navigation.      By John Evans, Esq.
                                 \
                           To Mr.   Tilloch.
Sir, —    I   am much gratified at finding that my paper Inserted
in your Magazine for November last has given rise to some able
communications in your subsequent numbers.         My engagements
at the College of Edinburgh during the past winter will, I trust,
prove a sufficient apology for my apparent neglect in not noticing
them at an earlier period.
    The claim of priority of invention urged by Mr. Edgeworth
 I am perfectly willing to admit, but must at the same time en
tirely disclaim all knowledge of any experiments in which the
inclined plane was proposed as the means of directing balloons.
 Sir George Cayley's papers in Nicholson's Journal were equally
unknown to me.
    Sir George's paper in your number for February commences
with mentioning a difficulty attending the method by which I
had proposed to apply the action of the inclined plane.         The
plane being merely suspended below the balloon, would during
the descent be urged by its own weight only, and consequently
would not receive an adequate resistance from the air. This
difficulty, however, may be easily obviated by fixing the plane
close beneath the gallery (taking due precautions as to safety
from fire), and thus making the weights of the balloon and plane
act in conjunction. The sole reason of my placing the plane so
far below the balloon was to allow the air to reoccupy the par
tial vacuum which might be formed beneath the latter whilst
ascending, and tend to render the effect of the inclined plane
less complete.     But if the plane be firmly attached to the in
ferior part of the balloon as now proposed, a very slight elonga
tion of the diagonal yards will allow the expansion of an addi
tional quantity of canvass sufficient to compensate the loss of re
sistance occasioned by the proximity of the balloon.
    Sir G. afterwards gives another mode of applying the same prin
ciple, which, it is rather remarkable, is almost the same as I tried
last summer, and to which 1 alluded in the last paragraph of
                                    •
                                                                 my

430                    On      Aerial Navigation.
  my former paper.         I do not mention this circumstance with the
  view    of   questioning the originality of Sir George's idea, but
  nierelv because it may be iuseful, in the prosecution of further
  experiments, to know what constructions have been already ex
  amined, and what difficulties have impeded their execution.
      It appears a very obvious improvement to make the balloon
  itself furnish the required oblique surface as well as the moving
  power. In proceeding to submit this to experiment, the first ques
  tion that offered itself was, what should be the shape of the bal
  loon in order to obtain the oblique surface most conveniently?
  From previous experiments, I was well acquainted with the dif
  ficultv of distending the balloon by framework however lightly
  made.        I therefore sought some shape which should not require
  such assistance, but be such that the balloon could not assume
  any other figure without diminishing its capacity.           The shape
  of the first balloon constructed with this view,       was  that of two
  flattened hexagonal pyramids united by their bases.           The bal
  loon when inflated did not perfectly retain the above figure, but
  became rounded at all the corners and bounding lines.               The
  aperture for the fire was not at the apex of the inferior pyramid,
 but on one side of  it,     and a weight was attached which might be
  adjusted so as to keep the balloon at the requisite obliquity.
 The balloon was elevated in the room where made the experi I
 ments detailed in my former paper, but no sensible effect was
 observed.         Being afterwards launched        the open air with
                                                      in                  a
.small side sail attached,     it assumed the same rotatory motion as
 a balloon furnished with an inclined plane.
     In this experiment much inconvenience arose from the constant
 tendency of the hot air to ascend to the higher extremity of the
 balloon, which was consequently always endeavouring to attain
 a perpendicular position.          It  much to be feared that this cir
                                         is
 cumstance would be        a    material obstacle to the success of bal
 loons constructed after this plan on           large scale; which con
                                                  a
 sideration inclined me to prefer       the original method of suspend
 ing the plane at some distance below a spherical balloon.           The
 experiments on the comparative advantages of the two construc
 tions are however at present too few and imperfect to warrant            a
 decision as to the superiority of either of them.
     Sir George in his last paper gives a description of        hydrogen
                                                                      a
 gas balloon furnished with wings or oars, which are to be moved
 alternately up and'down       by   steam -engine.
                                    a                 appears to me that

 bya     force being communicated to these wings in one direction,
which force   is      almost immediately destroyed in order to give an
 impulse      in  the contrary direction,    considerable loss of power
                                              a
must be occasioned.        I    would therefore beg leave to suggest
that  a     large wheel with oblique vanes (like the         of fly
                                                                  smoke

 rection would attain the desired object, with no more waste of
 power than what would arise from the additional machinery ne
 cessary to obtain a rotatory motion from the steam-engine.
     Well knowing that the further advancement of this interest
 ing subject must depend on the united exertions of the friends
 to science, I shall with pleasure enroll my name in the list of
 subscribers for the completion of so desirable an object.

 LXXXIX.        On   the Cosmogony     of Moses.      By Dr. Prichard;
                          in Reply   to F. E        s.
                              To Mr.    Tilloch.
 Sir, —     I  am sorry to find myself under the necessity of tres
 passing upon your patience, by once more directing your atten
 tion to the Cosmogony of Moses.
     I shall make but a few remarks on the last letter of your cor
  respondent F. E          s.  It contains nothing new except a tirade
  about torches and a chateau en Espagne, from which I can un
  derstand nothing except that the writer intends to be facetious.
  I wish that his method of treating the points in controversy were
  equally novel and. ingenious, and that he had not contented him
  self with repeating the same objections to which I have before,
  as I trust, sufficiently replied.     He is still determined to find
-contradictions between propositions which have no relation to
  each other, and quarrels even with the words in which they are
  expressed.     I shall not stay to notice mere cavils, but shall con
  tent myself with a specimen of the mode of reasoning adopted
  by this pertinacious critic.                 ' ..
     In my last paper I hinted at the instance of St. Matthew and
  St. Luke, in order to prove that inspired writers have chosen to
' avail themselves of historical documents when such sources of
  information were to be found.          Mr. F. E. seems to allow the
  force of this example, but denies that it leads to any inference
  with respect to Moses; and the exception he takes against it is
  to the following purport.       St. Matthew and St. Luke found pre
  existing documents, which it only required in them human sa
  gacity to adopt ; but Moses, it seems, had nothing but the light
  of revelation to guide him : consequently he made no use of re
  cords.    Now there is one grand objection to this conclusion ;
                                                                    viz.

  432                 On the Cosmogony       of Moses,
 viz. that it takes for granted the chief thing intended            to foe
 proved.
     I here beg to disclaim the merit kindly ascribed to me foy
 F. E       s, of having formed an
                                          " ingenious imagination" re
  specting sorts of inspiration, and to enter a protest at the same
  time against the pretensions of those who, like that writer, talk
  largely of
               " circuitous inspirations" and " immediate inspira
  tions." Such knowing persons indeed would be very great
  prizes in these iron times, if we could be sure that their in
  formation is genuine; but until they point out the sources whence
  it was derived, we must be excused from paying deference to
  their superior attainments.      I am such a tyro in these matters,
  that I cannot even see any force or shadow of meaning in the
  objection advanced by F. E            s against my former positions,
  and founded by him on the supposed sort of inspiration which
  is to be ascribed to Moses.      Far be it from me to pronounce
  the particular time, place, and manner in which the most an
  cient revelations were made, or " to ascertain the person fa
  voured with them,'," nothing less than which, it seems, will sa
  tisfy my unrelenting inquisitor.        I have no one opinion or hy
  pothesis  on  the  subject, but  leave   all such sublime matters to
, F.  E      s and  the  winged folk   of  Aristophanes :
                                  TOif aWeowif,
.while I take up my humble place among the             a%Tr,ve; efqpi^Mt,
  the unfledged mortals who are doomed to grope upon the sur
  face of the earth, and see but a short space before them.            My
  reason for believing that Moses was not the original author of
 the Cosmogony, is not any speculative opinion concerning sub
 jects beyond my comprehension, but the fact that the same re
  cord is found among distant nations, whose history has been to
  tally unconnected, from a period long antecedent to the age of
  Moses ; and I presume that one fair inference from historical
  facts will weigh down a hundred hypotheses concerning sorts
 of inspiration.
     But although I do not pretend to be so sagacious as F. E             s
 in occult matters, I am far from intending to depreciate the cha
 racter of Moses.       His writings display a mind so free from those
 prejudices    which  enslaved  the greatest philosophers in the most
 enlightened ages     of antiquity, that the extent of his wisdom ap
 pears quite out of the course of nature.             His freedom from
 superstition is the more astonishing, if it be true, as the Egyptian
 historians assert, that Moses was originally a priest of Heliopolis.
     I have not, as Mr. F. E          s would insinuate, rested my in
terpretation of the word day on the authority of Josephus and
                                                                   Philo.

                    On the Cosmogony     of Moses.               433
Philo.   Yet as it has Been ray endeavour to show that every
part of the first chapter of Genesis is more or less metaphorical,
I do not perceive how the figurative     sense imputed to the whole
of it   by those writers   can be represented as wholly foreign to
my purpose.      At any rate it is quite " obvious to ordinary un
derstandings," that the opinions of two such writers as Josephus
and Philo should be taken into the account by a critic who pre
tends to estimate the notions entertained bv the Hebrew people,
and to rest on them the chief stress of his argument.
     I shall not enter further into the inquiry what place corals
and bivalves hold in the scale of creation, whether they are, as
F. E — — s declares, locomotive animals, or approach to the cha
racter of vegetables.     The question has been decided in my fa
vour by a third person unprejudiced in behalf of either party,
who has shown himself to be perfectly well informed respecting
the points in controversy.       In fact, it is impossible that any
thing can be said more clear and satisfactory than the remarks
of Mr. Horn in the 341st page of your last number. -
      I must now advert to the strictures of Mr. Horn upon some
parts of my last paper ; and I shall be brief, as I do not feel
myself particularly interested in the question which they involve.
Before Mr. Horn passes a peremptory sentence upon the opi
nions of Michaelis, I wish he would take the trouble to consider
and refute the arguments of that profoundly learned writer, and
to furnish some other explanation of the facts from which his
conclusions seem to follow as fair inferences.      I confess that  I
have been accustomed to consider the opinions of Michaelis as
indisputable ; but if Mr. Horn can enable me to think otherwise,
I shall become a willing convert to his doctrine. When Mr. H.
has vanquished the German professor, he may find some amuse
ment in disposing of our obstinate countryman Dr. Middleton,
who has displayed profound erudition and a most vigorous in
 tellect in defence of similar opinions.     For the present, I hope
to be excused if I understand the- texts which Mr. H. has cited,
 in a more limited sense than that which he has affixed to them.
  I beg however to assure him, that I have no design to insinuate
 that Moses borrowed his account of the creation from the Egyp
 tians.    I doubt not that the primitive traditions were preserved
 in greater purity by the Hebrews than by any other nation of
  antiquity ; — neither do I intend to impute to the whole Hebrew
 nation so superstitious a notion as anthropomorphism.            The
 vulgar were anthropomorphites,      as probably are many ignorant
  persons in every country: but   if,  cannot he doubted that well-
  informed and philosophical men interpreted the passages pointed
 out    byMr. Horn in a figurative manner; and was for the sake

  Hindoos and the Etruscans, have preserved this same document of

 difference, that where Moses mentions " days," they expressly
 define kmg periods of time or ages. This                   precisely that very

Sir,—       The proposition to publish     Meteorological Journal

induces me to offer    few remarks on the subject.

   As no precise outline of the plan has been brought forward,                           it
may be inferred that the new work       intended to collect testi
                                                   is

                            On Meteorology.                        435
 mollies from a variety of places in this empire, and in foreign
 countries, relative to the barometer, thermometer, wind, and
 weather^ at particular periods.      If it be also in contemplation
 to specify agreeably to the excellent classification of Luke Ho*
 ward, Esq. the Various clouds preceding or coincident with the
 Changes of the weather, I shall not dispute the utility of such re
 cords ; but since the effects produced in our glassesi the iluctua*
tions of the wind, the varying figures of the clouds, and the
 changes of the weather, are subsequent to some prior causes in
 the operations of Nature^ meteorological records so limited will
 serve only to register what has occurred, without affording any
 presage of what may occur.
    If the philosophers will enlarge the table, and note at the same
 time the situations of the planets, they will probably find in side
 real operations on the atmosphere not only causes prior to the
 above effects, but from the revolutions in the planetary system
 they may by calculation anticipate the probable variations in the
 atmosphere at subsequent periods.
    Pliny speaks" of those who could predict thunder-storms to a
 day. If we are not competent to speak with the same positive-
 hess, it must be ascribed to the fashionable neglect of the sub
ject; If philosophers will cease' to disregard a branch of scienee
 almost exploded; they may in time acquire the accuracy of                  \
judgement to which Pliny alludes.
    I consider it unquestionable, that at certain positions of the
 planets snow or rain never fails to occur.
    From the want of a greater number of modern testimonies
 founded on observation, the incertitude at the period of other
 positions is great.   There   is,perhaps, less reason for eonfidencfe
in an island than on   a  continent, and the variety of weather may
 be greater near the sea coast than in an inland county       t  but   if
 the gentlemen think proper to prosecute their plan with such
 additional remarks, they may be expected to relumiue the lamp
 of the ancients^ and probably obtain for us some new light on
 the subject.
  A     lespectable philosopher of the present day has given an
 opinion on this subject, and beg leave to question that opinion^
                               1
 and to note an apparent inconsistency combined with it.
  I   presume the gentleman as       philosopher has no object but
                                     a
 the development of truth. He      will not find in me disrespectful
                                                       a
"opponent but, as the work to which
          ;                                  allude may be supposed

 by some readers to militate against the hypothesis        I   am at
 tempting to maintain, he will excuse my quoting         a  passage in
 his publication " Researches about Atmospheric Phaenomena."
    " The old notions astrologers about tlie conjunctions
                       of                                         of the

certain the place of the moon has some influence                  oil the
weather*        That changes of weather oftener take place about the
 full and new moon, and about the quadratures, than at other
 times, is really a fact founded on long observation."
     I apprehend that the moon in conjunction with, or in opposi
tion to, the sun, are two data whence the old notions of the astro
logers were formed ; and if the quadratures may be considered
productive of any variations in the atmosphere, the moon's posi
 tion with respect to the sun appears to be the only rational
 mode of accounting for them.
     If Mr. Forster should be induced to consider the operations of
 Saturn, Jupiter, &c. possible, he will most probably be con
 vinced that the variations in the atmosphere are not dependent
 solely on the moon.

                              the last year the surgeons of our dif
 ferent stations in London have vaccinated 6,581 persons, and
 have distributed to the public 32,82 1 charges of vaccine lymph.
We cannot state precisely what the sixty-eight honorary and
 corresponding vaccinators may have effected in the country, as
 returns are not always sent : however, we have ascertained that
 those practitioners whom we have supplied with lymph have
 vaccinated 42,667 in the course of the year.
     We have the satisfaction of informing your lordship, that we
 have furnished the means of disseminating this blessing in the
 island of St. Domingo ; and that the director has received the
 annexed letter from the government of Hayti on that subject.
     It is equally gratifying to us to state, that bv the ingenuity of
 Mr. Giraud of Faversham, means have been devised of preserving
 the lymph in a fluid state ; by which we have just reason to hope
 that it may be found efficient in any climate, and for any space
 of time.

   of the decisive measures adopted in Russia, Sweden, Ger.many,
   France and Italy, the small-pox has become a very rare disease
   Sn those countries } and that, by like means, It is no longer
  known in Ceylon and at the Cape of Good Hope. It is a source
  of sincere regret to us, that it should not be equally so in this
   kingdom ; and still more so, as this is not attributable to the
   casual occurrence of that disease ; but, we believe, entirely tt5 the
  practice of inoculation, which seems to be adhered to on in
   terested or mistaken motives.
      In Edinburgh, Glasgow and Norwich, Inoculation is disused;
  and, in consequence, the small-pox is scarcely known. In the
  country about Aberystwith in Wales, and Bawtry in Yorkshire, it
  has entirely disappeared.       The reverse is found unhappily to be
  the case in Portsmouth, Bristol and London.           In the metropolis
  alone, the mortality by small-pox may be estimated at a thou
  sand annually: perhaps throughout the United Kingdom it is
  not less than ten times that number.
      We beg to conclude by stating, that it appears to us, this
  waste of human life can be prevented only by such legislative
  enactments as will entirely put a stop to inoculation for the
  small-pox.
      The Board is happy in stating, that it has no occasion to ask
  Parliament this year for any sum of money beyond that usually
  granted,

XCII.     Essay towards    a  natural Classification   of simple  Bodies*
                           By M. Ampere*.
w ken       the arbitrary hypotheses which had long led chemists
         were  banished from science, and it was ascertained that
astray
we were to consider as simple, all the bodies which had not yet
been decomposed, the number of these bodies was not two-
thirds of what they are now : this number successively increased
as the processes of chemical analysis were applied to compounds
which had not yet been analysed, or which had been so but im
perfectly.    Every time that a new simple body was discovered,
a further term of comparison was obtained, and new relations
were observed : it became necessary sometimes to restrain, and
sometimes to generalize, the first views of the fathers of modern
 chemistry ; and the want of arranging simple bodies in an order
which renders more sensible their mutual relations,. and facilitates
the study of their properties, became more and more felt.             This
order may be purely artificial, like the systematic classifications,
 which were at first resorted to in the other branches of the na
 tural sciences: it may also be deduced from the ensemble of the
 characters of the bodies which we propose to classify ; and by
 constantly uniting those presented by the most numerous and
 essential analogies, they will be to chemistry what the natural
 methods are to botany and zoology.

                  Classification of simple   Bodies.            439
    Hitherto chemists have confined themselves to ranging simple
bodies according to the degree of their affinity for oxygen, and
the nature of the combinations which they form with it.        They
ought naturally to have adopted this kind of classification, when
they thought that the properties which characterized the oxygen
belonged to it in a manner so exclusive that no other body could
be associated with it.      But nowadays that new facts, and a
more accurate interpretation of the facts already known, have
rectified whatever was too absolute in the theory established by
the celebrated Lavoisier ; and now that other substances have
presented similar properties ; it appears to me that we must of
necessity banish from chemistry the artificial classifications, and
begin by assigning to each simple body the place which it ought
to occupy in the natural order, by comparing it successively with
all the rest, and uniting it with those which resemble it by a
greater number of common characters, and particularly by the
importance of those characters.      The first advantage which will
result from tye employment of such a method, will be to give us
a more exact and more complete knowledge of all the properties
of simple bodies ; and frequently to refer to general laws a mul
titude of isolated facts.   Another advantage will arise from this,
namely, that after having ascertained among those which we
shall have thus united, analogies so multiplied that we cannot
refuse to regard them as connected very closely in the natural or
der, we shall be led to try upon some, experiments similar to those
which have been attempted with success on others.         A classifi
cation, which should have induced every person from the very
origin of modern chemistry to consider all the salifiable bases as
belonging to one and the same class of bodies, would have taught
chemists to place potash and soda in contact with iron at a high
 temperature, and potash and soda would have been discovered
 twenty years sooner.     When it was ascertained that chlore was
a simple body, it was at first compared to oxygen ; and it was
 only when M. Gay-Lussae remarked its analogies with sulphur,
 that he was led to a discovery, the consequences of which upon
 the ulterior progress of chemistry can only as yet be guessed at,
 viz, that of the chloric and iodic acids, and of the perfect ana
logy of the chlorates and iodates with the nitrates.       A second
 approximation followed almost instantly by another discovery
to which it naturally led, that of cyanogene, and of the true na
 ture of the hydrocyanic acid.        Finally, these very analogies
 doubtless guided M. Dulong      in  the  work which he communi
  cated to the Institute on the 7th of November IS 15, in which
 we see that the oxalic acid is composed of carbonic acid gas and
 hydrogen gas combined in the ratio of two to one in volume j that

this acid, which he calls in consequence hydro-carbonic acid, con
formably to the established nomenclature, is united with the
oxides in such a proportion, that the volume of hydrogen which
it contains is double that of the oxygen of the oxide, so that
when the latter is not very difficult to decompose, water is
formed, and the carbonic acid gas remains alone combined with
the metal, as happens with cyanogene, sulphur, chlore and iode, in
the formation of the cyanures,sulphurets, chlorures and iodures.
    A third advantage equally important         is,
                                                to prepare     the na

tural classification of simple bodies, that of compound substances,
— work of much more labour, and to which purpose to devote
     a                                                I
another paper.    I     know that the compound bodies have been
already    classed ina   manner much more conformable to their true
analogies     than  their  elements have been.     Many things have
doubtless been done in this respect    ;  but more perhaps remains
to be done; and the discovery of the new substances with which
the domains of chemistry have been enriched within these few
years, cannot fail to lead to a modification and generalization of
the principles according to which we now class compound sub
stances, and to determine in a more precise manner the signifi
cation of the names which serve to designate the various kinds
of combinations, and particularly that of the words acid, alkali,
salt, &c.
 I    shall confine myself in this paper to the simple bodies, and
shall divide them into three heads.        I  shall offer in the first,
some general considerations on the order according to which
it    proper to arrange bodies, so that this order may be as con
     is
formable as possible to their natural analogies           and on the
                                                          ;
means of avoiding the junction which has been hitherto made of
the metals with bodies very different in almost all their other
characters, and which have only been brought together because
the energy of their affinity for oxygen    isnearly the same, — a cir
cumstance certainly remarkable, but to which perhaps too much
importance has been attached, — and which certain considerations
 on the natural order of simple bodies, the principal results of
which shall soon detail, ought to induce us to regard as se
          I
 condary, when   it     does not concur with other analogies which
 embrace the whole of the properties of the body.
    Under the second head, shall unite under natural genera the
                                   I
 bodies which present characters of resemblance so multiplied
 and important that      it    impossible to separate them in every
                              is
 classification which shall not be purely artificial; and    shall set
                                                              I
 tle at the same time what places ought to be occupied in the
 natural order  by    the simple bodies which seem to form the pas
 sage from one genus to another, presenting analogies very striking
                                                                   with

with substances belonging to two different genera.          In this case,
they   indicate   between   these two  genera  an  analogy which   it will
perhaps be difficult to ascertain without their assistance, but
which is not the less real, and according to which we ought to
place them in succession after each other, so that the body which
establishes the link of the chain is at the end of the first, or the
beginning of the second, in order to be always between two
bodies which they resemble by common characters.                Nothing
then remains but to determine with which of the two genera it
ought to be definitively united, by comparing the properties which
it shares with the one, and those which are common to it with
the other, in order to decide according to the number and im
portance of the analogies which result from these properties.
The analogies to which these researches will lead us, will fix in
an invariable manner the natural order of the simple bodies, con
formably to the general idea which I am about to give of them.
   The last head of this paper will have for its object to examine
once more the various genera into which all these bodies shall
have been distributed according to the data laid down in the
preceding head, in order to assign to each of them a distinctive
character formed by the union of some remarkable properties,
chosen in such a way that they cannot be found at once but in
a body appertaining to the genus which          if is wanted to charac
terize, and to see at the     same  time  according to what principles
of nomenclature we could, if necessary, establish for each genus
a denomination common to all the bodies which form part of it.
§ I. On the impossibility of reconciling the manner in which
   chemists have hitherto ranged simple bodies, and the distinc
   tions which have been established between them; with a
   classification    deduced from the whole of their properties;
   and on the order which it is proper to adopt, to unite as
   much as possible those which present the most characters in
   common.
   The first source of the artificial classifications hitherto used,
seems to me to have arisen from the old distinction of the metals
and non-metallic bodies. I must confess, however, that this di
vision leads us to separate but a very small number of bodies
which we ought to unite in the natural order ; and that it is in
general tolerably conformable to the classification which results
from the comparison of all the properties of bodies ; and that it
will even be sufficient, in order that it may embrace none of the
genera which I regard as natural, to separate from the metals
three substances which are generally united with them, arsenic,
tellurium, and silicium : but then it becomes very difficult to as
sign a character which distinguishes in every case the metals

442                    Essay towards a natural
from the non-metallic bodies.      Those which originally had served
as the basis for this  distinction can no longer be used as such,
since most of the metals hitherto regarded as of that class are
brittle ; and because some have been discovered even lighter than
water ; and iode, and even carbon, when its particles are very
close, as in animal charcoal, present the metallic lustre and a
perfect opacity; and because chemists have discovered in carbon
the property of being a conductor of the electric fluid, &c. A
more important character, viz. that of producing salifiable bases
on being united with oxygen, cannot be considered as sufficient
for characterizing exclusively the metals; because some metals
do net form any, because the boric and the nitrous acids are com
bined with the sulphuric acid, and because the products of those
 combinations    have all the characters of the acid salts, which
they resemble even more by their easy crystallization than se
veral metallic solutions the oxide of which is precipitated in pro
portion as they are evaporated ; solutions which are only consi
dered as salts, precisely because they are compounded of an acid
 and of the oxide of a body which we have been accustomed to
regard as a metal.      This character, which is admitted besides
 as exclusive, will remove tellurium from arsenic, and particularly
from iode; whereas the far more important property which it
 possesses of forming with hydrogen a permanent acid gas places
it necessarily between those two bodies. The first object to
 which I shall turn my attention in the following article, will be
to examine to what extent wc might preserve the distinction of
 the metals, and of the non-metallic bodies, by subjecting the
 character which we shall choose for defining it in a precise man
ner, to the modification required by the necessity of rendering it
 conform to the natural order of simple bodies.        I shall confine
myself to remarking, that in the way in which it has been ad
 mitted, it has retarded the progress of the true theory of che
mistry, by inducing a neglect of the observation of the properties
 by which certain metals are connected with the other simple
 bodies, and to which we cannot pay too much attention, when it
 in required to ascertain the truly natural order which exists be
 tween both the one and the other.        The character drawn from
 the various degrees of affinity has still more contributed to esta
 blish between bodies, and particularly between the metals, ap
 proximations    disavowed by nature.      I shall confine myself to
 quoting in this respect,   an  example   which  appears to me very
 striking. Silver and gold form equally with oxygen combina
 tions which an elevated temperature easily decomposes: from
 that instance those two metals have been regarded as being en
 titled to be placed very near each other in every methodical ar
 rangement of simple bodies.       Nevertheless the degree of affinity
                                                                    for

                      Classification   of simple Bodies.              443
for chlore ought not, in the        eyes of the chemist who has precise
ideas as to the action, equally energetic at least with that of oxy
gen, which it exercises on the metals, to be regarded as a cha
racter less important than the degree of affinity for oxygen; and
the chlorure of gold is decomposable by heat; whereas that of
silver, kept free from the contact of water and hydrogen, is ab
solutely unalterable at the highest temperature.
     Here therefore we have two motives nearly equal, one for
uniting and the other for separating these bodies.             In order to
re .solve this difficulty, it is indispensable to have recourse to other
properties; those of their oxides and their salts which they form
with the acids, are then exhibited naturally, and decide the
question, by showing us that the supposed analogy between those
two metals is not confirmed by the resemblance of their principal
 characters.     In fact, the oxide of silver is very alkaline, a little
soluble in water, and completely saturates the acids : the oxide
of gold presents nothing similar: and this difference, added to
some other properties, less important, it is true, which silver
presents in the metallic state, places this body with lead near
potassium and sodium, and consequently very far from gold.
     Since precise notions have been acquired as to the nature of
 ehlore, several chemists have ceased to give to the properties
 which depend on the affinity of simple bodies for oxygen, an ex
 clusive preponderance;         but then one too great has been given
 to the assimilation which has been made of oxygen and of ehlore;
 It has been attempted to arrange all the simple bodies in two
 classes, independent of each other, under the names of combusti
 ble bodies, and suppor iers of combustion.        This division has had
 the   same   inconvenience      with that  of the metals and the non-
 metallic bodies, by making us mistake the analogies of bodies
 which it places in different classes. This inconvenience has
 even been the more injurious to the theory of chemistry, in as
 much as it has taught us to neglect analogies much more com
 plete and more striking than those which the separation of the
 metals and other simple bod:es had caused to be neglected.          Such
 are the analogies of the chloric and iodic acids with the sulphuric
 and nitric acids, of the chlorates and the ioriates with the ni
 trates, and particularly that of chlore and iode with sulphur,
 greater still than the analogy of the same bodies with oxygen!
  The combination of those four substances with the metals to
 which tliey strongly adhere, takes place by occasioning a greater
  or less extrication of heat, and frequently of light : the com
  pounds which result present a crowd of common properties : so
  far there is no occasion to approximate more particularly chlore
  and iode to oxygen than, to sulphur ; but this last forms like

   444                  Essay towards a natural
  iode and chlore a permanent acid gas with hydrogen : the hydro-
  sulphates present the greatest analogy with the hydro-iodates
  and hydro-chlorates: they are reduced into sulphurets, as the
  latter are into iodures and chlorures, when they are insoluble, or
  after having evaporated their solutions, and dried their residues — ••
  properties which still more closely approximate iode and chlore
  to sulphur than to oxygen.         It is impossible to separate iode
  from chlore, from which it differs only because the same cha
  racters are manifested at a less degree of energy; and never
  theless, why should iode be a supporter of combustion rather
  than sulphur, which is united to most of the metals with a greater
  extrication of light and heat ? Shall we say that the sulphur is
  combined with the oxygen of the atmospheric air when we ex
  pose it to a sufficient temperature, and that this is riot the case
  with iode also?     But is the latter not also combined with oxy
  gen when we place it in contact with the gaseous oxide of chlore,
  discovered by the celebrated chemist who was the first to de
  compose the alkalis, and demonstrate that chlore is a simple
   body, conformably to the opinion already given by the French
  chemists as an admissible hypothesis ?         It is of no use to insist
  longer   on considerations of  this  kind : what precedes is sufficient
  to show how easy it is to be led into error, and to give too much
  importance to certain analogies, when we commence by esta
'
  blishing between the bodies which we purpose to classify, general
  divisions founded on a single character only.         We should then
  deceive ourselves still more, if we thought to be able to arrange
  the simple bodies in an order conformable to their natural ana
  logies, by forming of them a series dependent on their various
  degrees of affinity for one of them, for oxygen for instance. On
  comparing all the properties which those substances present, we
  find that they form a system in which every body belongs, on one
  side or the other, to bodies adjoining them, by analogies so
  strong that we are not able to establish in any way the complete
  separation which will be required by the reduction of the system
  into a single series ; so that we must represent it to ourselves as
  a sort of circle, in which two bodies placed at the two extremities
  of the chain formed by all the rest, approach and unite mutually
  by common characters.        I have long endeavoured to establish a
  natural order among simple bodies, by arranging them in a sin
  gle series, which should commence with those whose properties
  presented the most complete opposition to those of the bodies
  which I attempted to place at the end of the series : these at
  tempts have not been attended with any success ; and it is by
  them that I have been led to adopt an order quite different, of
  which I shall in the first place attempt to give a general idea,
                                                                   which

                   Classification  of simple Bodies.              445
Which shall be developed and denned in the two following arti
cles.     The bodies which have been hitherto considered as non-
metallic, all possess the property of forming acids with some
among them, the distinctive character of which is to make acid
all combinations into which they ente.r in sufficient quantity.
Several metals, and even some of those best entitled to this
name, also present this property, and produce acids on being
combined with the same acidifying substances.           Those metals
form two groupes, distinguished besides from each other by nu
merous differences.      Some are eminently fixed and infusible ; and
it seems to be the same case with their combinations with chlore,
at least if we may judge by the chlorure of chrome which presented
 this property to M. Dulong.      It is with oxygen that they produce
 the acids from which the^chemists have drawn the character which
 distinguishes them.      The others are very fusible ; the combina
 tions which they form with oxygen present but feeble acid cha
 racters; for we ought not to reckon among them arsenic, which,
,as I have already said, ought to be united to the bodies which are
.considered as not metallic.      And but for the labours of Messrs.
 Chevreul and Berzelius, the acidity of the peroxides of tin and
 antimony would have been still unknown; but these metals pro
 duce with chlore compounds liquid, or of a butyraceous consist
 ency and volatile, and which possess the most essential properties
 of the acids. It is easy to see that the non-metallic simple
                                                                        *
 bodies are united on the one hand with the infusible metals
 acidifiable by carbon and borium, and on the other with tin
 and antimony by phosphorus and arsenic, the combinations of
 which with chlore have the greatest analogy with the ehloro-
 stannic acid (spiritus Libavii).         All the other metals ought
  therefore to be placed between       tin  and antimony on the one
 hand, and the infusible acidifiable metals on the other.       Those
  which add to the greatest affinity for oxygen, the property of
  forming with it alkaline combinations, occupy in some measure
  the middle part of this interval, and are connected on the one
  hand with tin and antimony, and on the other with tungsten,
  columbium, chrome, and molybdenum, by two series of metals,
  which present in the one and the other series all the degrees of
  affinity for oxygen, and the oxides of which also pass gradually
  through the various degrees of alkalinity and acidity which cha
  racterize that kind of compounds ; but the bodies of which the
  tvfo series are composed, present besides sufficient differences to
  enable us always easily to determine that to which they belong.
      Such is the order, by which I have been led, not by systematic
  views, which I disavow ; but after having made a great number
   of attempts, in order to see if we could not adopt another with
                                                                    out

 XCIII.     On (fie LaiOs observed in the Distribution of vegetable
           Forms.     By AlexamuiR Count Huaiboldt**
 Botany, long confined to the simple description of the external
 forms of plants and their artificial classification, now presents
 several branches of study, which place it more on a footing with
 the other sciences.      Sitch are the distribution of vegetables ac
 cording to a natural method founded 'upon the whole part of
 their structure; physiology, which displays their internal organi
 sation ; botanical geography, which assigns to each tribe of plants
 their height, limits, and climate.          The terms aipine plants;
 plants of   hot  countries,  plants of  the sea-shore, are to be found
 in all languages,   even  in those  of the most savage nations on the
 banks of the Oronoko.          They prove that the attention of men
 has been constantly fixed on the distribution of vegetables, and
 on their connexion with the temperature of the air, the elevation
 of the soil, and the nature of~ the ground which they inhabit.
 It does not require much sagacity to observe, that on the slope
 of the high mountains of Armenia, vegetables or a different lati
 tude follow each in succession, like the climates, superposed as it
 were upon each other.         This idea of Tournefort, developed by
 Linnaeus in two interesting dissertations, (Stationes et Colonics
 Plant arum,) nevertheless contains the first seeds of botanical
 geography.      Menzel, the author of -on unpublished Flora of Ja
 pan, strongly recommends to travellers researches as to the dis
tribution of species in the different regions of the globe.              He
 had even pointed out the result before by the name of the Geo
 graphy of Plants. This appellation was again employed, and
 almost at the same time, about the year 1783, by the Abbd
 Giraud Soulavie, and by the celebrated author of the Studies of
 Nature; a work which, amid a great variety of very inaccurate
 ideas as to the physique of the globe, contains some profound
 and ingenious views as to the forms, relations, and habitudes of
 vegetables.     Abbe Giraud Soulavie was occupied in preference
 with the plants already cultivated : he has distinguished the cli
 mates of the olive trees, the -vines, and the chesnuts.         He gives
 a vertical section of Mount Mezin, to which he has added the
   *

                                                      " he has a great
contempt for every result taken from barometrical measurement."
His Geography of the Plants in the South of France was followed
by the Tenlamen Historice geographies /egt-.talilium of the
learned Professor Strohmayer, published in 1800 at Gottingen
in the form of a dissertation ; but thisTentamen exhibits rather
the plan of a future work, and the catalogue of authors to be
consulted, than information respecting the altitudes which spon
taneous plants reach in different climates.        The case is the same
with the very philosophical views announced by M. Treviranus
in his Essai de Biologie ; we therein find general considerations,
but no measurements of heights, and no thermometrical indica
tions, which are the solid bases of the geography of plants. This
study has nor. risen to the rank of a science, until men of science
have perfected both the measures of heights by barometrical
observations, and the determination of mean temperatures ; or,
what is more important for the development of vegetation, the
determination     of the differences between the temperature of
summer and winter and between that of day and night.                Few
branches of study have in our day made more rapid progress ; and
a long time has not intervened between the first efforts and the
present period, when by the united observations of a great num
ber of travellers, we have succeeded in fixing the limits of ve
getables in Lapland, the Pyrenees, the Alps, Caucasus, and the
 Cordilleras of America.
   The vegetables which cover the vast surface of the globe pre
sent, when we study by natural classes or families, striking dif
ferences in the distribution of their forms : it is to the laws of this
distribution that I have recently turned my attention.            On li
miting   them  to  the countries  in which   the number  of  the species
is exactly known*, and by dividing this number by that of the
 Glumacecef, the leguminous plants, the labiated, and the com
pound, we find numerical relations which form very regular
series.    We see certain forms become more common from the
equator   towards   the pole, like the ferns, the glumacege, the eri-
cineas, and the   rhododendrons.     Other forms on the contrary in
crease from the poles towards the equator, and may be consi
dered in our hemisphere as southern forms: such are the ru-
biaceee, the malvaceae, the euphorbia, the leguminous and the
composite plants.       Finally, others attain their maximum even
La  the temperate zone, and diminish also towards the equator
   * Lapland, France, England, &c. according to Me3srs, Wahlenberg,
Bach, Ramond, Decandolle, and Smith.
   t The Glumace* contain the three families of Grammes, Cyperacea, and
                                                                     and

448           On the Laws observed in ike Distribution
and the poles.       Such are the labiated plants, the amentaces*
the cruciferae, and the umbeMiferae.      Part of these data long since
struck botanical travellers, and all those who have looked into
herbals.    It was known that the cruciferae and umbellifeiae dis
appeared almost entirely in the plains of the torrid zone, and
that none of the malvaceae were found beyond the polar circle.
It is the same with the geography of the plants as with meteoro
logy. The results of those sciences are so simple that in all ages
general ideas have been formed of them: but it is only after la
borious researches, and after having collected a great number of
accurate observations, that numerical results were attained, and
an acquaintance with the partial modifications undergone by the
law of the distribution offorms. A table which we have drawn
up exhibits this law with respect to sixteen families of plants
distributed over the equatorial, temperate, and glacial zones. We
there see with satisfaction mixed with surprise, how in organic
nature, the forms present constant relations under the same iso
thermal parallels, i. e. on curves traced by points of the globe
-which receive an equal quantity of heat.          The grasses form in

crease a little in the northern part       of  the new continent ; for,
according to the new Flora of Pursch, there is between the pa
rallels of Georgia and Boston 1 -6th ; whereas in Germany we
find l-8th; and in France l-7th,of the total number of the species
with visible fructification.    In the whole temperate zone, the
glutnaceae  and  the  composite plants form together, nearly one-
fourth of the phanerogamous plants ; the glumaceae, the com
posites, the cruciferae and the leguminosae, together nearly one-
third. It results from these researches that the forms of or
ganized beings are in a mutual dependence, and that the unity
of nature is such that the forms are limited, the one after the
other, according to constant laws easy of determination.         When
we know upon any point of the globe the number of species pre
sented by one of the great families of the glumaceae, the com
posite, the cruciferous, or the leguminous plants, we may estimate
with considerable probability both the total number of the pha
nerogamous plants, and the number of species which compose
the other vegetable families.      It is thus that, by knowing under
the temperate zone the number of the cyperaceae or composite
plants, we may guess at that of the gramineous or leguminous
plants.

     The number of vegetable species described by botanists, or ex
 isting in European herbals, extends to 44000, of which 6000
  are agamous.       In this number we had already included 3000
 new phanerogamous species enumerated by M. Bonpland and
  myself.    Fiance, according to M. Decandolie, possesses 3645
 phanerogamous plants, of which 460 are glumaceae, 490 com
 posite, and 230 leguminous, &c.               In Lapland there are only
 497 phanerogamous plants; among which are 1^4 glumacese,
 5S composite, 14 leguminous, 23 amentaceous, &c. See my
  Essay on the Geography of Plants published in 1806, and of
 which I am preparing a new edition.
     In order to account for the differences which exist sometimes
 between the relations exhibited by Germany, North America,
 and France, we must take into consideration the more or less
 temperate climates of those regions.            Fiance extends from 42£°
 to 5 1° of latitude. On this extent the mean annual heat is 16° T
 to 11": the mean heats of the summer months are 24° to 19°.
 Germany,       comprised between 46° and 54° of latitude, pre
 sents at its extremities mean annual temperatures of 12" 5' and
 S° 5'. The mean heats of the summer months there are 21°
 and 18°.       North America, in its immense extent, presents the
 Ifiost varied climates.       Mr. Putsch has made us acquainted with-
 2000 phanerogamous plants which grow between the parallels
 of 35" and 44°; consequently under mean annual temperatures
 of 16° and 7°. The Flora of North America is a mixture of
  several Floras.     The southern regions give it an abundance of
malvaeeajand composite plants; the northern regions, colder than
 Europe under the same parallel, furnish to this Flora abundance
of rhododendrons, amentaceas, and coniferae. The caryophylleae,
 the umbeliiferae, and the crucifera are in general more rare in
 North America than in the temperate zone of the old conti
 nent*.
     These constant relations observed on the surface of the globe,
 in the plains from the equator to the pole,            are again traced in
 the midst of perpetual snows on the summits of mountains.                We
 may admit, in general, that on the Cordilleras of the torrid zone
the boreal forms become more frequent.                It is thus that we see
prevail at Quito on the summit of the Andes, the ericineae, the

450             Laws observed in the Distribution
rhododendrons, and the gramineous plants.         On the contraYy>
the labiatae, the rubiacese, the malvaceae, and the euphorbiaceai
then become as rare as they are in Lapland.        But this analogy
is not supported in the ferns and the composite plants. The
latter abound on the Andes, whereas the former gradually dis
appear when they rise above 1800 fathoms in height. Thus the
climate of the Andes resembles that of northern Europe only
with respect to the mean temperature of the year.        The repar
tition of heat into the different seasons is entirely different, and
powerfully influences the phaenomena- of vegetation.      In general,
the forms which prevail among      the Alpine plants are, according
to my researches, under the torrid zone, the graminecs
 (segopogon, podossemum, deyeuxia, avena) ; the composites
(culcitium, espefetia, aster, baccharis) ; and; the caryophyllece
 (arenaria, stellaria).  Under the temperate zone, the com
posite (senecio, leontodon, aster) ; the caryophyllece (ceras-
tium, cherleria, silene) ; and the critciferce (draba, lepidium).
Under the frozen zone, the caryophyllece (stellaria, alsine) ;
the ericinece (andronveda) and the ranuneulaceee.
    These researches into the law of the distribution of forms, na
turallv lead to the question whether there exist plants common
to both continents ? a question which inspires the more interest,
as it belongs to one of the most important problems in Zoonomia.
It has been long known, and it is one of the most interesting
results from the geography of animals, that no quadruped, no
terrestrial bird, and, as appears from the researches of M. La-
treille, almost no insect, is common to the equatorial regions of
the two worlds.      M. Cuvier is convinced by precise inquiries
that this rule applies even to reptiles.    He has ascertained that
the true boa constrictor is peculiar to America, and that the
boas of the old continent were pytons. As to the regions beyond
the tropics, Buffon has multiplied beyond measure the number
of the animals common to America, to Europe, and the north of
Asia. We are assured that the bison, the stag, and the goat of
America, the rabbit and the musk rat, the bear, &e. &c. are
species entirely different from those of Europe, although Buffon
had affirmed the contrary.      There remain only the glutton, the
wolf, the white bear, the red fox, perhaps also the elau, which
 have not characters sufficient to entitle them to be specific.
 Among the plants, we must distinguish hetweeu the agamae and
 the cotyledone* ; and by considering the latter between the mo-
 nocotylodens and the dicotyledons.       There remains no doubt
 that many of the mosses and lichens are to be fmmd at ouee in
 equinoctial America and in Europe : our herbals show this. But
 the case is not the same with the vascular agamae as with the
  agamee of a cellular texture.   The ferns and- the lycopodiaceae

do not follow the same laws with the mosses and the lichens,
The former, in particular, exhibit very few species universally to
be found ; and the examples cited are frequently doubtful.        A»
to the phanerogamous plants (with the exception of the rhizo-
phora, the avicennia, and some other littoral plants), the law of
 Buffon seems to he exact with respect to the species furnished
with two cotyledons. It is absolutely false, although it has been
often affirmed, that the ridges of the cordilleras of Peru, the
 climate .of which has some analogy with the climate of France
 or Sweden, produce similar plants.       The oaks, the pines, the
yews, the ranunculi, the rose-trees, the alchemilla, the valerians,
 the stellaria, the draba of the Peruvian and Mexican Andes, have
nearly the same physiognomy with the species of the same ge
nera of North America, Siberia, or Europe.        But all these al-
pine plants of the Cordilleras, without excepting one among
three or four thousand which we have examined, differ specifi
cally from the analogous species of the temperate zone of the old
continent.     In general, in that part of America situated between
 the tropics, the monocotyledontal plants alone, and among the
latter almost solely the cyperaceoe and the graminese, are com
 mon to the two worlds.       These two families form an exception
 to the general law which we are here examining, — a law which is
so important for the history of the catastrophes of our planet,
and according to> which the organized beings of the equinoctial
regions differ essentially in the two continents.    I have given in
My Prolegomena a precise catalogue of those monocotyledontal
plants common to the shores of the Oronoko, Germany, and the
East Indies.      Their number does not exceed 20 or 24 species,
among which it is sufficient to cite the cyperus mucronatus,
    hydra, hypaelyptum argenteum, poa eragrostis, andropogon,
allioni, &c.
    In North America placed beyond the tropics, we find nearly
one-seventh of monocotyledontal and dicotyledontal plants com
mon to the two continents.        Of 2900 phanerogamous species
collected in the New Flora of Pursch, 390 are European. It is
true that we may hazard some doubts, as well with respect to
the number of the plants which have accompanied Europeans
from one hemisphere to the other, as upon those which, when
better examined, will be recognised subsequently as new species :
but it is impossible that this state of uncertainty should extend
to all ; and it is to be presumed that, even after a careful exami
nation, the number of the species common to the temperate
Zones of the two worlds will still remain very considerably ana
logous.     Mr. Brown recently undertook some researches on the
plants of New Holland. A twenty-eighth part of all the mono
cotyledons hitherto found in the austral continent are common

452      Laws observed in the Distribution of vegetable Forms.
to it with England, France, and Germany.      Among the dicoty
ledons the ratio is only 1 in 200; which proves once more how,
in the two hemispheres, the grasses and the cyperacese are the
most diffused, on account of the extreme flexibility of their or
ganization. It would be desirous that learned zoologists should
endeavour to examine the analogous numerical ratios presented
by the distribution of the different families of animals on the
globe.
    In the austral hemisphere the vegetable forms of the torrid
Zone advance more towards the pole than in the boreal hemi
sphere.    The fern-trees in Asia and America are rarely to be
found beyond the tropic of Cancer ; whereas in the austral part
of our globe the Dicksonia antarctica, the trunk of which is six
metres in height, pushes its migrations as far as Van Diemen's
Land under the latitude of 42° : it has even been found in New
Zealand, in Dusky Gulph, under the parallel of Lyons.
    Other forms not less majestic, and which were thought to be
long exclusively to the equinoctial Flora, the parasite orchidete
{epidendra, dendrobia) are found mixed with the arborescent
ferns far beyond the tropic of Capricorn, in the centre of the
austral temperate zone.      These phenomena of the geography of
plants prove how vague is what has been generally said of the
great diminution of temperature in the southern hemisphere^
without distinguishing between the parallels more or less near
the pole, and without any regard to the division of heat among
the different seasons of the year. Those regions towards which
the equinoctial forms extend, possess, on account of the immen
sity of the seas which surround them, a true island climate.
From the tropic of Capricorn to the parallel of 34°, and per
haps still further, the mean heats of the year    (i.  e. the quantity
of heat received    by any given point   of  the  globe) do not differ
considerably in the two hemispheres.        On casting our eyes over
 the three continents, New Holland, Africa, and America, we find
that the mean annual temperature of Port Jackson (lat. 33° 51')
is   9° 3' of the centigrade thermometer
     1                                      :    that of the Cape of
Good Hope (lat. 33° 55') 19° 4'; that of the town of Buenos
 Ayres (lat. 34e 36') 19° 7'.    We may be surprised at this great
 equality in the distribution of heat by  the 34° of austral latitude.
 Meteorological observations, stiil more precise, prove that    in the
 boreal hemisphere, under this very parallel of 34°, we find a   mean
 temperature of 19° 8'. On advancing towards the sntaieic pole,
 perhaps even to the parallel of 57°, the temperatures of the two
 hemispheres differ less in winter than summer.         The Malouine.
 Islands, situated in 51° anda   half of south latitude, have less in
 tense cold  in winter than is experienced at London.       The mean
 temperature of Van Diemen's Land seems to be 10'}         it   freeze*

during winter, but not so much as to destroy the fern-trees and,
the parasite orchideaj.      In the adjoining seas Capt. Cook, in
42° of austral latitude,   did  not see the thermometer fall below
 + 6°, 6 in the midst of winter (July). To these very mild win
ters, summers succeed remarkable for an extraordinary coolness.
At the southern extremity of New Holland (lat. 42° 41') the
temperature of the air rarely rises in the midst of summer at
noon-day1 higher than 12° or 14°; and in Patagonia, as in the
adjoining ocean (lat. 48'— 58J), the mean heat of the wannest
month is only 7°— 83; whereas in the boreal hemisphere at Pe
tersburg and Umeo (lat. 593 56' and 63° 50") this heat exceeds
 17 — 19.     It is this mild temperature of the islands, which
the southern countries enjoy between 30° and 40? of latitude,
which permits the vegetable forms to pass beyond the tropic of
 Capricorn. They embellish a great part of the temperate zone ;
and the genera which the inhabitant of the northern hemisphere
regards as exclusively belonging to the tropu al climates, present
numerous species between the parallels of 353 and 38" of south
latitude.

 Essays on Insanity, Hypochondriasis, and other Nervous Af
   fections. By John Reid, M.D. Member of Ike Royal Col
    lege of Physicians, London; and lute Physician to the lins-
    lury Dispensary . pp. 272. 8vo. Longman and Co.
 Our     readers will find in the above work a rational and philoso
 phical view of the most distressing of all the afflictions to which
 human nature is subject.       The treatment recommended by Dr.
 Reid is that of gentleness and kindr.ess on all occasions, and co
 incides in all its bearings with the views which have been taken
 of this distressing subject, by those enlightened legislators and
 other friends of humanity who have of late directed the public
 attention to the condition of those afflicted with mental derange
ment.
    Dr. Reid's ideas of modern lunatic asylums    are precisely those
 which now generally prevail, and by the adoption of which much
 human misery will in all probability be in future spared ; and to
 his. credit be it remembered, that the hints which we are about
 to subjoin were thrown out in another form several years ago by
 the enlightened author, and so far he may claim the merit of
 originality.   We now present pur readers with the doctor's de
 scription of those charnel houses of the human intellect called
 Lunatic Asylums, as a specimen not only* of his philosophical

and expanded views, but as a pleasing example how forcibly such
a heart-rending subject can be made to press on the human mind,
and even how attractive it can be rendered, by those charms of
eloquence, accompanied by a poetical yet chaste imagination,
for which all Dr. Reid's writings are distinguished.

   "The    mind of a man maybe bruised or broken as well as any
limb of his body, and the injury, when it occurs, is not so easy
of reparation.   A morbidly tumid fancy cannot, like many other
swellings, be made speedily to subside ; an intellect out of joint
will not allow of being set with the same facility as a dislocated
bone ; nor can the deep and often hidden ulcerations which arise
from mental distemper or disorganization,      be healed with the
same readiness or certainty as those more palpable sores which
take place on the surface of the body.    On this account it is,
that so close and vigilant an observation is required in watching
the incessantly varying movements, and in inspecting the too
exquisitely delicate texture of a disordered and highly wrought
imagination.
  " One thing at least       is certain, that in the management of
 such maladies, tenderness is better than torture, kindness more
 effectual than constraint.       Blows, and the strait-waistcoat,
 are often, it is to be feared, too hastily employed.    It takes less
trouble to fetter by means of cords, than by the assiduities of
sympathy or affection.         Nothing has a more favourable and
 controuling influence over one who is disposed to or actually af
fected with melancholy or mania, than an exhibition of friend
 ship or philanthropy; excepting indeed in such cases, and in
that state of the disease, in which the mind has been hardened
 and almost brutalized, by having already beeu the subject of
 coarse and humiliating treatment.        Where a constitutional in
clination towards insanity exists, there is in general to be ob
served a more than ordinary susceptibility to resentment at any
 act that offers itself in the shape of an injury or an insult.
  "   Hence it will not appear surprising, that as soon as an unfor
tunate victim has beeu inclosed within the awful barriers of either
the public or the minor and more clandestine Bethlems, the destiny
of his reason should, in a large proportion of cases, be irretrie
vably fixed.     The idea that he is supposed to be insane, is al
most of itself sufficient to make him so 5 and when such a mode

it too generally   is, applied even to brutes, can we wonder

semblance or merely an incipient approximation ?
   " Tasso, the celebrated poet, was once instigated by the vio
lence of an amorous impulse to embrace a beautiful woman in
the presence of her brother, who happening to be a man of rank
and power, punished this poetic license by locking up the offen
der in a receptacle for lunatics.  It is said that by this confine
ment he was made mad, who was before only too impetuous or
indiscreet.

injustice is committed, and how much useless and wantonly in
flicted misery is endured, in those infirmaries for disordered, or
rather cemeteries for deceased intellect.          Instead of trampling
upon    we  ought  to cherish,  and  by the  most   delicate and anxious
care strive to nurse into a clearer and a brighter flame the still
glimmering embers of a nearly extinguished mind.

the value of institutions which, under a judicious and merciful
superintendance, might be made essentially conducive to the pro
tection of lunatics themselves, as well as to that of others, who
would else be continually exposed to their violence and caprice.
But it is to be feared that many have been condemned to a state
of insulation from all rational and sympathizing intercourse be
fore the necessity has occurred for so severe a lot.            Diseased
members have been amputated from the trunk of society before
they have become so incurable or unsound as absolutely to re
quire separation.      Many of the depots for the captivity of intel
lectual invalids may be regarded only as nurseries for and manu
factories of madness ; magazines or reservoirs of lunacy, from
which is issued, from time to time, a sufficient supply for perpe
tuating and extending this formidable disease, — a disease which
is not to be remedied by stripes or strait-waistcoats,         by impri
sonment or impoverishment,          but by an unwearied tenderness,
and by an unceasing and anxious superintendance.

     June 13. —  T.   A. Knight, Esq. F.R.S. in a letter to the
 President, communicated the results of some further experiments
 which he has made on the leaves of plants, tending to prove that
 the matter of timber is formed in them, and that the true sap,
 descending from the leaves to the roots, forms alburnum.             He
                                                                    made

                            Royal Society.                        457
made a transverse and longitudinal section of the leaf stalk of a
vine, and raising up the bark an inch below the leaf, inserted it
in the section of the leaf stalk ; and thus preserving a communi
cation between the bark and leaf, the intermediate part being-
rolled tight with paper, he found that the bark acquired thick
ness, and a woody character. He next took the leaf of a potatoe
and planted it ; but although it did not, as he expected, produce
tuberous roots, it formed, like cuttings of shrubs previous to their
Striking root, a large round lump, which lived through the win
ter, and he is now trying whether it will grow into a perfect
potatoe.     He took a shoot of a vine detached from the' stock,
and immersing a part of its largest leaf in water during a month,
the smaller leaf not only lived but grew, and acquired thickness:
this he considers a clear proof that the smaller leaf was nourished
and augmented only by the food it received from the large one,
which was partly in water.        In addition to these experiments
 Mr. Knight observes, that if trees be deprived of their leaves their
 fruit never ripens ; that evergreens bear fruit at all seasons of the
year, in winter as well as summer ; and that deciduous plants
 only produce their fruit previous to shedding their leaves. The
 common holly is seen with its berries in the midst of winter.
The quality and quantity of fruit, he seems to think, almost en
 tirely depend on the nature and quality of the leaves ; and hence
 the necessity of gardeners being more cautious in stripping off
 the leaves of fruit trees where they tend to keep the sun off the
 fruit.
     Dr. Holland, F.R.S. communicated an account of a manufac
 tory of sulphat of magnesia in Monte della Guardia, about five
 miles from Genoa. This mountain, which is at the extremity of
 the Appenines, is about 2000 feet above the level of the sea,
 and abounds in veins of copper and iron pyrites, and magnesias
 limestone.     The original manufactory was confmed to sulphat
 of iron and copper ; but it was discovered that magnesia was
 very abundant, and that it also could be procured by the same
 process.   The process is very simple ; the ore is roasted eight or
 ten days with a wood fire, it is then dissolved in water, and the
 sulphats of iron and copper crystallized ; about one per cent. of
 the magnesian lime is added, and sulphat of magnesia is formed,
 which is sold in Italy under the denomination of sal inglesa.
 The peculiarity in this process is the quantity of magnesian lime
 added : if it were greater, sulphat of lime would be produced ; if
 less, no sulphat of magnesia would be formed. This manufactory
 is but small, and is situated on the side of the hill, about 16Q0
 feet above the level of the sea. The ore is dug out of the moun
  tain in a manner to form a kind of tunnel; but the magnesian
 limestone is very abundant.

       June 20.— Dr. Brewster, in a letter to the President gave an
   account     of his experiments on the eyes of fishes, by which it
   appears that the crystalline lens of fishes, according to its den
  sity, is capable of receiving the property of double refracting cry
   stals, the same as glass, by compression.          Dr. B. related a num
   ber  of  experiments     which   he  made  on the eyes of fishes, and their
   effects on colours ; from which he concludes that one part of a
  fish's eye experiences mechanical dilatation, and another mecha
  nical contraction.         He thinks that the chief cause why so little
   progress    has  been   made   in augmenting our knowledge of the eve
  and of vision,      is owing   to  an excessive confidence in a supposed
  analogy between optic glasses and the crystalline lens.
       Sir Everard Home, Bart. furnished a supplement to a former
  paper on the skeleton of a peculiar kind of fish in Mr. Bullock's
  Museum.         Two gentlemen having procured parts of this singu
  lar   animal   in  different places of the country, were so kind as to
  submit them       to  Sir E.'s inspection ; in consequence of which he
  can now state       with  confidence, what he before only conjectured,
  that the animal must have been a fish, as the bones which are
 wanting to complete Mr. Bullock's specimen have been partly
  discovered in Dorsetshire, and part elsewhere.                He has now
 made drawings of the perfect skeleton, to illustrate this and his
 preceding paper on the subject. He noticed particularly the cha
 racteristic differences between the ribs of land and sea animals ;
 the former being joined to the vertebrae, in order to rise and fall
 in breathing; the latter being fixed, and adapted to support the
 sides against the lateral pressure of, and suit the fish's motion
through, the water.

 Analysis     of   the Labours of the Class        of Mathematical and

                                   CHEMISTRY.
    The third volume of the Elementary Chemistry of M. Thenard
has appeared.          This learned professor therein treats at full
length, and according to the most modern discoveries, (among
which there are a great many for which science is indebted to
him,) of the immediate principles of organized bodies, of the
various productions, of their decomposition, and of their employ
ment in the arts.        The fourth volume, which will conclude the
work,   is  in  the  press.
                       MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY.
   Among the questions which the learned who are occupied
with the theory of the earth generally agitate, there are few
more difficult, or which have occasioned longer and more ob
stinate disputes, than that of the origin of basalts, a kind of rock
which some consider as the production of ancient volcanoes,
while others regard them as deposited in the general liquid in
which the common rocks are formed, and as analogous to the
trapps of the primitive earths.
    M. Cordier, inspector of mines, and correspondent of the
Class, having also directed his attention to this grand problem,
has imagined, in order to resolve it, means entirely new.
    His first reflections made him perceive that the greatest dif
ficulty, in order to compare the matter of a contested nature
                                                                       with

460                    Royal Institute of France.
with those of which the origin, either volcanic or non-volcanic,
is incontestable,    is to be ascribed to the circumstance of both
lieing often- composed of particles so mixed, and reduced into a
paste of an appearance so homogeneous, that it is impossible to
discern them with the eye.          Chemistry cannot here come to
 the  assistance of the  senses, because  it confounds all those par
 ticles in its analysis, and only gives as a result the sum total of
 their primitive elements, in place of distinguishing those which
 belong to each of their species.
     M. Cordier, therefore, contrived a new mode of mechanical
 analysis, which consists in reducing in the first place into small
 bits, the mineral specimens the existence of which we may sus
 pect in rocks which we wish to examine ; 2dly, determining
 clearly the physical characters of those parcels, and their man
 ner of acting when exposed to the blowpipe; 3dly, pulverizing
 the rocks submitted to examination ; and lastly, in washing and
 sifting the various particles detached by this pulverization, and
 submitting them to the same tests to which parcels of substances
 well known are subjected.
     Thisis,  as may be seen,   a kind of microscopical mineralogy,
 from which M. Cordier has derived great advantage.                 The
 pastes,   known   by  the name  of  lavas,  and  historically stated as
such, were easily detected      bythis new analysis their particles
                                                       :
were easily separated   :  they exhibited but a small number of
combinations, in which sometimes feldspar prevailed, sometimes
pyroxene, and in which they were alloyed in various proportions
with the ore of iron denominated titanium — with those three
elements are mixed, but in          manner less general, amphibole,
                                    a
amphigene, mica, peridot,     and  oligistous iron.
    The basaltic pastes of an origin more or less contested were
as easily divided into their constituent parts, and those parts
were not found different.     All those ancient or modern pastes,
whether recognised as lava or not, are therefore, according to
the author, microscopical granites,     in which the uniformity of the
intermixed texture    is interrupted only         by
                                                 very small vacancies
a  little less rare in some lavas than        others, and which ap
                                             in
peared to the naked eye to be homogeneous masses, in which
are prevalent either the characters of the pyroxene or those of
feldspar, and which cannot then be distinguished but            bytwo
sorts.
    A part of the scoriae which accompany the stony lavas, and
which   are the first products of the coagulation of matters in
fusion, are also composed of various grains, but finer, less re
gularly interwoven, and nevertheless of the same species with the
masses which they cover     ;another part more changed        theby
action of fire approaches uiore the vitrified state       others,

finally, are completely in this state : but there always remain so
many traces of their origin that we cannot mistake them. They
are always referred to one of the two principal orders of combi
nations recognised among the stony lavas.
    M. Cordier endeavours to explain, by the difference in the
state of the scoria;, the phenomenon which has astonished so
many travellers ; namely, that certain currents of lava remain
constantly sterile, while others are soon covered with the most
luxuriant vegetation.      It arises from the circumstance of the
former being more vitrified than the latter, and therefore being
less easily decomposed.
    The author also examines the obsidians, or volcanic glass ;
and by comparing together all the shades of their greater or
lesser vitrification, he always finds some traces of that pyroxene
or feldspar, the predominant piinciples of the two orders of lava;
 and the obsidians which melt into black glass have shown per
 fect transitions even the length of the thickest basalt ; in a
 word, the obsidians, the scoriae, the lava, the basalts do not
 differ in composition, but only by the accidents in their texture.
 Even the volcanic sands and ashes yield upon being washed the
 same materials the aggregation of which forms the adjacent
 lavas.     M. Cordier has pursued those materials into various
 substances, and after they had been altered by time, and extri
 cated them from the new substances which enveloped them, or
 which had been as if filtered into the interstices.   In a word, he
 has not neglected the examination of any of the modifications
 of the true or contested volcanic productions, and has no
 where found his general rules defective: but when he passed af
 terwards to those trapps, and petro-silex, in short, to those an
 cient rocks to which basalts are sometimes referred, he has no
 longer recognised any of those characters so marked, which are
 said to establish between the lavas and the basalts incontestable
 relations.
     The mass of those ancient rocks has no apparent vacuities,
  and they do not differ from each other in point of colour.    This
  cannot be insulated, nor can a mechanical analysis be made of
  them : consequently, if a part of those rocks are composed of
  heterogeneous materials, it is not possible to determine the mi-
  neralogical species to which those materials belong.              ; .
     Their chemical analysis also gives other results, particularly
  because it yields no titanium.
     Thus the pretended analogy between the trapps and the ba
  salts will not support a rigorous examination.
     As to the origin of the lavas and the causes of their fusion,
  M. Cordier risks no conjecture; but, considering their mass as
  coagulated by an instantaneous crystallization,' he easily resolves
                                                                  the

    the peculiar problem long debated upon ; If the crystals irt the
    lavas have been taken up completely formed from the bowels of
    the earth, and enveloped by them, or if they are formed after
    wards in their vacant spaces or cells; or, finally, if they have
    crystallized at the same moment when the rest of their mass
   was hardened: and he gives us to understand that it is the latter
   opinion which he adopts.
        He terminates his curious investigation bv a methodical enu
   meration of basalts and other products of volcanoes arranged
   according to their materials of aggregation, and under the ban
   ners of the two substances which therein predominate, feldspar
   and pyroxene.
       This mysterious natufe of volcanoes, these immense foci of heat,
   far removed from all the conditions which keep up heat at the
   surface of the earth, will be still a long time one of the great
   objects of the curiosity of natural philosophers, and will excite
   their efforts so long as any hopes of success remain.          A young
   mineralogist as zealous as he is learned, M. Mesnard de la
   Grove, having had occasion in 1812 and 1813 to observe «e-
  veral of the phaenomena of Vesuvius, drew up a journal of them
  with great accuracy, intermixed with many original suppositions
  and ideas.
       Since the enormous diminution which the cone of the volcano
  underwent in 1794, when it sunk more than 400 feet, all the
  eruptions have taken place from its summit; which seems to have
 prevented them from being so abundant and so destructive as
  those which issued from its sides.           The bottom of the crater
 rose, and it is     not  unlikely that it will be filled.
       The rivers of lava are the less' abundant if a great quantity of
 scoriae and small stones are thrown out during the eruption.
 The whole cone is covered with those small stones, which are
 soon changed by the acid vapours, and assume those lively and
 variegated colours which make them look like bunches of flowers
 at a distance, and which have inclined naturalists to suppose
 that the crater is filled with sulphur; which is so far from being
 true, that it is even very rare that sulphurous vapours are per
 ceived in it : on the contrary, there rise strong and continual ex
 halations of muriatic acid, and sea salt is every where concreted
 throughout.
      M. Mesnard     de  la Groye thence takes occasion to divide vol
 canoes into two classes ; those in which sulphur performs an
essential part, and those in which the muriatic acid prevails. It
is among the latter, that he classes Vesuvius.
      He also notices the continual        smoke which rises from the
rivers     of lava, and which announce great humidity.        This smoke
is   in fact purely' aqueous.       No flames are seen,    but sands and

the lava owes its fluidity to some principle which                    consumed

mass, the part not swelled up into scoriae, has a stony aspect                           :
this is  what the Germans call grauslein.                The author compares
the periods of the fusion of the lavas with those through which
the salts pass, which fuse after being swelled up.                   He relates
some curious facts with respect to the prodigiously long duration
of their heat, and thence concludes that they bear within them
selves the principle of their own heat, and that they do not
possess a heat simply communicated.                     To all these remarks
M. de la Groye adds very detailed account of the grand erup
                                  a
tion of IS 13, which produced an infinity of ashes and small
stones, but the lava of which did not reach the length of the
 cultivated grounds.
    After having studied with so much care the burning volcanoes,
 M. de    laGroye wished also to give an account of the motives
upon which the opinion                 founded, that various mountains
                                           is
may be classed among burnt-out volcanoes                   and he visited one

Neptunists will still find abundance of pretexts for confirming
 their doubts.
    This mountain was that of Beaulieu, about three leagues from
Aix in Provence.         The inequalities of the soil which surrounds
it, represent currents similar to those of lava: its extent                              is

form the nucleus of the whole system, but in the basaltic part
itself there are also sea-shells and abundance of limestone. The
 amygdaloids and the basalts are covered with them in several
places ;   in others their fragments are incrusted with them, and
 compose with this limestone            sort of breche.

 current, and we pass from this rock by intermediate ones, com
 parable to trapps properly so called, to the common basalt, con
 taining frequently peridot, and some parts of which De Saussure
 saw divided into prisms.        There is also some vacqne or wack
 which    serves  as the basis of the amygdaloid,    and which when
 its cellules are empty completely resembles a porous lava; but
 in which they are most frequently filled with limestone, as in
 the mandelstein of the Germans.        Lastly, we find a basaltic tufa
 filled with small calcareous buttons, and containing pyroxenes,
 peridots, micas, and those other mineral species so common in
 the lavas.      M. Mesnard saw at Beaulieu a hollow which ap
 peared to him like the remains of a crater.      He concludes there
 fore, after some general reasoning against the objections of the
 Neptunists, that this mountain was the production of a sub
 marine eruption, and that the sea in which it was made con
tinued for a long time afterwards to deposit limestone.             De
Saussure had already appeared to be favourable to this opinion.
M. Paujas St. Fond regarded it as incontestable, and M. Mes
nard thought he saw in it a method of conciliating all opinions
on the pretended secondary trapps, which have been so long a
 subject of dispute.
     Among those numerous fragments of unknown organization
which fill the strata of the earth, there are found impressions of
an animal of a singular form composed of a sort of corslet, and
 an abdomen formed of several segments, each of which is di
vided into three lobes.      Naturalists have given them the names
of entomolites and trilobites; but they have not sufficiently di
stinguished them from each other, and have not determined to
what order of stratification each species belonged.
     M. Brongniart, the manager of the manufactory of Sevres, ha?
presented a work on this subject, in which, after an exact com
parison of the specimens which he procured, as well as of the
descriptions and figures left by preceding authors, he shows
that there are at least seven species of these trilobites, that their
principal forms are sufficiently distinct to divide them into four
genera, which ought to be all ranged in the class of crustaces,
and in the order of those whose gills or lungs are exposed to view.
The most of those trilobites belong to the deepest, i. e. the most
ancient of the stratifications of the soils which contain animal
remains ; they must therefore have been among the first ani
mated beings ; and in fact, as we approach the surface, we find
Crustaceae more similar to those now contained in the sea; but
the trilobites have disappeared entirely.'
     M. Cordier has published a memoir on the coal-mines of
France, and on the progress which has been made in their
working for the last twenty-five years. He proves that in this

   which points out the extent of our coal districts, the principal
   pits, and the direction of their various workings.
       M. Vauquelin has again turned his attention to meteoric stones.
   It appears to him that a part of their silex is in combination with
  magnesia : there is also sulphur united to their iron, for it gives
   sulphuretted hydrogen gas on being dissolved in the acids.          As
   to chrome, it seems to be isolated, and it shows itself sometimes
   in molecules so large as to remove every idea of combination.

      M. Arago made a verbal Report on the Voyage to the South
   Seas, drawn up by M. Louis Freycinet.
      The work is divided into four books: the first bears the title
   of the Itinerary, and makes known the successive order of the
   operations  ; the second comprehends the nautical and geogra
  phical descriptions  ; the third is destined to the analysis of charts;
   and the fourth contains the general results of the observations,
  the measurements of inclination and declination of the magnetic
  needle, the remarks of various kinds made during the voyage,
  and the daily meteorological observations.         The whole of the
  voyage is illustrated by thirty-two very fine charts.        M. Frey
  cinet himself engraved them on copper, and by a process peculiar
  to himself.     The chapter in which he describes his method, as
  well as that which relates to the division of the scales, well
  merits the attention of engineers.
      M. Biot read a Memoir drawn up by M. Pouillet and himself
 jointly, On the experimental determination of the diffraction
  undergone by simple or compound light when it passes be
  tween two parallel glass-bottle stoppers.        The authors refer to
  measurements of fringes taken at different distances of the bottle
  stoppers on a piece of ground glass ; and by constructing them
 they deduce the mode of separation of the rays, and the definitive
  division which the diffraction impresses upon them. According
'to these measurements, the ribbons which have the least deviated
 have their origin in the points of the interval the nearest to every
 stopper, and the most deviated have their origin nearest the cen
 tral axis, both being deviated towards the stopper from which
 they were originally the most distant.
      For every given separation of the stoppers, the incidence re
 maining always perpendicular to their interval, the deviations of
 ths luminous particles of various natures are proportional to the
 length of their fits in the medium in which the light moves; and

when the medium changes, all the other circumstances remaining
the same, the absolute size of the deviations, and consequently
the intervals of the fringes, vary also in proportion to the fits.
 The nature of the bodies which limit the medium do not change
this law, whatever be the difference of their refrangent force.
Stoppers of crown-glass opposed to each other form fringes in
 oil of turpentine, as metal stoppers would do if put in their place.
Water at a heat of 37° of the centigrade thermometer forms
fringes in water at 11°*.
               Sittings  of Monday, March         11, 1816.
     In the name of     a committee,    M. Arago made a Report on
the parallel mirrors which had been presented by Messrs. Richer.
     These glasses, which are of very delicate workmanship, are
 employed, as is well known, in the construction of reflecting in
struments, in that of tinned artificial horizons, which advan
tageously supply the place of the horizon of the sea in observa
tions which are made at land, and in the formation of the guards
which serve to keep the liquids, by the help of which we also
 sometimes procure the reflected images of the stars free from
those agitations which the least breath of wind makes them un
dergo.      For a long period the English artists have been in the
habit of supplying the French sextant-makers with parallel mir
rors. Messrs. Richer have succeeded in freeing us from this
tribute. The glasses submitted to the examination of the Class
were not less than four inches in diameter ; rarely have they ap
peared to occasion angular deviations of three seconds : — a si
milar glass, which a well known artist had recently purchased in
London, under the same circumstances, afforded greater devia
tions. The plain mirrors of Messrs. Richer, like those which
come out of the workshops of that excellent optician M. Re-
bours, may therefore fairly be put on a level with all that has
been done by foreigners of the same kind.
    M. Ivart gave a verbal account of several works upon agricul
ture, presented to the class by Sir John Sinclair.
    In the name of a committee, M. Giraud read a Report on a
memoir of M. Dupin relative to the laying down of roads.
   * Messrs. Biot and Pouillet bad undertaken these experiments at the
end of the summer of 1815. On the 9tli of October of the same year they
announced to the Inssitnte that they had discovered laws, according to
which the phenomenon of diffraction was found to have the most intimate
connexion with that of the coloured rings, aud might be deduced from
them numerically.    They had added that these laws indicated also the spe
cies of modification extremely singular, according to which the light was
diffracted.  These indications" are merely referred to the diffraction be
tween two stoppers, the only ones which the authors had considered in
their experiments.

     This memoir   is an application   of descriptive geometry to some
very important questions.       We conceive that we may arrive at
one point from another by an infinity of different roads ; but these
roads are not all equally favourable ; the inclination, for instance,
ought not to exceed in any point the limits given by experience,
and after which the moving powers no longer act with advan
tage : the limit of slope varies according to the method of effect
ing the transport of articles, whether on the backs of men or by
wheeled carriages.     The mathematical theory of M. Dupin em
braces all the elements of this question considered in the most          *
general manner.
   M. Brochaut read a paper on Gypsum. Messrs. Ramond and
Brongniart are to examine it.
   Monday, March 18. — A letter was read from Sir C. Blagdon.
He announces that they are at this moment constructing in
Cornwall steam-engines destined to work under a pressure of
seven atmospheres.      The trials already made seem to indicate
that they will be productive of immense advantages.          In order
to determine under what circumstances steam-engines ought to
produce the maximum of effect, keeping in view the quantity of
coal used, it is necessary to know the relation which may exist
at different temperatures between the elastic force of the steam
and the quantity of caloric necessary for its production. Already
had some French manufacturers ascertained that the increase of
the elastic force is superior to that of the caloric employed ; for
they found an advantage in working their machines under pres
sures superior to that of the atmosphere ; but the form of their
boilers did not admit of their much exceeding this term. In En
gland they have gene much further, by means of an invention of
Mr. Woolf's, and which is combined in such a way as to employ
the steam at very high pressures.      It seems also that the steam-
engines of this able engineer contain another useful modification,
and which consists in the heated steam never being in immediate
contact with the piston of the large cylinder, as it is in the com
mon machines ; in the latter case, as is well known, the piston
soon loses its accurate adjustment, because the steam dissolves
the greasy substances which lubricate it.       In Mr. Woolf's ap
paratus the steam enters into a first cylinder, and there it presses
on the surface of a column of oil, which it forces to enter into an
interior cylinder, in which is the piston : it thus raises the piston
without touching    it,and lets itfall as soon as  it  condensed.
                                                        is          It
is clear that this mechanism may be also applied on both sides of
the piston, so as to produce   a double effect.

                     VENTILATION     OF COAL-MINES.
         have already alluded to Mr. Ryan's improvements on this
important subject,       and we are happy to state that they have
been rewarded by the Society of Arts, by a vote of one hundred
guineas, and the gold medal, the highest premium ever voted by
the Society.
     Our readers already know that the most dreadful accidents
which happen in coal-mines, and those of most frequent occur
rence, arise from explosions occasioned by the accumulation of
hydrogen gas, and the defective means hitherto adopted of car
 rying off that deleterious and highly inflammable substance.
     Mr. Ryan's method of ventilation obviates all these dangers,
 and carries off every particle of the hydrogen gas the instant it
is liberated from the coal.        His first operation is to insulate the
whole mine, or field, as it is technically called, by cutting round
it a course or passage. This is what he calls his gas course ;
 and it is always made of a size sufficient to carry off all the gas
which would otherwise accumulate in the mine.                  Within the
body    of the  mine  itself, holes are  cut  of  different diameters,   en
tering   into  this gas  course  from  the   higher parts or   roof  of  the
mine.      Between this gas course and the lower part of the up
cast shaft of the mine, a communication is made, and the gas
by its levity naturally ascends.       Heat, however, is occasionally
applied at the lower part of this shaft to accelerate the exit of
the gas. Our philosophical readers must be aware that no mine
whatever can produce the quantity of hydrogen which a gas
course on this principle is capable of discharging.             In fact, on
the old system of ventilating by the labyrinth process, the at
mospheric air remains at least twenty hours in a mine of com
mon dimensions, during which it traverses a space of forty miles,
and becomes- every second more and more impregnated with hy
drogen gas, and consequently increasing the danger throughout
its whole passage through the workings of the mine.                On Mr.
Ryan's system, the inflammable gas, as fast as it flows from the
workings, takes the nearest course to the upper gallery or reser
voir for gas, whence it finds its way by the shortest course to
the upcast shaft, through which it passes into the open air.
    Mr? Ryan has introduced his valuable discovery with the hap
piest results into some of the most destructive and fiery coal
mines of Staffordshire and Worcestershire, and has obtained cer
tificates of the most flattering description from numerous re-r
spectable and humane mine-owners.                In some mines in Wor
cestershire, for instance, where daily explosions take place, and
where none but the rnost desperate characters could be obtained

   as workmen,    all alarm has subsided.    Since the Introduction of
   his system* the price of labour has fallen, and hundreds of Valu-
. able lives have been saved to the community.
      We cannot, in short, pronounce a better eulogiutti on the
   author of this valuable discovery^ than by presenting our readers
  with the short but eloquent address of the royal and illustrious
   President of the Society of Arts, when delivering the premiums
  awarded by the Society to this meritorious individual : " Mr.
   Ryan," said the Duke of Sussex, " in rising to present you with
  the rewards so justly voted you by the Society, they wish it to
  be understood, that they do not intend these rewards as any re
  muneration for your valuable discovery: for such remuneration
  you are to look to yourself — I mean, to the feelings of your own
  mind. But to mark their sense of your merits, the Societ / have
  Voted you the highest premium ever given by.them ; and when
  I reflect on the personal risks and dangers you have run in bring
  ing this invention to its present state — an invention which has
  already saved more than are now here present, and which pro
  mises to render the most lasting services not only to this, but to
  every country that may adopt it, I feel an increased source of
  satisfaction in being the organ of the Society on the occasion."
      It may perhaps redound still further to Mr. Ryan's credit, to
  state, that no fewer than ten meetings of the Committee of the
   Society thoroughly investigated his plans and models previously
  to the final vote of the Society, so that every opportunity was af
  forded for that ample and free discussion of his merits which they
  received.                     .
                    DEATH OF MR. THOMAS HENRY,
      We are sorry to announce the death of the celebrated Mr,
   Henry, of Manchester. The distressing event is thus announced
  to the public in Wheeler's Manchester Chronicle of June 22 : — >
  " Died, on Tuesday the 1 8th instant, in the 82d year of his age,
  Mr. Thomas Henry, President of the Literary and Philosophical
   Society of Manchester, Fellow of the Royal Society of London,
  and member of several other learned societies both in this coun
  try and abroad.. As a practical and philoaophical chemist he
  had obtained a high and merited reputation.        His contributions
   to that science, besides a small volume of Essays, and his trans
   lations of the early writings of Lavoisier, which he first intro
   duced to the notice of the English reader, consist chiefly of Me
   moirs dispersed through the Transactions of the various socie
   ties to which he belonged, and relating both to those parts of
   chemistry that are purely scientific, and to those which have a
   connexion with the useful arts. On a subject intimately connected

   mordants or bafics in dyeing) * Mr. Henry   ' was the first,'

                                                         ' who thought
  and wrote philosophically.' In the introduction, too, of the new
  mode of bleaching, which has worked an entire revolution in
  that art, and occasioned an incomparably quicker circulation of
   capital, he was one of the earliest and most successful agents.
   In addition to the acquirements connected with his profession,
   he had cultivated to no inconsiderable degree a taste for the pro
   ductions of the Fine Arts ; he had obtained a knowledge of his
   torical events remarkable for its extent and accuracy ; and he
   had derived, from reading and reflection, opinions to which he
   was steadily attached, on those topics of political, moral, and
   religious inquiry, which are most important to the welfare of
   mankind. For several years past he had retired from the prac
   tice of medicine, in which he had been extensively engaged,
   with credit and success, for more than half a century; and
   from delicate health he had long ceased to take an active share
   in the practical cultivation of science.   But possessing, almost
   unimpaired,    his faculties of memory and judgement,       he con
   tinued to feel a lively interest in the advancement of literature
   and philosophy.      Retaining also in their full vigour those kind
   affections of the heart that gave birth to the most estimable
   moral qualities, and secured the faithful attachment of his friends,
,  he passed through a long and serene old age, experiencing little
   but its comforts and its honours, and habitually thankful for the
   blessings with which Providence had indulged him."
                    RUSSIAN VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.
        The ship Suwarrow, Captain Lazaroff, belonging to the Rus
    sian East India Company, arrived at Spithead on Tuesday,
    June 18, whence she sailed on the 10th of March 1814, on a
   voyage of discoveries in the North Pacific Ocean, but more with
    a view to form two military and commercial       establishments on
   the west coast of North America, namely, at the island of Ro-
    diak, in lat. 55° N. long. 160° W. which is the nearest part of the
    American continent to the Russian establishment at Kamschatka,
    and upon a neck of land called California.        From these they
    will be enabled to carry on their fur-trade with China with
    greater advantages ; and their homeward-bound          voyage, with
    the produce of China, will be likewise greatly facilitated. The
     Suwarrow has been so far as lat. 58' 50' N. long. 190° 5fy E.
    fche touched at Kamschatka.        On the 10th of October 1814
    she discovered an island in lat. 13° 10" S. long. 163° 29' W. It
    is about eight miles and a half long, and seven miles wide. Co
    coa-nut trees and sea-fowl were found upon it. The rocks around
     it appear formed of solid coral. It not being laid down in any
     chart, Captain Lazaroff named it after his ship, " Suwarrow
                                                                Island."

                 List of Patents for  new Inventions,         471
Island."    It  appears from the great Vancouver's track, upon his
published chart, that he must have passed this island in the night
time. The Suwarrow has a valuable cargo of furs, which she
took on board in Norfolk Sound, with many articles the pro
duce of the coast of Peru.      She lay two months at Lima. The
cargo is not estimated at less than one hundred thousand pounds;
and so. prosperous has been the whole of the voyage, that she
has not sustained the loss of even a rope or spar of any descrip
tion since she sailed from Spithead. She has about fourteen rare
animals on board — species of the Lama, Vigonia, and Alpaca.
They are intended as a present to the Emperor of Russia. She
has since sailed for St. Petersburgh.
