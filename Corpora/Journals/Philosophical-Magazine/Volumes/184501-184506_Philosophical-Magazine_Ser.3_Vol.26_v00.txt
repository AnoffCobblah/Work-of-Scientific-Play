  To the   Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
THE  interest which the phaenomena of glaciers has recently
  excited induces me to offer for insertion in your Journal,
a somewhat detailed discussion of the causes of glacial motion.
                 I
In doing this shall confine myself to the sliding theory,
with which we usually associate the name of De Saussure, and
to that which has recently been propounded by Prof. Forbes,
and which attributes the motion of glaciers to the viscosity of
glacial ice. I shall omit           all
                                  consideration                of
                                                     those theories
which refer the motion       question
                               in          the freezing
                                                    to    and conse
quent expansion       of
                       water contained within the mass             the            of
glacier, because believe there are
                I                          present  at  this countryin
few persons who have sufficient confidence                    in
                                                   those theories                      to
feel much interest    inthe discussion of them.
   Prof. Forbes's theory has been some time before the public
in  his excellent work         on
                             the Alpine regions, and          various        in
letters addressed     toProf. Jameson and others; and              the            in

                                        glaciers according         the            to
sliding theory.      Inmy present communication          propose
                                                                                       to to

other has also been frequently urged, for which, however, there
is no real foundation. It has been contended that if a glacier

     6               Mr. Hopkins                on the Motion                of Glaciers.
          I have statedabove that there was very appreciable motion
     on a smooth    unpolished  slab, when the inclination did not ex
     ceed 40', and that           I
                            have no reason to suppose that a similar
     result would not be obtained at still smaller angles. Perhaps
     one of the best tests of the correctness of this conclusion is
     afforded by the second of the laws of the observed motion, viz.
     that the velocity, at small inclinations, is nearly proportional
     to the inclination. If the law were accurately true, there would
     be appreciable motion for the smallest appreciable inclination.
        3. By means of this law we easily establish the relation be
     tween the intensity of any additional retarding force and the
     retardation produced by          Let f= the retarding force, v=

                     Mr. Hopkins               on the        Motion of Glaciers.                                 7
 suming the approximate truth of the second of the laws above
 stated, there will be motion for very small values of a, or when
g sin o. is extremely small; consequently 4 (u) will become
nearly = zero when u = 0.             Hence at the instant the motion
begins from rest, the tangential action of the plane on the mass,
or conversely that of the mass on the plane, is approximately
 =0; but in a very short time that action (estimated as a
moving force) becomes = weight of the mass resolved in the
direction of the plane.          I have entered into this explanation
 to point out the distinction between the action of the retarding
force in the motion we are considering, and that of friction in
the common and established acceptation of the term.
    5. Temperature of the Lower Surface of a Glacier.—The
essential condition under which gravity becomes effective in
putting the loaded ice in motion in the experiments above de

results, may         applicable
                         be           any proposed glacier, we must

    zero before we reach the earthy nucleus.              Assuming this
condition       hold, we are able
                    to                   determine the greatest thick

is less than zero, the problem will present no peculiarity ari
sing from the circumstance of the exterior crust being com
posed of ice; but however greatly the external temperature
may exceed zero, the superficial temperature of the crust can
not, from the nature of ice, rise higher than zero.    Hence,
while the external temperature is below zero, we shall have
the ordinary case of a solid body placed in a medium of which
the temperature varies according to a given law; but when the
external temperature rises above zero, the condition at the sur
face will be that the superficial temperature of the mass shall
be constantly at zero. Instead of this last condition, however,
we may suppose that, during the time it would hold, the ear
ternal temperature shall be zero; for it is manifest that the
two conditions will in the case we are contemplating be very
approximately the same. Hence, then, the case for investiga
tion will be that of a sphere of large dimensions cooling in a
medium           of which the temperature is V + C cos (2                                    ºr   t +

      The temperature —5° (cent.) appears, however, to be much
lower than that observed at different depths by M. Agassiz,
and which did not exceed half a degree. The difference may,
I conceive, be easily accounted for.  In our investigation the
surface of the glacier has been supposed to be exposed to the
winter temperature, whereas, as soon probably as the mean
temperature of the twenty-four hours descends to zero, the
surface is protected from the external cold by a coating of
snow, which increases as the temperature diminishes, and thus
it is probable that the temperature of the surface of the ice may
descend but little below zero during the whole winter.              we                                   If

may be applied to a slab rough-hewn for a pavement. I have
already explained (art. 4.) that this action is extremely small
when the velocity = 0, but increases rapidly with the velocity
till it becomes equal to the moving force of gravity along the
inclined plane; and thus it is that while the action of the bed
 cannot prevent motion altogether, it never allows the velocity
 to exceed a very small value.                             If,

16                  Messrs. Faraday and Lyell on
where the glacier is most dislocated, and not where it is most
compact, because it is in those places that                I
                                                conceive the sli
ding of one part past another to take place. That such is the
case in many places is as unquestionable as the continuity of
the motion observed by Prof. Forbes.        It must not be sup
posed, however, that I reject the notion of ice having a certain
degree of plasticity and flexibility*.   It would be absurd for
any one to do so who has witnessed how the glacier de
l'Echaud and the glacier du Tacul form, by their union, the
Mer de Glace,       .#
                     the glaciers of Finsteraar and Lauteraar
form that of the Lower Aar. But I believe that these proper
ties are only developed in glacial ice to any considerable ex
tent, by the enormous forces to which certain portions of a
glacier are subjected; and I contend that this plasticity is not
such that the nechanism of glacial motion can be correctly
represented by that of a semifluid or viscous substance.     But
I  must reserve the subject of the mechanism of glacial motion
for my next communication.

       SIR,
      AVING,   in our former letter, expressed our entire con
      currence in the verdict of the jury, which exonerated the
proprietors of the Haswell Colliery from any blame in con

   * The terms plastic, fierible, viscous, semifluid, &c., appear to have been
used by Prof. Forbes too indiscriminately, as if they were convertible terms,
which is very far from being the case.      The application of the two latter
terms to a hard mass, like glacial ice, capable of supporting itself when
bounded by a free vertical section of a height at least a hundred, and
perhaps many hundred feet, I cannot but regard as a departure from                  all
propriety  of established language.

                                   Explosions in Coal Mines.                       17
 now proceed to consider how the recurrence of similar cata
 strophes may be obviated in future.
    The Haswell Collieries, where the explosion occurred, are
 situated about seven miles east of Durham, in that part of the
 Durham coal field which is overlaid by the magnesian lime
 stone, and about two miles within the outer limit or escarp
 ment of that formation.        In sinking the main shaft, which is
 155 fathoms    deep,  they   passed   through, below the outset or
 artificial elevation, first,  18 feet of soil, gravel, &c., then 363
 feet of limestone, red shale, and sandstone of the magnesian
limestone formation, and afterwards through 540 feet of the
coal measures; the strata of both formations being so nearly
horizontal, that they may be considered as being here in par
allel or conformable position.        The accompanying section [as
annexed to the     original   report]  of the beds passed through in
excavating the shaft, will show that no less than ten seams of
coal were met with, varying in thickness from 1 inch to 3 feet
7 inches; and that at a depth of 925 feet from the surface, the
coal called the Hutton seam was gained, which is 5 feet 5
inches thick, comprising, first, the top coal of superior quality,
4 feet 1 inch thick; secondly, layers of impure coal, 16 inches
thick, the upper portion of which, called the brassy coal, is
much charged with pyrites; and the lowest part, of better
quality, is said to give out much more gas than the top coal.
The dip of the beds is about 1 foot in 24 to the S.E.”
    In the Great Pit, which lies to the S.W. of the Little Pit,
and is ventilated by the same shafts, a large dike of trap or
greenstone was encountered, which had turned the coal into
coke, with numerous veins of calcareous spar, for a distance
of about 40 yards from the point of contact. Notwithstanding
the intrusion of this igneous rock, the strata in general are re
markably undisturbed. In the Little Pit, which we examined
carefully, only two or three slips of a few inches, and one fault
of two or three feet, appeared. The roof near the entrance
shaft was of white sandstone, with occasional seams of mica,
but throughout the greater part of the workings, which are
about 250 acres in extent, the roof or ceiling is composed of
shale, very unbroken and secure, and having given rise to ex
                                                     in,

twelve feet, the division into coal measures and magnesian limestone, and
of  the latter into upper magnesian and lower red sandstone, with about
twenty feet      superficial gravel and clay, has been inferred from the de

                        Messrs. Faraday and Lyell on
teen years during which the pit has been opened. The chief
danger to be guarded against, arises from what are termed
“caldron bottoms,” which are the stools or lowest portions
of erect fossil trees, filled with sandstone or shale, and having
their bark converted into coal, which gives way when they are
undermined, and allows the heavy cast of the interior of the
trunk, several feet or yards in height, to descend suddenly.
The Hutton seam rests on a sandy clay, which has not been
found adapted for a fire clay.         The floor composed of it does
not often rise in creeps.
    It will be seen by the section, that several upper seams of
good coal, the united thickness of four of which is no less than
13 feet, have been left untouched, in order that the thicker
and more valuable seam called the Hutton, should first be
worked out. In adopting this plan, the proprietors have been
guided by considerations of present profit, which the compe
tition of other neighbouring coal works renders indispensable.
Nevertheless, it may not be improper                      advert  fortwous   to               to
evils which result from this system.
    First. The upper seams which are undermined                  the ex                 on
traction    of   an
                  inferior bed       coal, sink down, often unequally,
                                           of
from failure      ofsupport, and become fractured, and therefore
much more liable           give out gas, which gas
                             to                              well known      (it   is

                                                              in its
     experience) has sometimes found             way into the workings
far below,       as

some   of   the most serious accidents from fire-damp have been
occasioned. The greater the number, and the larger the size
                                                                       lie
of  the upper seams, and the nearer they                the seam which to
is  worked       atlower level, the greater the risk          such com             of

the   expense     of    a     had been   already   incurred, may never
be available after the workings have been for many years
abandoned, and the shaft partially filled up, and after the coal

    Before going into a particular consideration of the causes
of the late accident at Haswell, and the possible means of pre
venting the recurrence of the like in future, we wish to point
out the fact well known to the viewers in this district, that the
pits on the north side of the Wear, in which the Hutton seam
is worked, are more infested with fire-damp than those on the
south side of that river.               therefore,   If,  Haswell Colliery,         at
situated    among    the  latter,  the danger   has   proved              great,                       to   be   so
still more necessary will                   endeavour
                                              it      be       to
                                                              take additional             to
precautions elsewhere.
     There can           be    no
                          doubt, that       regards the safety  as     the men                              of
in   coal mines from injury consequent upon fire-damps, venti
lation     is   of
                 the utmost importance, but there                     practical                    is       a
limit   beyond    which       cannotit     carried,  for       be
                                                             works    deep  and           in
extensive,        the coal mines often are,
                    as                                 dig shaft after shaft    to

    These goafs grow to a great size”. There are three in the
Haswell Little Pit; two are small as yet; the largest has an
extent of 13 acres. At the edges they are very loose and open,
having accidental cavities and passages for air running into
them, as might be expected from the falling of rocks from a
height of five feet one upon another.          There is every reason
to believe, that the falling goes on towards the middle of the
goaf, but how high the heap of broken strata and the vault                                                              in

we are aware, even in a small one. The goaf may be consi
dered as a heap of rocky fragments rising up into the vault or
cavity from which it has fallen, perhaps nearly compact in the
parts which are the oldest, lowest, and nearest the middle,

 conflagration when the fire reaches them from an explosion
 in some other part of the mine: this appears to have been the
 case at the goaf of the High Brockley Whins working, on the
 occurrence of the Haswell event.
    We are bound from all the evidence, and from our own
 personal examination, to state on the part of the owners and
 officers of the Haswell Colliery, that, as far as the principles
 of ventilation in coal mines have been developed and applied,
 and in comparison with the general practice of the trade, the
 Little Pit appears to have been most admirably ventilated.
 No expense seems to have been spared in the first setting out
 of the works, or in carrying them through, or in the daily ar
 rangements under ground; and this care was further favoured
 by the natural circumstances of the mine, the seam of coal
 being very regular, having a strong shale roof or ceiling, and
 with scarcely any fault. The mine has the character of being
 one of the best ventilated in the whole trade, a circumstance
 which, though it leads us in the fullest degree to exonerate the
 owners and officers from all blame in reference to the late ter
 rible event, makes us more anxious, if possible, to discover                                                 its
 cause, and suggest some practical guard against           recurrence                     its
in   future.    With this intention, and without going into the
 ventilation generally, we will state our view            effect    the         of    its                at

     The recent terrible event appears to         have originated at the
 Meadows Flat      workings,     at a  point  near to the upper edge of
      goaf  concavity,         place     where a jud was in the act of
                                                                                                       -

 men, were engaged in this work at the time of the accident;
all were killed, and the jud has since been named after                                       Wil
 liamson.     All the evidence derivable from the way in which
 the stoppings were blown, the charring of the posts, and the
 adhesion of charred coal dust to them on this or that side, as
also to the walls of the mine and edges of the irregularities of
 the walls, confirm this view in the opinion of practical men,
 the viewers of the mines, and with this conclusion the results
 of our own close inspection perfectly agree. At this place
 Davy lamps were found. The state of the gauze indicated
 that they had been in good condition prior to the accident,
but two of them were much crushed and bruised, and one of
                           plug out; this and the fourth were pro

for from the powerful draught in the return of the Haswell
Works, we are at present fully persuaded, that if the goaf
ventilation pipe, of the size proposed, simply entered the up
cast shaft, there would be draught enough to draw away the
atmosphere of the goaf.           It is true, that if the atmosphere in
the goaf vault, to which the end of the pipe might penetrate,
were pure fire-damp, we should have to consider                      lightness,                                its

viz. that Mr. Kemp neutralizes his solution cold, while Sir                                              J.
Herschel recommends the neutralization to be performed at a
boiling temperature, a precaution which, as will appear on a
perusal of the paper in question, is by no means to be neg
lected when amathematically rigorous separation of the oxides
is desired.
   Mr. Kemp also notices that where cheapness is an object,
carbonate of soda may be substituted for that of ammonia.
Sir   J.
       Herschel has shown that any earthy or metallic carbo
nate will equally answer the purpose, so that (for the prepara
tion of the sulphate at least, for manufacturing purposes)
chalk would be that substance to which the manufacturer
would resort, as no harm can arise from adding it in any
excess, and the small quantity of sulphate of lime remaining
in solution would be readily separated by evaporation to dry
ness and redissolution. An experiment is related in the paper
                   to, very minute per-centage

   Analysis of the Bornine    of Brazil (Telluret of Bismuth), by
                           M. A. Damour.
    The bornine, the analysis of which I present, is in mica
ceous laminae having the brilliancy of polished steel, slightly
flexible, and very thin; heated on charcoal it fuses, becoming
surrounded with a white ring and a green ring, and finally
disappears in the pores of the charcoal.
    In the open tube it fuses on the first application of heat,
disengages a sulphurous smell, then white fumes of oxide of
tellurium, and toward the close of the operation a marked
smell of selenium. In the upper part of the tube a white crust
is observed surmounted by a light brick-red layer, attributable
to the condensation of the selenium. The lower part of the
tube remains covered with a yellowish residue of oxide of bis
muth.

    In taking the number 1330'376, adopted by M.M. Regnault
and Rose, as the atomic weight of bismuth, and that of 802. 131
for the atomic weight of tellurium, the preceding results might
be expressed by the formula
                          BiºS2 + 3 Biº Te.
    This composition differs considerably from the results ob
tained by MM. Berzelius and Wehrle for the bornine of
Chemnitz, as well as those which the bornine of Deutsch
 Pilsen yielded to the latter chemist.
    These differences might perhaps lead us to adopt three
species of bornine, but we rather think that, if tellurium
and bismuth can combine in exact proportions, they may also
 combine in very variable quantities.      To decide this delicate
 question—one too which occurs with many metallic minerals
 —it is necessary to wait until crystals of bornine combine the
 two characters which determine the formation of mineral spe
 cies, namely the atomic composition and the crystalline form.

40     Memoir   of the late Francis Baily, Esq., F.R.S.,   &c.
not destined to reach without twice incurring the most immi
 nent danger from shipwreck, both on our own coast, under
 most awful circumstances, on the Goodwin Sands, and off
 New York, which he was prevented from reaching, being
 driven to sea in a gale, and, after endeavouring in vain to
 reach Bermuda, was driven into Antigua, whence he subse
  quently embarked for Norfolk in Virginia.
    In America he remained one or two years, travelling over
 the whole of the United States and through much of the west
 ern country; in which travel he experienced, at various times,
  much hardship and privation, having, as     I remember to have
  heard him state in conversation (and which must have re
 ferred to this period of his life), passed eleven months without
 the shelter of a civilized roof.    During his residence in Ame
 rica he was not unmindful of his intellectual and social im
 provement, having not only read much and observed much,
 as a copious journal which he transmitted home proves, but
 formed the acquaintance of some eminent persons, among
 whom may be mentioned Mr. Ellicot, the Surveyor-General
 of the United States, from whom he obtained some curious
 information bearing on the periodical displays of meteors on
 the 12th of November, of which that gentleman observed a su
perb instance in 1799, and from whom it is not impossible he
 may have acquired a taste for observations of a more distinctly
 astronomical and geographical nature.
    Whatever may have been the more direct object of this
journey, if indeed it had any other than to gratify a youthful
inclination for travel and adventure, it does not appear to have
exercised any material influence on his after-life, since, on his
return to England, in place of immediately entering into busi
ness, he continued to reside for some time with his parents at
Newbury, which, however, at length he quitted for London,
to engage in business as a stock-broker, being taken into part
nership by Mr. Whitmore of the Stock Exchange.                 The
exact date of this partnership I have not been able to learn:
I  believe it to have been 1801 ; but that it must have been
prior to 1802, may be concluded from the subject of his first
publication, which appeared in that year, viz. ‘Tables for the
Purchasing and Renewing of Leases for Terms of Years cer
tain and for Lives, with Rules for determining the Value of
the Reversions of Estates after any such Leases.’ This work
(as well as the next) is preceded by a highly practical and
useful Introduction, and followed by an Appendix, which
shows, that at the age of twenty-eight he had become well
versed in the works of the English mathematicians, and had
also consulted those of foreign ones.       It speedily attained a

certainly at that time begun to fall considerably behind the
requisitions of astronomical, and even of nautical science,
were those with which he may be said to have commenced his
more active astronomical career. But I wish to call attention
at present to two pamphlets which he published in 1818 and
1819 respectively, which will afford occasion for some remarks
of moment. The first of these is a notice of the annular eclipse
of September 20, 1820, whose path lay along the whole medial
line of Europe from north to south. Two points in this tract
merit our attention.        In it he adopts a practice, which he sub
sequently on a great many occasions adhered                    introducing      to,   of

    out the idea into a wide and most useful field; and in the
    Catalogue of the Astronomical Society he has put the astro
    nomical world in possession of a power which may be said,
    without exaggeration, to have changed the face of sidereal
    astronomy, and must claim for him the gratitude of every ob
    server. It detracts nothing from the merit of Mr. Baily, or
    from his claim to be considered the author of this precious
    work, that the numerical computations were chiefly executed
    by Mr. Stratford, and the expenses borne by the Astronomical
    Society.     The conception was              his own, and the work pre

    the commencement of the nineteenth century are remarkable
    for the small amount of scientific movement going on in this
    country, especially in          more exact departments.

on upwards of eighty pendulums of various forms and mate
rials, by which the new correction is clearly shown to depend
not only on the dimensions but on the form and situation of
the vibrating body.         Independent of the excellence of this
paper as a specimen of delicate experimental inquiry and                               in
duction, in which, to use the expression of one best capable of
appreciating and admiring them, his generalizing powers seem
to have been held in abeyance till the right moment for their
exercise arrived, it had the further merit of bringing into                            di
stinct notice a number of minute circumstances, chiefly rela
tive to the mode of suspension (important, however, from their
influence on results), which it is absolutely necessary to attend
to in these delicate and difficult inquiries, if the pendulum be
ever again resorted to as a means of verifying or fixing anew
the standard of length.
    The return of the Chanticleer in 1831, without its lamented
commander, threw the whole task of arranging and digesting
for publication Captain Foster's pendulum observations on
 Mr. Baily—a labour of love, prompted by the warmest friend
ship, and which he executed in the spirit of one determined to
erect a monument to the fame of that truly amiable and ta
lented officer, of the most durable and precious materials.
 His Report on the subject to the Admiralty was presented by
the Lords Commisioners to the Council of the Astronomical
 Society, and printed at the expense of Government as the
 seventh volume of our Transactions.             In this Report the ob
 servations are given in         full, and with the most scrupulous
 fidelity, and those at each of the numerous stations discussed
 with the utmost care. The final re-examination of the pen
 dulums in London was also personally executed by Mr. Baily,
 and the whole series of stations combined into a general result,
 which gives for the ellipticity of the earth HHHH. Not con
 tent with this, he has here also collected into one synoptic view
                                                   of all
 the results obtained at various stations            over the globe with
 the invariable pendulum,       by    observers             all
                                                        nations,            so    as    to
 place them    in comparison with each other, and           deduce from
                                                                  to
 them  a  general   result.     Of  these,   by far the most numerous
 and prominent,     in  every respect, are those             of
                                                         our own coun
 trymen, Captains Foster and Sabine; and nothing can                                    be
 more gratifying,    in  estimating our own national share             this     in
 sublime   application    of science,  than   tofind these  principal   au
 thorities, whose observations were made and reduced with the

    Standard of Length.-From the pendulum to the standard
of length, or the fixation of the scientific unit, the transition is
easy, and, in Mr. Baily's case, was unavoidable.            For, being
once satisfied by experience of the innumerable minute circum
stances on which perfect precision in these inquiries depends,
and finding the parliamentary enunciation of the relation be
tween the conventional and natural standards nullified, as it
were, under his eye, he felt himself irresistibly urged to                                      in
quire how far the conventional unit itself might be depended
upon, and within what limits of error it might certainly be re
produced in copies.       His first step in this direction was to
obtain the most perfect possible representative of this unit,
and (as the Astronomical Society was now identified with                                        al
most   all his undertakings) justly considering the possession                                   of
         standard by that body           thing    itself desirable, and

sources      error which influence these delicate measurements,

 error can    possibly              be

                                             which rude and ignorant
 hands had irrecoverably marred some                those refined proof

               human workmanship, which ought not even                                      to   be

of some communications on the subject between Mr. Baily,
Mr. Bethune, and the Astronomer Royal, the latter was in
duced to draw the attention of Government to the subject, an
occasion having arisen which rendered the mention in an offi
cial form unavoidable.       And on the 11th of May of the same
year a commission was appointed, consisting of seven” mem
bers (Mr. Baily being one), to report on the course most ad
visable to be pursued under these circumstances. To this
duty, which involved the hearing of a vast deal of evidence and
much personal attendance, Mr. Baily gave his unceasing at
tention; suggesting many valuable points, both practical and
theoretical; and, on the Report of the Commission bein
agreed on, and the practical formation of new standards, in
conformity with the view therein taken of the subject, being
referred by Government to the same commissioners, Mr. Baily
undertook, to the general satisfaction of the whole body, and
at their particular request, the delicate and important task of
reconstructing the standard of length—a task which, unhap
pily, he did not live to complete. On whomsoever may de
 volve the completion of this standard, it will be satisfactory to
 the members of this Society to know that, among the evidence
 adduced for          its
                     restoration, the scale prepared for            Mr.       it   by

 pendulum were hardly brought to a conclusion when he was
 led to enter upon this subject, the immediate occasion of his
 doing so being an incidental suggestion at the council-table by
 Mr. De Morgan, of the desirableness of repeating the expe
 riment of Cavendish *—a suggestion immediately seconded
 both by the Astronomer Royal and by Mr. Baily. The ex
 perience of the latter had shown him how indispensably ne
 cessary, in such inquiries, are extensive repetition and variation
 of circumstance. The Schehallien experiment, from                     very                                             its

ill-understood disturbing causes, set themselves in opposing
array in their most recondite and unexpected forms of inter
ference. Nor could it have been overlooked by him that it
was necessary, not merely to do over again what Cavendish
had done before him, a thing in itself not easy, but to do it
much more thoroughly and effectually.
    Mr. Baily, however, was not to be discouraged by such
considerations.  He saw that there existed a blank in our list
of exact data which it was necessary to fill, and he felt himself
in possession of those gifts of nature and position which en
abled him to fill       Accordingly

minutely into a discussion of these experiments, there is one
point in their conduct which I cannot pass over in silence.
The experiments had been carried on for eighteen months, a
vast number of preliminary trials had been made, and upwards
of 1000 registered results obtained, when it became apparent
 that the coincidence of Cavendish's results, one with another,
 was rather to be attributed to the paucity of his trials than to
 any especial accuracy in his observations or felicity in his mode
 of operating.      Even in the few experiments made by Caven
dish, discordances had shown themselves, of which no account
could be given other than by reference to the movements of
 included air; but, on Mr. Baily's extensive scale of operation,
the limits of disagreement obviously arising from this cause
 became so enormous as to render it hardly possible to draw
any line for the reception and rejection of results.           In fact, at
one   period   he had almost      begun    to  despair  of bringing    the
matter to any positive conclusion.          The happy suggestion of
 Mr. Forbes, to gild the torsion-box and leaden balls, at once
dispelled         all
                this vagueness and uncertainty, and reduced the
results       high
             toa      degree     uniformity#.of    Most experimenters
would have been content           reject  the discordant results. Mr.
                                                 to
 Baily unhesitatingly sacrificed the whole and began anew,

without appearing          regard with to     instant's regret the time

to  him for this    important   memoir.

 from grievous misapprehension and misstatement.
     In 1832 it happened, by a most singular coincidence, that
 Mr. Baily became aware of the existence, in the possession of
 his opposite neighbour in the same street, E. Giles, Esq., of
 the whole of Flamsteed's autograph letters to Abraham Sharp,
 and was permitted to peruse and copy them. Their perusal
 convinced him that Flamsteed's life, astronomical labours, and
 personal character, had never been fairly placed before the
 world, and induced him to examine with care the mass of his
 papers preserved (or rather neglected and mouldering) at
 Greenwich.        His first care was to arrest the progress of their
 further    decay.   His next, to avail himself of the original en
 tries of the observations, and of the manuscript records of the
 computations founded on them, to trace out the sources, and
 to rectify the numerous errors and inconsistencies of the                                     ‘Bri
tish Catalogue’ as it then stood before the world, and to pre

we consider that the volume extends to nearly 800 pages

examination and selection of the letters and other biographi

and responsibility; and that the preface, which contains Mr.
 Baily's own summary of Flamsteed's life, the introduction to
 the Catalogue and the Supplement, in further vindication of

 favourable circumstances at Jedburgh, noticed a very singular
phaenomenon      attending the formation of the annulus. I mean
the  appearance    of beads of light, alternating finally with long,
 straight, dark threads, cutting across the narrow line of the
 sun's limb, which he described in a highly interesting paper
 read to this Society on the 9th of December, 1836. On the
 occasion of the total eclipse he selected Pavia for his station,
 that town lying in the path of the centre of the shadow.
 There, by especial good fortune, he obtained an excellent
 view of   it,and there             he
                             witnessed, not only     repetition    the         a                      of

tific works of Mr. Baily, and noticing, as we cannot help doing,
the gradual expansion of his views, and the progressively in
creasing importance of the objects they embraced, we are na
turally led to ask by what means he was enabled thus to live
as it were two distinct lives, each so active and successful, yet
so apparently incompatible with each other? how, in what is
generally regarded as the decline of life, he could not only ac
complish so much with such apparent ease to himself, but go
on continually opening out wider and wider plans of useful
exertion in a manner which seems only to belong to the fresh

 fect simply because nothing is protuberant.              Equal to every
 occasion which arose, either in public or private life, yet, when
 not called forth, or when others occupied the field, content to
 be unremarked; to speak of his conduct as unassuming would
 convey but a faint idea of the perfect simplicity with which he
 stood aside from unnecessary prominence or interference.
    Hardly less inadequate would it be to say of his temper that,
 always equable and cheerful, it was a source of peace and hap
 piness to himself and others.          It was much more, it was a
 bond of kindness and union to all around him, and infused an
 alacrity of spirit into every affair in which the cooperation of
 others was needed, which was more than a simple reflex of his
own good humour.           It rendered every relation between him
self and others easy and natural, and brought out                the latent             all

 his powers, and on which they could be, on the whole, most
 availably and usefully employed.                Both in his public and
 private capacity he was liberal and generous in the extreme,
  and both his purse and his influence were ever ready, whether
  to befriend merit, or to promote objects of public, and espe
  cially of scientific utility.
     To term Mr. Baily a man of brilliant genius or great                              in
  vention, would in effect be doing him wrong. His talents were
 great, but rather solid and sober than brilliant, and such as
 seized their subject rather with a tenacious grasp than with a
  sudden pounce.        His mind, though perhaps not excursive,
  was   yet  always   in progress, and by industry, activity, and
  using to advantage every ray of light as it broke in upon his
 path, he often accomplished what is denied to the desultory
 efforts of more imaginative men. Whatever he knew he knew
 thoroughly, and enlarged his frontier by continually stepping
 across the boundary and making good a new and well-marked
 line between the cultivation within and the wilderness without.
  But the frame of his mind, if not colossal, was manly in the
 largest sense. Far-sighted, clear-judging, and active; true, ster
 ling, and equally unbiassed by partiality and by fear; upright,
 undeviating, and candid, ardently attached to truth, and deem
 ing no sacrifice too great for          attainment;-these are quali
                                             its
 ties which throw what           called
                                   is    genius,    when unaccompanied,
or   but  partially  accompanied,      with  them,    quite into the shade.

the reasoning in my last paper; had he done so, I should have
had a chance of obviating them on his own ground, but as it
is I am left entirely in the dark respecting them; and unhap
pily the darkness is in no measure dispelled by the cloud of
mystery in which his last paper has enveloped the subject.
     Imust now notice Mr. Cayley's logic in the 16th No. of
the Cambridge Mathematical Journal.           He was at liberty to
make u = w, or any other quantity; and in so doing he must
determine the true value of C, if he proceeded by a right
method. How then does it happen that for two forms of whe
obtains faulty or indeterminate results, no results as he calls
them? Plainly because the forms of w were faulty, not from
any fault in the denominator.                                If
                                      Jacobi's denominator would

mition  of the logometer is not the most general. Take any two lines
whatsoever passing through the origin, and style them the bases of
length and direction.    Set off on the first a line representing the
logarithm of the length in question, and on the second a line repre
senting the angle it makes with the unit-axis, both on any scale of
representation.    Then the diagonal of the parallelogram described
on the lines just set off is a logometer to the length and direction
from which it was derived; and if under this meaning of the word
logometer the preceding definition of                                A”    be employed, the equations

  PREPAIRATION          OF FERRATE OF POTASH IN THE MOIST WAY.
    When a current of chlorine gas is passed into a concentrated solu
tion of potash containing suspended hydrated sesquioxide of iron, M.
Fremy states that the liquid soon assumes a fine purplish-red colour,
and the sesquioxide of iron is dissolved; when the potash is greatly
 in excess, a blackish powder is precipitated ; this is merely ferrate
of potash, which is insoluble in the alkali. The ferrate thus precipi
tated carries with it considerable quantities of chloride of potassium ;
in order to purify               it,

oxides do not lose their oxygen: metals produce the same effect as
the oxides, in accelerating the decomposition of the ferrate of potash
in solution; the hypochlorites impart stability to the ferrate of pot
 ash, for a mixture of ferrate of potash and an alkaline hypochlorite
 is very slowly altered by ebullition, whereas pure ferrate of potash
is instantly decomposed by a temperature of 212°F. Excess of
 chlorine decomposes ferrate of potash, and the same happens with
 ammonia, which disengages azote and precipitates sesquioxide of iron.
    All acids decompose ferrate of potash; the ferric acid set free is
 immediately decomposed into oxygen and sesquioxide of iron, which
 dissolves in the acid when in excess; the solution becomes com
                                -
 pletely colourless.    Acids which are susceptible of superoxidizement
absorb the nascent oxygen.
    The instantaneous decoloration of ferrate of potash by the action
of acids, is a property which immediately distinguishes ferrate from
permanganate of potash.
    Hydrochloric acid decomposes ferrate of potash, forming chloride
of iron and disengaging chlorine ; organic substances also react upon
and decompose the ferrate of potash, in which respect it resembles
the manganates and permanganates.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., No
vember 1844.
                         HYDRATED IODIC ACID.
    M. Millon remarks that the action of nitric acid upon iodine de
pends on the degree of hydratation of the acid.
    Nitric acid combined with 4 equivalents of water, or that which
contains more, does not oxidize iodine; it dissolves in them when
heated, and produces a violet colour, but is deposited on cooling
without the formation of any iodic acid. This refusal to oxidize is
explained by an interesting phaenomenon presented by nitric acid, of
this degree of hydratation, in contact with iodic acid itself. The
iodic acid dissolves in it without any apparent reaction; but if a few
bubbles of nitric oxide be passed into the solution, the nitrous acid
formed soon reduces the iodic acid, and iodine separates.     The iodine
cannot undergo oxidizement by weak nitric acid without producing
a nitrous compound; but this reducing the iodic acid, the iodine
exists in weak nitric acid, between two equal contrary forces, whic
                                                                       -
produce inertia.
    When nitric acid contains two or three equivalents of water it oxi
dizes iodine with the assistance of heat. The nitrous products then
formed do not react upon the iodic acid, and it is formed as long as
the acid is sufficiently concentrated.    The iodic acid separates in
white mammillated crystals, which, whatever may be the degree
of concentration of the acid, always contain one third of an equiva
lent of water : its formula is 3 IO* +HO.     It is insoluble in alcohol,
and is perfectly free from any combination with nitric acid.
    The concentration of the nitric acid requisite to the oxidizement
of iodine, explains satisfactorily why Sérullas succeeded in effecting
it by means of a mixture of nitric and nitrous acids. The latter
mixing with hydrated nitric acid, in fact introduced anhydrous nitric
acid, and diminished the degree of hydratation.

      M. Millon      states that when  nitric acid which is not too nitrous, and
contains less than 2       equivalents     of water, is saturated with iodine,
it is oxidized without the assistance of heat.
   The nitric acid should be pure ; and although the iodine of com
merce when finely pulverized will answer the purpose, it is better
to employ precipitated iodine, obtained by mixing solutions of chlo
ride of iodine and potash. The iodine ought to be carefully washed
and dried at the usual temperature of the air; then put into a glass                                                         .

acid containing one or two equivalents of water; triturate the mix

powder is formed : the trituration is to be continued for some time,
and if    allthe iodine has not evidently been acted upon, the acid                                                    is

     ACTION of IoDINE ON CERTAIN SALTs.             By M. FILHol.
    Several years since M. Berthemot produced, for the first time, a
compound of iodine and lead possessing a fine blue colour; it was
mentioned rather later by M. Denot, and it has been more recently
examined by M. Durand.
    In order to determine its chemical composition, M. Filhol first
examined that of the solutions which are used in forming it; this
included the action exerted by iodine on carbonates; the results
 showed that iodine acting in the cold upon the alkaline carbonates,
 forms bicarbonate of the base, an iodide and iodate.
    By the action of a solution of bi-iodide of potassium upon a solu
 tion of acetate of lead, a violet-red coloured precipitate was formed,
which was very unstable; when heated to 230°F. it loses 26.66
per cent., or 1 equivalent of iodine, and leaves a residue of I*Pb.
 +PbO. If care be taken not to heat the compound to above 230°,
the residue is of a fine green colour; but if the temperature be raised
to 266° or 284°, the green colour is lost, and it becomes of a pale
yellow without losing a trace of iodine. The composition of the
red powder is such, that it may be considered as formed of bi-iodide
of lead combined with oxide of lead (2I*--Pb)+PbO, or as formed
 of I*Pb-i-I2PbO.
    When treated with  excess of acetic acid this powder is decom
posed; iodine separates, some oxide of lead combines with the acetic
acid, and the residue is a new oxi-iodide of lead composed of 2I*
+ PbO.
   M. Filhol states that this red powder is one of the constituents
of the blue compound, and that it may be produced by mixing the
red powder while moist with nascent carbonate of lead; or, which is
better, by employing a solution which produces both at the same
time; the blue powder constitutes a compound of a new class, and
the author proposes for it the name of iodo-carbonate of lead; it is
obtained of a very fine colour by precipitating a solution of acetate
of lead, with one formed of 1 proportion of bi-iodide of potassium
and 4 of carbonate of potash.
  The analysis of the blue compound gave the following as        for                              its
mula: I*Pb-HI-PbO--4 (CO-PbO).                                                                      -

ON    A   NEW COMPOUND OF SULPHUR, CHLORINE AND OXYGEN.
     M. Millon,       in   attempting several             years ago         to   combine      a   larger
proportion     chlorine with sulphur than had been previously done,
                of
remarked the formation         crystalline compound which
                                      ofa                     supposed                   he
to consist entirely    sulphur and chlorine.

substance repeatedly, the author found that       was obtained     proit                      in
portion    to                    of                    of the moisture

was obtained in considerable quantity; the analysis was then under
taken, and besides a large proportion of oxygen, certain interesting
properties were discovered with respect to the isomeric transforma
tion of mineral compounds.
    The new compound is immediately obtained by dropping chloride
of sulphur into a moist bottle containing moist chlorine. Too large
a quantity of moisture would immediately destroy this compound,
or would retard its production; but under the circumstances de
scribed, the bottle soon becomes covered with colourless transparent
crystals, which attach themselves to the sides.           It is not always
possible to detach the compound thus spread in thin laminae, and
which the moist air destroys rapidly.         To prepare the compound in
considerable   quantity,   a bottle, capable of containing 8 to 10 pints, is
to be filled with moist chlorine, and then there are to be added to it
from 300 to 450 grains of chloride of sulphur, quite saturated with
chlorine, and afterwards 30 to 45 grains of water. The bottle is to
be shaken and surrounded with a mixture of salt and ice for four or
five hours.    A great disengagement of hydrochloric acid takes place;
the bottle is to be again filled with moist chlorine and again im
mersed into the freezing mixture: these operations are to be repeated
until the chloride of sulphur becomes an abundant crystalline mass,
containing an excess of the chloride.        The formation of these cry
stals, which are either fine needles or large rhombic laminae, is
usually preceded by the production of a yellowish liquid, heavier
than the chloride of sulphur, and from which it separates like an oil.
    It is very difficult to separate the crystals from the chloride of
sulphur which they contain; it is effected by passing into the bottle,
during six to twelve hours, a current of chlorine gas dried over sul
phuric acid : at the same time that the chlorine is passing through
the bottle, the crystals are to be volatilized and made to pass from
one side of the bottle to the other by means of red-hot charcoal.
Notwithstanding this troublesome operation, the crystals always re
tain one or two per cent. of chloride of sulphur, which analysis dis
covers to be in proportion to the shortness of the time which the
chlorine is passed.
    It is scarcely possible to analyse these crystals immediately after
their production; they are in fact destroyed and projected with great
violence as soon as they are touched with water, alcohol or dilute acids.
To determine their composition, the author availed himself of an inter
esting property which they possess, and which is the following:—
when the crystals have been freed as much as possible from the chloride
of sulphur, they are made to drop into a very dry glass tube, closed at
 one end, and the other is drawn out by the lamp; in two or three
 months the crystals begin to soften, become pasty, moisten, and in
 six or eight months they are converted into an extremely thin liquid
 and of a scarcely perceptible yellow tint, when the current of chlorine
has been long continued.         No absorption takes place, and the liquid
 cannot be restored to the crystalline state even by exposure to a cold
of 2° below zero.       It is therefore an isomeric transformation, which
is shown, not only by the change of      its   physical but also of   its
                                                                       che

mical properties.    Thus the liquid when poured into water does not
produce the hissing noise of a red-hot iron plunged into water, as
the crystals do; it mixes quietly with weak acids, alcohol or water,
to the bottom of which it falls quietly like an oil, which is eventually
converted into sulphurous, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids.
   This transformation agrees perfectly with the analysis, which
shows it to be a compound of sulphur, chlorine and oxygen, repre
sented by S*O3Cl2.        It will be observed that it differs from the
chlorosulphuric acid discovered by M. Regnault, SO3Cl, and from
the liquid analysed by H. Rose, represented by S*O°Cl.
   As to the analysis of the above described compound, and which
M. Millon observes may be named hypochlorosulphuric acid, it will
be seen that it offers no difficulty as soon as it has assumed the
liquid form. It is sufficient to fill a weighed glass bubble with   which                                                          it,

94        Lieut.-Col. Sabine's Report on the Meteorology of Toronto.
a result totally irreconcileable with the phaenomena observed, and
sufficient to disprove (so far as in the face of the analytical difficulties
it presents can be disproved) the whole theory of secondary waves.
     Ifit be contended that Fresnel's integrals are correctly deduced, I
reply that they are so only by taking into account other terms in the
values of the sine and cosine                           of the arc 27
                                                                              A

in which s rises to the second power, and which we are not entitled
to do.
   For the effect of taking into account such additional terms must
be either sensible or insensible.                             If
                                         it is sensible, we are not justified
in  leaving out of consideration similar terms in calculating the value
of   f;if the effect is insensible, there is an end of Fresnel's explana
tion.

more useful, have compared the meteorological results obtained at Toronto
with those obtained by M. Kreil at the magnetical and meteorological obser
vatory at Prague in Bohemia”.     It is frequently found that we gain more by
such comparisons,—by the points of resemblance and points of difference,
and by the analogies and contrasts which they bring to our notice,—than we
do by a simple direct investigation.
   Prague like Toronto is situated at a considerable distance from the ocean
(between 300 and 400 miles) in the interior of a great continent, the latitude
and elevation moreover not being very dissimilar.     The agreement which
will be shown in the leading features of their meteorology manifests that
these features belong to a locality so circumstanced, whether the continent
be Europe or America; whilst the minor differences point to climatological
distinctions of a secondary order, important indeed to discuss from their
bearing on the health and occupations of mankind, as well as in more purely
scientific respects, but into which time will scarcely permit me to enter on
the present occasion beyond a mere notice of some of the facts.

the mean daily range of the thermometer is greater, being 9°-9 at Prague and
11°35 at Toronto. The mean temperature of the 24 hours occurs earlier in
the forenoon and earlier in the afternoon at Toronto than at Prague.

98     Lieut.-Col. Sabine's Report on the Meteorology of Toronto.
of January the wind from the east and north-east prevails in Europe, bring.
ing with it our severest winter cold. This feature has not a parallel in North
America, where the cold of winter is more equably distributed.        It would
 occupy too much time to discuss the cause of this peculiarity in the European
 climate; and I must content myself with referring generally to M. Dove's
elaborate work on the distribution of temperature; a work which cannot fail
to impress the reader strongly with the value of the conclusions to be derived
from long-continued series of observations subjected to a laborious and per
severing study.    It is a curious result from this excess of cold in Europe in
January, that notwithstanding the greater proportional warmth in summer
and cold in spring at Toronto, the extreme difference, or that between the
coldest and the warmest month of the year, is absolutely greater at Prague
than at Toronto, being 41°2 at Prague and 39°5 at Toronto.
    It is a consequence of the minor differences already pointed out, that a
temperature equal to that of the mean temperature of the year occurs later
in spring and earlier in autumn at Toronto than at Prague; and that the tem
perature is higher than the mean of the year during seven months at Prague,
whilst at Toronto it is only so during five months.
  I have inserted in the next table the mean range of the thermometer during
three years at Toronto and at Prague.       It must be understood that the
maximum of each month inserted in this table is the mean maximum during
three years; viz. March 1840 to March 1843 at Toronto; July 1839 to July
1842 at Prague; and the same is to be understood of the minimum : the
range is consequently a mean range during three years, and is of course ex
ceeded by the range in individual years.

   Here also the general character shown by the comparison of the two sta
tions is that of very close resemblance, while the minor differences also stand
out prominently.     The greater variation to which the temperature is subject
at Toronto in March and April is very obvious in the column of range; as is
also the small amount of the variation in the month of November at Prague.
The mean monthly range deduced from the twelve months is 43°-9 at Toronto,
and 39°7 at Prague; a considerable amount of difference, and which marks
the greater general vicissitude of the climate of Toronto: still it is deserving
of notice that Prague is occasionally liable to fully as great, and (during these
three years at least) even greater extremes of temperature than Toronto, as is
shown by the memorandum at the foot of the table; it is indeed curious to
remark how very nearly the stations approach each other in the extreme
amount of their thermometrical range. July and August are the only months
in which during three years the observations at Toronto never show a tem
perature of the air so low as the freezing point.      At Prague there are five
months, viz. from May to September inclusive, in which during the three
years the temperature was never observed so low as 32°.
  If  we seek in the old continent a station most nearly isothermal with To
ronto, we must refer to a latitude considerably higher than Prague.      The
station in M. Mahlmann's list (Dove, Repertorium, b. 4, and Humboldt, Asie
Centrale, tom. 3.), which most nearly resembles it in the mean temperature
of the different seasons, as well as in that of the whole year, is Wexic in
Sweden, in latitude 56° 53', and height above the sea 450 Parisian feet.
Toronto is in 43°39', and height above the sea 330 English feet. The mean
temperatures are—

at Trevandrum, in the East Indies, where the zeal of our indefatigable
associate Mr. Caldecott, Director of the Magnetical and Meteorological Ob
servatory established by His Highness the Rajah of Travancore, has already
accumulated, reduced, and transmitted to England five years of hourly obser
vations with the wet and dry thermometers, the maximum and minimum of
the tension are found to occur within three hours of each other; the mini
mum coinciding with the coldest hour, viz. at 6 A.M.; but the maximum
occurring at 9 in the forenoon.   This may possibly be a consequence of the
sea breeze, which springs up as the sun gains power, and as the earth warmed
by the solar rays heats the air in contact with itself and causes it to rise, occa
sioning an inpouring of the air from over the surface of the ocean. The sea
breeze brings an influx of fresh air charged with vapour; the air in               turn                                                                                  its

in the indications of the barometer, we cannot fail to be immediately struck
with the very close correspondence of the diurnal march before our eyes with
that of the temperature which we have already examined. The maximum
of pressure is at 6 A.M.; the minimum at 2 P.M., The progressions take place
in the opposite or inverse       sense to each other, but they are remarkably har
monious, and leave no doubt of a mutual connexion, and of the dependence
either of the one on the other, or of both on a common cause.
    An explanation of this connexion, which presents itself to the mind as soon
as the facts are clearly perceived, may be thus stated:—As the temperature of
the day increases, the earth becomes warmed and imparts heat to the air in
contact with                 it,
                    and causes         ascend. The column

106         Lieut.-Col. Sabine's Report on the Meteorology of Toronto.
much nearer to an equality in the two seasons of summer and winter, than do
those of the barometer. A north-west wind at Toronto is usually accompanied
by a rise in the barometer and a fall in the temperature with a diminution in
the tension of vapour; and a south or south-east wind, by a fall in the baro
meter and a rise in the thcrmometer with an increased tension of vapour.
In a change from one of these winds to the other, consequently, the alteration
of the gaseous pressure would be greater than that of the barometric pressure,
which is partially counteracted by the accompanying change in the elastic
force of the vapour:... and as already noticed, the fluctuations in the vapour
pressure are very considerable in summer. I have selected some remarkable
instances in a single year, 1841, which are as follows:—

If the principles  are correct, of which we have here traced a portion of the
consequences, barometrical observations generally must lose an essential part
of their value when unaccompanied by hygrometrical observations, by means
of which the pressures of the air and vapour may be separated.            Whenever
                                                                                                                                |
such complete observations are made, i.e. hygrometric as well as barometric,
the tension of vapour should be computed on the spot and at the instant.
When calculations of this nature are suffered to fall in arrear, unreduced
observations accumulate, and danger is incurred that the calculations are
never made, and that science will lose the advantage which the observations
were capable of affording.
   The comparison of the barometric range in the different months at Toronto
and Prague exhibits a very satisfactory accordance, and shows how similar
are the phaenomena which present themselves in this respect over the two
continents.
   The comparison of the range of the vapour pressure at Prague and Toronto
exhibits only such differences as may be reasonably ascribable to the greater
range of the temperature at Toronto, and possibly to the greater facility with
which the air can acquire vapour at that station from the great lakes in                                                  its
vicinity.

 tively profitless study of the complex effect produced on the barometer by the
 operation of these two distinct agencies.       The labour has been by no means
 small which has been bestowed in the endeavour to generalise the diurnal
 phaenomena of the barometer by the formation of empirical formulae; it has
 been in many instances the labour of highly accomplished men: but we
 have the recent acknowledgment of a valued and distinguished member of
 our own body", who has himself engaged in this inquiry, that it failed in
 conducting to a recognition of the causes of the phaenomena.           On the other
 hand, the moment we apply ourselves to the contemplation of the separate
 phaenomena of the vapour and of the air, there appears to be revealed to
 us a simple and beautiful dependence of each upon the diurnal march of the
 temperature, producing effects which in their combination seem also to
 afford a full and perfect solution of the problem of the daily rise and fall of
 the barometric column.
    It would be unjust to the meteorologists of Germany if we were not grate
 fully to acknowledge in how great a degree this advance in the science is to be
ascribed to their writings, and especially to those of M. Dove.           Their mete
 orological researches have been pressed with an assiduity and devotion of
labour which is beyond                all

108     Lieut.-Col. Sabine's Report on the Meteorology of Toronto.
   Prague and Toronto furnish the materials for an interesting comparison
of their respective mean gaseous pressures. I have exhibited this comparison
in the subjoined table. After the proper corrections have been applied for
the reduction to an invariable scale of pressure, and of the pressure itself to
a common elevation above the sea, the residual difference in the pressure is
about four hundredths of an inch. This is within the amount of difference
that might reasonably be expected in so indirect a comparison.     The infer:
ence therefore at present must be, that no unaccounted for difference of
pressure exists, or at least next to none, at these two stations in Europe

  Modern    researches have shown that the height of the barometer at dif.
ferent  points  of the earth's surface is not only disturbed by self-adjusting
causes which produce temporary displacements, but that there are causes in
action which effect persistent differences in the mean height of the barometer
in different localities, strictly at the level of the sea; so that, to use the
words of Bessel, the mean atmospheric pressure depends on the geographical
co-ordinates of a station in latitude and longitude as well as in elevation.
This remark of Bessel's is founded chiefly on Erman's observations* ; and
Erman himself, who has considered the effect of the vapour pressure upon                                             his
barometrical heights, concludes that the pressures which the air would have
exerted without the presence        aqueous vapour, indicate also persistent dif.

     An inference of much practical utility to general observers may be drawn
from meteorological observations, made with the frequency which can only
be expected at those observatories, where a sufficient establishment is main
tained for the express purpose of observation.   We may find that compara
tively a very few observations in each day, at hours not inconvenient in ordi
nary life, may furnish    a very close approximation to the mean values and to the
annual and diurnal march of the atmospherical phaenomena.           Thus from the
complete record at Toronto we find, as shown in the subjoined table, that the
mean values of the temperature, of the vapour tension and of the humidity, of
the pressure of the gaseous atmosphere, and of the whole atmospheric pressure,

                                             received from Mr. Airy the
volume of the Greenwich  magnetical and   meteorological observations for
1842, in which the meteorological reductions have been made in almost
exactly the same form as those of Toronto.      The volume was accompanied
by a suggestion from the Astronomer Royal, that it might increase the interest
of this communication, if I were to add a few words by way of appendix,
showing the points of similarity or dissimilarity in the results at the two
stations. I have much pleasure in adopting this suggestion, and in availing
myself of Mr. Airy's permission to do so; for I have had great satisfaction
in noticing the very remarkable similarity which prevails in the results at
Greenwich and Toronto, with reference to several points which have been
the objects of especial notice in the preceding discussion. In the diurnal
variations of the elastic force of the vapour-of the gaseous pressure,     and
of the force of the wind,-the evidence of a direct dependence on the diurnal
                                *
march of the temperature is fully as striking at Greenwich as at Toronto, as
will be seen by the following synopsis:

    AtGreenwich the force of the wind is estimated at each observation hour
in numbers varying within the limits of 0 to 6. At Toronto the estimation
is in lbs. pressure on a square foot of surface kept perpendicular to the
current. In single instances the scales are comparable, because the square of
the number expressing the force at Greenwich corresponds approximately to
the pressure in lbs. avoirdupois.    But the comparability of the scales does
not hold good when the sums of the forces and the sums of the pressures are
taken. The sums of each are however comparable inter             and show the             se,

   Secondly, in respect to the annual variation:
   The annual march is somewhat less regular at Greenwich than at
Toronto, being derived from the observations of a single year only ;
but we have the same general features: a minimum of temperature
and vapour pressure, and a maximum of gaseous pressure in the mid
winter; and a maximum of temperature and vapour pressure, and a
minimum of gaseous pressure in the midsummer. All the summer
months are characterised by the + sign in the vapour, and by the
— in the gaseous pressure; and         the winter months   all

medium, are abundantly sufficient for our purpose.
   26. By these experiments the following facts have been
clearly established:—
   1st. That when        pendulum, consisting
                                        a               ball suspended            of   a
 by    fine string,  oscillates        resisting   medium through
      a                                                an in                                                     a
small angle (for instance,          angle not exceeding 40), the
                                                          a

successive amplitudes of vibration are sensibly in geometric
progression.
   2nd. That the pendulum is deprived (so to speak) of a cer
tain portion of                                        by
                              it its

   Experiment shows that
                                                  * is       so small that        it may be alto
gether neglected in the expressions for n”; but the part of n”
depending upon q is by no means inconsiderable, being in
some cases as much as half of the whole correction due to the
buoyancy of the medium. We see then that the time of oscil
lation is only affected by that part of the resistance which de
pends upon the differential coefficients of the velocity; and this
proves that the resistance must sensibly depend upon the dif
ferential coefficients of the velocity, since the time of oscilla
tion is found to be sensibly altered by the resistance.
   31. The foregoing remarks are abundantly sufficient,                                                   I
think, to warrant the assumption we have been led to in article
19, namely, that the resistance brought into play upon the
vibrating aether is a linear function of the velocity and     dif                               its
ferential coefficients; and this    the only assumption that has

 XII.    On the Composition of some varieties of South American
    Guano; with the description of a new mode of estimating
    Ammonia, and        of a process for separating Lime from Mag
    nesia, when these earths ea'ist in combination with Phosphoric
    Acid.     By   J.  DENHAM SMITH, Esq.”
THE         results of the following examinations of guano, ne
       cessary as a matter of business to myself, may prove of
some interest to the Society, as they serve to confirm, in most
points, those arrived at by previous analysts, especially with
respect to the variableness of the composition of this substance.
          I
When commenced these analyses I had but one sample of
guano in my possession, which came through the hands of a
broker in 1842, of the purity of which I could not be certain
before analysis.        Subsequently     I  was successful in obtaining
genuine samples of South American guano direct from the
warehouses of the importers, the bulks from which these spe
cimens were taken being at the present time in the course of
consumption in this country.
    South American guano, as imported, presents itself in three
distinct states, although these varieties are often mixed toge
ther in the same bag. The larger proportion of it consists of
a damp pulverulent substance of various tints of brown, inter
mixed with nodules, usually of a lighter colour than the pow
der; some of these nodules are soft, easily crushed by the
finger, and often present light brown silky crystals when
broken ; others are much harder, of a dirty white and uniform
texture throughout.
   The second variety exists as large concretions, often weigh
ing several pounds, presenting various aspects when broken;
sometimes appearing merely to be the first variety in a cohe
rent, instead of a pulverulent state; at other times as a regu
larly stratified deposit of different shades.
                                  º
    The third description of guano occurs in irregularly shaped
masses, very heavy in comparison with the other varieties, and

124              Mr. Denham Smith                     on the Composition           of
termed “stones” by the labourers; when broken, this variety
presents a crystalline fracture, resembling a fused salt of a
brown colour; it appears to exist in large quantities in the
guano when imported, for at the warehouses whence I ob
tained my samples, I was told that at least a hundred tons of
it had been picked from the guano they had hitherto sent out
for consumption. For the sake of distinguishing this variety,
I  shall term it “Saline Guano,” whilst the second kind I shall
call “Concrete Guano.”
    After a preliminary qualitative examination of these varie
ties of this manure, the utility of another and probably more
exact mode of estimating ammonia than by condensing the
gas in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the solution to dry
ness, and a more oeconomical and less troublesome plan than
by a salt of platina, became obvious. I therefore had recourse
to an indirect method of analysis, that of estimating the am
monia from the quantity of carbonate of barytes obtained.                                            I
preferred a salt of barytes to any other substance forming a
true neutral carbonate, on account of the high atomic number
of barium, and                  its
                          consequent capability          expressing withof

to  a  salt   lime,

    The point which appeared most likely                   occasion errorto
was, that the carbonate                     of

dish for twenty-four hours: this precipitate, collected, washed
and dried, weighed 98-07 grs., indicating an excess of '012 in
estimating ammonia, merely an error of experiment to this
trifling amount. The solution when gently heated evolved a
little carbonic acid, but did not deposit any carbonate of ba
rytes. Satisfied by this experiment that the acid, as well as the
neutral carbonates of ammonia, precipitate a barytic salt equi
atomically as respects the bases, and therefore that the pro
posed plan of indirect estimation of ammonia was an accurate
one,   I  subjected 54 grs. of nuriate of ammonia to distillation
with an excess of a solution of the ordinary carbonate of soda,
carrying on the distillation until about one-half of the liquid
had passed into the receiver, in which distilled water was of
course placed; long before this quantity of liquid was distilled
a slip of turmeric paper suspended from the tubulure of the
retort ceased to be reddened; the contents of the receiver, a
solution of a basic carbonate of ammonia, were added to a so
lution of nitrate of barytes, and then subjected to a stream of
carbonic acid gas until the precipitate became arenaceous and
 the solution slightly affected litmus paper; this exposed to the
 airfor a day, and the precipitate collected, and dried, gave 97.63
 grs. of carbonate of barytes. As in the former case, the         fil
 tered solution when gently heated gave off a little carbonic acid
 gas, but deposited nothing. These results being so favourable,
 and the process simple, the trifling deficiency evidently being
 traceable to defective manipulation alone,     I have adopted this
 process for estimating ammonia in the analyses subsequently
 detailed, considering it susceptible of greater accuracy than
  the hydrochloric acid method, and as accurate as, and far less
 troublesome and expensive than, the employment of salts of
  platinum, and of alcohol for this purpose.
     The process for separating the phosphate of lime from the
  phosphate of magnesia depends upon the insolubility of the
  oxalate of lime in very dilute acetic acid, and the solubility of
  the magnesian salt in that menstruum.        Thus, when a solu
 tion of these mixed    phosphates  in  hydrochloric  acid is treated
  with ammonia slightly in excess to precipitate the charac
  teristic gelatinous precipitate, and acetic acid is gradually
  added till such precipitate is redissolved, the solution being
  acid to litmus paper, but only faintly so to the taste, oxalate
  of ammonia produces the characteristic precipitate of oxalate
  of lime, which base is completely thrown down; the filtered
   solution, when evaporated and treated with a little phosphate
   of soda and ammonia, affording the ammoniacal magnesian
   phosphate, which contains no lime.       I do not give this pro
   cess as one which is necessarily rigidly accurate, for if the

termed “stones” by the labourers; when broken, this variety
presents a crystalline fracture, resembling a fused salt of a
brown colour; it appears to exist in large quantities in the
guano when imported, for at the warehouses whence I ob
tained my samples,                   I
                          was told that at least a hundred tons of
it had   been picked from the guano they had hitherto sent out
for consumption. For the sake of distinguishing this variety,
I  shall term it “Saline Guano,” whilst the second kind I shall
call “Concrete Guano.”
    After a preliminary qualitative examination of these varie
ties of this manure, the utility of another and probably more
exact mode of estimating ammonia than by condensing the
gas in hydrochloric acid and evaporating the solution to dry
ness, and a more oeconomical and less troublesome plan than
by a salt of platina, became obvious. I therefore had recourse
to an indirect method of analysis, that of estimating the am
monia from the quantity of carbonate of barytes obtained.                                           I
preferred a salt of barytes to any other substance forming a
true neutral carbonate, on account of the high atomic number
of barium, and                 its
                        consequent capability          expressing with of
exactness the quantity         ammonia,   of   well      the great deli

             some varieties of South  American Guano.            125
dish for twenty-four hours: this precipitate, collected, washed
and dried, weighed 98.07 grs., indicating an excess of '012 in
estimating ammonia, merely an error of experiment to this
trifling amount. The solution when gently heated evolved a
little carbonic acid, but did not deposit any carbonate of ba
rytes. Satisfied by this experiment that the acid, as well as the
neutral carbonates of ammonia, precipitate a barytic salt equi
atomically as respects the bases, and therefore that the pro
posed plan of indirect estimation of ammonia was an accurate
one, I subjected 54 grs. of nuuriate of ammonia to distillation
with an excess of a solution of the ordinary carbonate of soda,
carrying on the distillation until about one-half of the liquid
had passed into the receiver, in which distilled water was of
course placed; long before this quantity of liquid was distilled
a slip of turmeric paper suspended from the tubulure of the
retort ceased to be reddened; the contents of the receiver, a
solution of a basic carbonate of ammonia, were added to a so
lution of nitrate of barytes, and then subjected to a stream of
carbonic acid gas until the precipitate became arenaceous and
 the solution slightly affected litmus paper; this exposed to the
 airfor a day, and the precipitate collected, and dried, gave 97.63
 grs. of carbonate of barytes.      As in the former case, the    fil
 tered solution when   gently  heated gave off a little carbonic acid
 gas, but  deposited  nothing.  These results being so favourable,
 and the process simple, the trifling deficiency evidently being
 traceable to defective manipulation alone,      I have adopted this
 process for estimating ammonia in the analyses subsequently
 detailed, considering it susceptible of greater accuracy than
 the hydrochloric acid method, and as accurate as, and far less
 troublesome and expensive than, the employment of salts of
  platinum, and of alcohol for this purpose.
     The process for separating the phosphate of lime from the
 phosphate of magnesia depends upon the insolubility of the
 oxalate of lime in very dilute acetic acid, and the solubility of
 the magnesian salt in that menstruum.          Thus, when a solu
 tion of these mixed phosphates in hydrochloric acid is treated
 with ammonia slightly in excess to precipitate the charac
 teristic gelatinous precipitate, and acetic acid is gradually
 added till such precipitate is redissolved, the solution being
  acid to litmus paper, but only faintly so to the taste, oxalate
  of ammonia produces the characteristic precipitate of oxalate
  of lime, which base is completely thrown down; the filtered
  solution, when evaporated and treated with a little phosphate
  of soda and ammonia, affording the ammoniacal magnesian
  phosphate, which contains no lime.         I do not give this pro
  cess as one which is    necessarily   rigidly  accurate, for if the

126          Mr. Denham Smith      on the Composition  of
acetic acid be in too great excess, more than completely suf
ficient to redissolve the precipitate produced by ammonia,
the clear solution, although containing no magnesia, will at
times, as   I have found, give indications of the existence of
lime on   supersaturation  with ammonia; but the quantity under
such circumstances held in solution is too small to be of im
portance except in cases where a scientific point is involved.
 Where oxalate of lime is in solution together with the mag
nesian and calcareous phosphates, this process requires some
modification, which it may be better to explain in the details
               I
of the mode have adopted in the analysis of guano, than at
present—that recapitulation may be as much as is possible
 avoided.
    It may be advantageous here to describe the mode of ana
lysis pursued in the examination of these samples of guano,
as each analysis, in fact, consists of three separate ones, viz.
of those portions soluble in cold water; the substances which
 dissolved on boiling the residue insoluble in cold water, in
 abundance of water; and the portion which remained inso
                                               I
luble in either menstruum. This division found to be a very
 convenient one, as the solutions obtained were far less com
 F.    than if the portions of the guano soluble in water cold and
   ot, and in acids, had been mixed together; and it of course
 gives a pretty correct idea of the salts as they actually are
 presented to the roots of plants manured with guano.           My
 reasons for combining the bases and acids as       I have done in
 the results of these analyses are, that in some cases the propor
 tional quantities of  .and      base have tallied, and also that I
 have obtained by crystallizing the hot and cold solutions,
 oxalate of ammonia, oxalate of soda, muriate of ammonia,
chlorides of potassium and of sodium, sulphates of soda and
potash, urate of ammonia and free uric acid, from the various
samples of guano; and also that by microscopic examination
crystals of the chlorides and of sulphate of soda have been
readily observed in the mass of the guano.          As I  have also
 given the amount of bases and acids obtained without re
 ference to the state of combination in which they exist, those
 who differ from me in this respect, can combine them as they
 think proper.
     The mode adopted for determining the respective amounts
 of the fixed alkaline bases is open to many objections. It is
  complex; a very slight error in weighing is liable to consi
  derably vitiate the result: if the whole numbers          I  have
  adopted as representing the combining equivalents of the va
  rious acids and bases are incorrect, so also must the results
  be.   On the other hand,     I have tried this method upon an

                  some     varieties    of South American Guano.                            127
 actual mixture of soda and potash salts, and the results ap
 proximated very closely to the truth; and upon the whole,
 weighing the advantages of this indirect system of Griffin's
 with the positive modes of estimating the potash, either by
 perchloric acid, tartaric acid or platina salt, I believe this
 indirect mode to afford, in careful hands, at least as accurate
 returns, if not more so, than the direct modes of estimating
 the potash, and ascertaining the soda from the loss.             may be          I
 wrong in attributing this process to Mr. Griffin, as Barreswil
 and Sobrero assign it to M. Mayer, with a date anterior to
 Griffin's description in the Philosophical Magazine.
    With respect to the neutral phosphate of lime stated to
 exist in the sample of “Concrete Guano, No. 6,” and also in
            I
 No. 2, may state that it precipitated as neutral phosphate;
 and if I had estimated it as bone-phosphate, the sum of the
 analysis would have fallen very far short of the quantity em
                                                   I
 ployed; whilst by estimating it as have done, the loss was most
 trivial, amounting only to a common error of analysis. Of the
 solubility of the phosphate of lime, and of the ammoniacal
 magnesian phosphate in boiling water, it is simply necessary
 to refer to the already established solubility of these salts in
 neutral solutions containing organic animal matter, and also
 to state that these solutions were invariably faintly acid to
litmus paper.
   I  was led to suspect the existence of a volatile acid in guano,
 but   Iin vain tried to isolate             it,

acid and filtered;   in no one instance did any evolution of car
bonic acid take place; the solution was then treated with am
monia in excess, which precipitated the oxalate and subphos
phate of lime, perhaps the magnesia also; acetic acid was then
rapidly added until it was distinctly acid to litmus paper, and a
slight acidity could be detected by the taste; the insoluble pre
cipitate being collected, thoroughly washed, dried, and ignited
with the usual precaution, indicated the amount of the oxalate
of lime; this precipitate was invariably examined for phos
phate of lime; if it contained any, this was separated in the
state of bone-phosphate and estimated as neutral phosphate,
in which state of combination it existed mixed with the oxa
late of lime.
    To the acetic acid solution excess of oxalate of ammonia
was added, this precipitated the lime present in the solution ori
ginally as bone-phosphate, sometimes mixed with neutral phos
phate of lime, and from the weight of the resulting carbonate
of lime, and the loss of weight sustained by ignition of another
portion, correcting each other, the amount of the phosphate
of lime was calculated. The filtered solution evaporated until
a slight pellicle began to form, was treated with ammonia in
excess, and a little phosphate of soda, observing the usual pre
cautions recommended by Berzelius, and the resulting ammo
 niacal phosphate of magnesia was collected and weighed.        The
 portion insoluble in hydrochloric acid being treated with potash
 gave a solution possessing the properties described to belong
 to an alkaline solution of the substance termed humus or
 humic acid; this was precipitated, collected and weighed; the
 residue insoluble in potash was weighed and ignited, the loss of
 weight noted, and the product treated with hydrochloric acid;
 if effervescence ensued on this addition from the presence of
 carbonate of lime, this was estimated as oxalate, and was added
 to the amount already obtained of that salt; by these means
 the proportion of the organic matter insoluble in potash, the
 humus, oxalate of lime       (if
                               any), sand, &c. &c. undissolved         by
 hydrochloric acid, were obtained.

  134                  Mr.      Denham Smith on the Composition                                              of
  of the acideven when acting on 3 to 500 grs. This guano also
  contained 17 per cent. of sand, &c., consisting apparently of
  sea-sand mixed with little lumps of granite, and a very dense
 black sand, resembling Iserine or Menachanite.
    The first lump of the “Concrete Guano,” No. 5, was about
 the size of a human skull, soft enough to be readily shred with
 a knife, and uniform throughout, presenting the appearance
 of a dark brown mass containing a vast number of minute
 dirty white granulations.    Its scent was very slight, and
 neither this nor any of the other samples had an ammoniacal
 odour, but merely the peculiar smell possessed by South
 American guano. When shred and thoroughly mixed the
 powder was damp, and almost as dark-coloured as Nos. 3
 and 4; very different in this respect from the samples 1 and 2,
 the analyses of which have already been detailed; 500 grs.
 was the quantity analysed.

136       Mr. Denham Smith         on the Composition   of
   On comparing the results of these five analyses, the extreme
variableness of the composition of guano is the first thing that
demands attention; no two samples resemble each other: in
one, potash salts, abundance of urate of ammonia, with free
uric acid exist; in another, the salts of the mixed alkalies are
present, but the soda salts in far larger proportion than those
of potash, and the amount of urate of ammonia diminished
from about 17 to 2 per cent. ; here also free uric acid is absent;
in another instance of ordinary guano, No. 4, no uric acid
whatever is present, and this specimen contains a large pro
portion of sand. The amount of ammonia also varies very
considerably in this description of guano, and even the pro
portion of those salts which are common to both seldom
bear any relation to each other. The state of combination in
which the phosphate of lime occurs is also dissimilar; that of
sample No. 1 apparently existing wholly as bone-phosphate,
whilst that of No. 2 is a mixture of the neutral with the sub
sesquiphosphate of lime: instances of dissimilarity may readily
be multiplied by a glance at the results of these two analyses,
the resemblance to each other being for the most part con
fined to the existence of some similar salts in both cases.
   Then, again, the samples of concrete guano differ not
 merely from the common guano, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, but also
widely from each other; sample No. 5, concrete guano, con
taining large proportions of sulphate of soda and oxalate of
lime, no uric acid, and but a very small quantity, when com
pared to any of the other samples, of phosphate of lime—this
existing in this specimen as bone-phosphate; whilst the other
kind of concrete guano, No. 6, affords very small quantities of
soluble substances, the merest trace of ammonia salts, and con
sists almost entirely of water and phosphate of lime.         The
constitution of this salt again varies from that which exists in
the specimen No. 5, being chiefly neutral phosphate instead
of the bone-phosphate. The saline guano is the very opposite
of this last description; the larger proportion consisting of
soda salts and others soluble in water: here also the ammo
niacal salts are almost absent, whilst common salt, a substance
existing in comparatively small quantities in the other sam
ples, and totally absent in two of them, is by far      most pre
                                                        its
valent constituent.
   Can  we  then wonder that such widely differing results should
have been obtained    byvarious farmers and experimentalists who
have used the substance termed guano; even when            applica
                                                          its

respects quality of land, description  ofcrop, time    application,

138        Mr. Denham Smith          on the Composition   of
to whether it ought not to be considered as a product arising
                                               º
from the decomposition of a portion of urate of ammonia by
the presence of a stronger acid, rather than as existing in the
specimen of guano in an uncombined state. This I cannot
consider to have been the case; for although, like the other
solutions made by boiling water, it was faintly acid, yet in
No. 2 no free uric acid was discovered,                   the urate of
ammonia in that    specimen    existed under   precisely the same cir
cumstances as in the analysis of the first sample; and if uric
acid had been evolved in the first instance from its combina
tion with ammonia, this salt surely ought not to have escaped
decomposition in the second case.          I am therefore induced to
consider it as   highly probable     that, when the dung of which
guano is composed is freshly deposited, the uric acid which it
contains is not wholly in a state of combination with ammonia,
 but that a portion exists as free uric acid.
    I must now allude to the production of the oxalate of am
 monia which is so constantly found in guano, being compelled
 on this point to differ with Dr. Fownes.
    I am no friend to the hypothetical deductions which are
 now so constantly employed in organic chemistry. They may
 have their uses in leading the experimenter to the selection of
 the right path and the proper mode of investigating organized
 substances; but the abuses they are apt to engender, too often,
I  fear, more than counterbalance their advantages. Instances
 of the elevation of hypothesis to the rank and consideration
 due to ascertained and undoubted facts, and the erection of
 other theories upon the first hypothesis, are to be found thickly
 strewn throughout nearly every chemical publication of the
 present day; nor are the works of some of the most distin
 guished chemists free from this objection, but rather might
 be referred to as furnishing the most flagrant instances of
 this indulgence of a luxuriant imagination.           In accordance
 with this usage, the sole requisite conditions to produce any
 given organic compound which may be known or imagined
 to exist, is to commence with a something which need contain
 but two elements, carbon and azote, and these are almost su
 perfluous; add to this substance the oxygen of the atmosphere
 and water, as much as may be sufficient, liberate hydrogen,
 ammonia, oxygen, carbonic acid or azote, as may be neces
 sary, and there is the substance sought for—on paper.
    To return, however, to the formation of the oxalate of am
 monia: it must,   I  presume, be formed from the urate of am
 monia, because guano does not contain any other substance,
  except by such a process as is detailed above, which can pro
  duce it; in this, I believe, all   chemists are agreed.

    Now Dr. Fownes supposes that the uric acid of the urate of
 ammonia combines with eight equivalents of water and two of
 oxygen from the air, and produces four equivalents of oxalate
 of ammonia and two of carbonic acid, which of course unites,
 although it is not so stated in the note I refer toº, with the
 equivalent of ammonia before combined with the uric acid,
 producing the bicarbonate of ammonia, not the most volatile
 nor soluble of                its
                        salts, and which,         formed, surely ought if                                             to

  turnal dews, has been finally washed away by the sea-water.
  This is rather an unsatisfactory mode of accounting for the
 absence of the muriate of ammonia, which from what we know
 of guano, and the existence of oxalate of soda in the saline
 guano, we may fairly conclude must have been formed, but
 which in the sample I have examined contains but little more
 than one equivalent of muriate of ammonia to three of oxalate
 of soda, so that nearly two equivalents have disappeared.
    As to the respective hypotheses of the coprolitic or recent
 nature of these deposits,                   I
                                 have never held but one opinion,
 the one I believe generally entertained, that this manure is
 deposited by sea-fowl inhabiting coasts where no rain falls,
 and which consequently is never washed away.               This view is
 supported by          all
                      ancient and most modern authorities, and
has recently received additional confirmation from Mr. Tesche
 macher     ofBoston, who has presented specimens               Peruvian           of
guano       the Philosophical Society
           to                                   that town, containing

feathers; and after quoting the accounts given              the old Por       by

perhaps be as well to notice that the investigations there con

very beautiful theory; a more correct title for them would
have been, a Generalization of the Analysis which occurs in
ordinary Analytical Geometry.
   I will, with your permission, take this opportunity of com

   It seems as if some supposition of this kind would remove a
difficulty started by Jacobi (Crelle, t. ix.) with respect to the
multiple periodicity of these functions.     Of course this must
remain a mere suggestion until the theory of quaternions is
very much more developed than it is at present; in particular
the theory of quaternion exponentials would have to be deve
loped, for even in a product, such as (18.), there is a certain
singular exponential factor running through the theory, as
appears from some formulae in Jacobi's Fund. Nova (relative

with the difference of velocity of M and N, when our object
is to calculate the extensions and compressions due to the
motion of the mass.     For the greater distinctness, let us con
ceive the mass to be at first in a state in which it is neither
extended nor compressed. In a given time, considering M at
rest, let N n be the space due to the difference of motion of
M and N, or to the relative velocity of N. The physical line
whose unextended length was M N will now be ertended into
 Mn; and in like manner, if N' be to the left of L (M L being
perpendicular to     q' and r's), M N' will be compressed into
                       P
Mn', where N'n' = N n. This shows distinctly the manner
in which the motion in question must necessarily produce ex
tension and compression in the mass in different directions.
     Ifthe space N n due to the relative motion of N become
sufficiently great, the physical line M N will be so extended
as to break, and an open fissure will be the consequence.
Our first object, however, will be to find those directions in
which the extension and compression have their maximum
values, before the extension has become so great as to cause
the fracture of the mass. And here it is important to remark,
that so long as we keep within this limit, we have no concern
whatever with the cohesive force of the mass, or the law ac
cording to which it may vary in passing from one point to an
other.    That consideration will only enter when we proceed
to the ulterior part of our investigation, where the object will
be to determine the directions in which the mass will be frac
tured, when the internal tensions, shall become greater than
                                     *
those which its cohesive force is able to resist.             -

represented by the ratio                        the point   m   being so taken that
Mm    shall = MN. This ratio will manifestly be different for
different lines, such as MN; our first object is to find the
position of M N for which the ratio will be a maximum, subject
to the condition that N n shall be the same for        positions            all               of
N.    The problem,       thus presented

Consequently the extension is a maximum when 4–45°; also
it is a minimum when 0 = 135°, or the compression is a mari
mum for this latter value of 0.
    6. To pass generally from the extension and compression
to the corresponding values of the tension and pressure, it is
necessary to know the laws which connect them; but here we
are not concerned with this more general question, our object
being merely to deduce the directions of maximum tension
and pressure from those of maximum extension and compres
sion.    Now, whatever may be the general law connecting ten
sion and extension, there can be no doubt that when the one
is a maximum or minimum the other must be so likewise.
Hence the directions above determined will be those of max
imum tension and pressure, so far as the tension and pressure
are superinduced by the motion of the glacier. Consequently
if M N and M N' be those directions for the point M, each will
º
be inclined at an angle of 45° to the direction of motion, and
       will be at right angles to each other.
      he preceding method has the advantage of pointing out
very simply and distinctly the manner in which the difference
of velocity in different parts of the glacier produces tension
and pressure, and the results above given are arrived at with
great facility.    ButI   shall now proceed to a more complete
investigation of the problem, still preserving the same limita
tion as before in the hypothesis of the equality of the veloci
ties of the upper and lower surfaces of the glacier.      Our re
sults will thus be rendered     independent   of the depth of the
glacier, which may, therefore, be treated as a simple lamina.
We shall thus only be concerned with space     - of two dimen
sions.
   7. Internal Tensions and Pressures of a Glacier.—When a
plain solid lamina, having a certain degree of compressibility
and extensibility, is brought into a position of constraint by
forces acting in the plane of the lanina, the particles on one
side of a geometrical line will exert certain forces on the con
tiguous particles on the opposite side of the line. If the lamina
were formed of fluid particles the resultant action at each point
of this line of separation would be normal to it; but when the
lamina is solid this will not be generally the case, and there
fore the force at any point of the line may be resolved into two
forces, one being normal and the other tangential to the line
of separation;  all forces being supposed   toact in the plane  of
the lamina.     Suppose the line  of separation  to    be

    R is therefore a function of the two independent variables 0
    and 4 ; and I shall now proceed to find the values of 0 and 4,
    which render R a maximum or a minimum.           Differentiating
    with  respect to 4, we have
                         0=      sin 4         X

    which shows that for any assigned value of 0, or position of the
    line of separation, the maximum value of R will be that of the
    resultant of X and Y, and the corresponding value of 4, that
    of the angle which the direction of that resultant makes with
    the axis of w.   Differentiating with respect to 0, we have
                            dX           d    .                         Y

tension of the mass will be relieved in the direction of maxi

 the ice were perfect, a physical line in that direction would

    in the case before us, the extension would increase forty times
    faster between                   the first and second stations than for a                                             con
    siderable space near the centre                                   of the glacier; and if the                             ex
    treme flanks were taken, the ratio would probably be still
    considerably greater.        Thus, if the glacier at the present
    time were perfectly continuous, the flanks would probably be
    dislocated by transverse fissures in a few months, while the
    continuity of the central portion, independently of the action
    of local causes, might be preserved for many years, even if it
    should break with an extension no greater than that required
    to fracture the flanks.                          If
                                    also it be allowed that the extensi
    bility becomes greater as the extension is produced more
    slowly, the glacier might move on for a still greater number
    of years without central dislocations due to the more rapid
    progression of        centre.    its

conclusions have, in fact, been drawn from the conditions of
equilibrium of an element of the mass, conditions, the analytical
expression of which is only equivalent to the differential equa
tions of the problem.    The quantities involved in the prece
ding results are        X,
                      Y, and                       f.
                                  The directions in which the
couples depending on fact is determined by the observed fact
of the central being greater than the lateral motion; the facts
of the forces X, and Y, being pressures or tensions are                                                           in

from the form and inclination of the glacial valley. And these
are the points on which our conclusions depend; they are in
a great degree independent of the actual values of the above
forces.   It would seem impossible to draw any accurate con
clusions depending   on less ambiguous circumstances. It may,
however, be remarked that the whole investigation is tacitly
based on the assumption of the continuity of the mass being
preserved in the same sense as in the ordinary investigations of
the motion of fluids. In the case before us the assumption has
beer, that, while a continuous mass having elasticity changes

tions which have occurred to me since the Report was written,
and also some practical results which were brought generally
before our members here at the last Friday Evening Meeting.
I  need hardly say that the Report proposes to draw away the
lower acrial contents of the goaf by an iron pipe laid down
in one or other of the ways of the mine, and either entering
into the return way, or having a fanner or bellows or other
blowing apparatus upon                 The points                     speak

        DEAR SIR,
 I      SHALL  be obliged by your allowing me to make a remark
      or two in your pages on the subject of glaciers; which
subject has been recently discussed both there and elsewhere.
In the course of these discussions, expressions have been                                                    let
fall,   as there were some particular care requisite
           if                                             avoid                                    to
 confusion with regard             notions generally considered very ele
                                         to
 mentary,         rigidity, solidity, flexibility, fluidity.
                    as                                                will there            I

 readers, begin with distinguishing these.                   Iligid bodies are
 absolutely incapable                  of
                                  any motion         their parts among each
                                                                    of
other.       To these are       opposed     flewible bodies,          which the             in
 parts move without changing their attachments; and fluid
 bodies,        which the parts have no attachment
               in                                                    each other,            to
 and move amongst each other freely. Flexible bodies are elastic,
 when they tend          resume their shape.

state of tension, produced by this distortion; but the distortion
will be limited, and the downward projection of the curved
lines also limited, by the flexure which is possible for the tex
ture. If in any part the texture gives way, we shall have fissures
nearly perpendicular to the transverse curves. On this sup
position of a flexible glacier, we have (1) original transverse
straight lines drawn into curves of limited flerure; (2) the sub
 stance in a state of distortion, from which hand specimens would
instantly recover; (3) a homogeneous texture of such speci
 In ens.
    Now let this mass of caoutchouc become viscous or plastic.
 What will now be the condition of the mass 2 The sides and
 bottom will still be held back by the friction; the middle and
upper part will slide forwards, but not freely. This want of
freedom in the motion (arising from the viscosity) will produce
a drag towards the middle of the valley, where the motion is
freest; hence the direction in which filaments slide past each
 other will be obliquely directed towards the middle.                 The
 sliding will separate the mass according to such lines; and
 though new attachments will take place, the mass may be
 expected to retain the results of this separation in the traces
of parallel fissures in this direction.           If the texture of the
 substance yield to the tension which tends to separate it
directly, we shall have fissures in directions perpendicular to
the directions just described, and therefore convex upwards.
 Original transverse straight lines will become curves, project
ing downwards; and the projection will increase without limit
as the sliding goes on.         Hence, on this supposition of a vis
cous or     plastic glacier,  we should have (1) original transverse
straight lines drawn into curves of unlimited flexure; (2) the
texture of the substance in a state of equilibrium, so that hand
specimens have no distortion to recover from ; (3) a banded tex
ture, the bands being traces of parallel fissures.
    It is well known that the latter set of phaenomena agree with
the actual phaenomena of glaciers, and the former set differ
from them. To some persons it may seem harsh to call the
mass of a glacier plastic or viscous, when it seems so solid.
It may be said that we can hardly call a mass viscous, when
we have in it cliffs perhaps a hundred feet high.               But    let
                                                                         it

of the Comet Medal, offered by His Majesty Christian VIII., king of
Denmark, having become vacant, His Majesty had been pleased to

he read to the Meeting the conditions under which the medal would
be granted, from the Monthly Notice, vol. iii. p. 132*.
   For the convenience of Fellows and others who may not have the
volume of the Monthly Notices at hand, the regulations are here re

of the death of Mr. Baily and Dr. Olbers of Bremen :--

  quire its use at all, as the proof of the existence of the needle is our
  only aim. I have used the horse-shoe magnet, but should prefer, in
  most cases, an electro-magnet like this, made for me by Messrs.
  Horne of Newgate Street, which is made of a simple straight bar of
  soft iron, wound round with wire.              Your chemical lecturer has,
  doubtlessly, made you aware that the magnetic effect is proportionate
  to the power of the battery, so that if you were desirous of produ
  cing but slight effect, you would employ this tumbler battery; but if
  you required the action to be manifested at a greater distance, you
  would use a compound battery, such as this trough battery upon the
  table. The compound battery will magnetize a needle, in conjunc
 tion with the electro-magnet, in the space of two or three minutes.
 A powerful permanent magnet would answer as well as the tempo
 rary magnet; but it would be very expensive, and not so constantly
 at hand.     When soft iron is impacted in any part of the body, we
 do not require either the electro- or permanent magnet, for on this
 substance we are unable to confer magnetic properties.
     “To test the existence of a magnet within the body, we may take
 a magnetized sewing needle, and suspend it by a piece of silkworm's
 silk, when it will exhibit certain phaenomena upon the approach of
 the suspected part, provided it contain a piece of magnetized steel.
 Although this simple contrivance will amply suffice, I myself pos
 sess a needle which was made for me by Messrs. Willats of Cheap
 side, and which is well-adapted for the purpose.
     “It consists, as you perceive, of a delicate needle, about six inches
 long, centred upon a small agate cup, resting upon a steel point;
 so that the smallest possible amount of resistance is offered to its free
 play.
     “When a part containing magnetic steel is brought near the
needle, it may be either attracted or repelled, it may move upwards
or downwards, or it may exhibit disquietude according to the posi
tion in which the new magnet is held. We may detect the position
of the foreign body, when it is of any size, by ascertaining where                      its
north and south poles lie, and these are determined                 by
                                                                 their repelling

netism, but not the direction          the magnet.

ON   Two NEw METALS, PELOPIUM AND NIOBIUM, Discover ED
       IN THE BAWARIAN TANTALITES.           BY PROF. H. ROSE.
  I have   discovered in the tantalite of Bavaria two new metals, in
the present memoir however I shall only treat of one: the oxide
of the second metal, to which I have for the present assigned the
name of oxide of pelopium, greatly resembles tantalic acid, although
I am fully persuaded that it is distinct. I shall however institute
a series of experiments to determine their precise difference.
   For more than four years I have been engaged in investigating
the tantalites from various localities, and the tantalic acids derived
from them.       An observation of my brother engaged me to under
take these researches.      He found that the tantalites of Bodenmais
in Bavaria, and those of North America, have the same crystalline
form as Wolfram. I had also noticed that the tantalites from the
same or from different localities, having the same form of crystal
and the same chemical composition, differed from each other by
their specific gravity.
    The analysis of these different tantalites was executed according
to Berzelius's method, by fusing the mineral reduced to a very fine
powder with bisulphate of potash in a platinum crucible.
    To obtain an accurate idea of the composition of the tantalites of
Bavaria and of North America, it was requisite to subunit the tan
talic acid obtained from them to a very strict examination.              On
comparing the amount of oxygen of the tantalic acid, derived from
 these localities, with the amount of oxygen of the bases, protoxide
of iron and protoxide of manganese, the relation existing between
them is found to be not simple.       This relation         is,   on
                                                            the other hand,

resembles the tantalic acid procured from the Finland tantalites, and

fore and after calcination. When tantalic acid is heated, it acquires
a faint yellow colour; niobic acid, on the contrary, a deep yellow ;
both became colourless on cooling. Tantalic acid forms on cooling
a white dull powder; niobic acid, fragments possessed of great
lustre, similar to that presented by titanic acid precipitated by am
monia and calcined;       with this difference,—that the titanic acid
exhibits a brownish tint, while the niobic acid remains colourless.
   Tantalic and niobic acids readily combine with the alkalies.
When fused with carbonated alkalies, they expel the carbonic acid.
These combinations are soluble in water, and also in an excess of a
solution of caustic or carbonated potash, but with difficulty in an
excess of caustic or carbonate of soda.     The niobate of soda indeed
is almost insoluble in an excess of a solution of soda.                   Acids preci
pitate the tantalic and niobic acids from these solutions.                    Sulphuric
acid precipitates both completely on the application of heat; but in
the cold the tantalic acid is only partially thrown down by                        while                         it,

chloride of niobium prepared in the same manner is colourless, non
fusible, and but very slightly volatile.
   When dry ammonia is passed over perchloride of tantalum, the
gas is absorbed, but very slowly, and the perchloride becomes less
heated than is the case with the other liquid and volatile metallic
chlorides placed under the same circumstances.              This is not owing
to the perchloride not possessing great affinity for the ammonia;
but the new combination formed envelopes the perchloride of tan
talum, and prevents the reaction from extending further.                If this
new compound be heated, metallic tantalum is obtained, and hy
 drochlorate of ammonia disengaged.           The whole of the hydrochlo
rate of ammonia is removed by washing with water. On heating
the metal with access of air, it is converted into tantalic acid with
evolution of light.       The reduction of tantalum requires a much
higher temperature than that of titanium under similar circum
stances.   Metallic tantalum presents the appearance of black crusts.
Water has no action on it.
    Perchloride of niobium submitted to the action of dry ammonia
becomes yellow, with considerable evolution of heat, because from

it   be more strongly heated, incandescence then begins, and the                                                   oxide
becomes           green.         If
                      however the oxide which has become black
be heated in a small retort, it will be observed that a great disengage
ment of gas occurs both before and during ignition; this gas is oxy
gen, and the oxide becomes at the same time green.
   Hydrated oxide of chromium is completely converted by heat in
contact with air into peroxide, Cº, which at a low red heat is changed,
with incandescence, into oxide of chromium.         M. Krüger finds the
peroxide to consist of 63.7 metal and 36.3 oxygen.
   This peroxide is a peculiar compound, and does not contain
chromic acid ; if it be mixed with chloride of sodium and the mixture
be treated with sulphuric acid, chlorine is given out without the for
mation of any trace of the red chromate of chloride of chromium.
When it is boiled with hydrochloric acid, the peroxide yields chlorine,
and if heated with sulphuric acid it gives oxygen; the best method
of making these experiments is to precipitate hydrate of oxide of
chromium from dilute solutions by ammonia.         If the precipitation be
effected in a boiling solution, it is obtained in a more compact state,
which renders it but slightly soluble in diluted acids.
   If to a solution of bichromate of potash there be added a neutral
solution of sulphate of chromium and then ammonia, there is obtained
a brown precipitate, from which, as shown by M. Mons,        the sul                                        all

XX.        Is Capillary Attraction                an Electric Phaenomenon?              A
  Memoir by JoHN WILLIAM DRAPER, M.D., Professor of
  Chemistry in the University of New York+.
WRiº                on the mechanical theory of capillary attrac
          tion have contented themselves with the statement,
that the phaenomena exhibited by tubes of small diameter are
due to two causes,—the action of the tube upon the liquid,
and of the liquid upon itself.
   In our philosophical treatises capillary attraction is spoken
of as a force sui generis. It occupies an isolated position.
   But it appears to me, that without disturbing in any way
the characters which have been assumed for it as a specific
force, or the mathematical conditions under which it acts, there
is a point of view from which it may be regarded, which at
once brings it into an exceedingly interesting position.
                               I
   In this memoir propose to show,-
   I. That the principal phaenomena ascribed to capillary at
traction may be explained by regarding them as manifestations
of electrical action.

tightly together, they will adhere; and                     as
                                            the adhesion continues
in vacuo, the phaenomenon        explained is                    byby

known laws of electricity they must therefore attract one an
other.
   Is it philosophical to assume the existence of a new force
when there is one so palpably efficient at hand?
   (2.) If a plate of glass, hanging from one of the arms of a
balance, is lowered on the surface of some mercury in an
earthen cup, adhesion takes place; and it requires a consider
able weight to be added on the other arm before the glass can
be separated from the mercury.             This is a phaenomenon of
capillary attraction.
   But on trying, as before, with an electroscope, the glass is
found positive; and though the mercury is unelectrified, we
see obviously that                      its
                             electricity has escaped into the earth.
And that this         true  may
                              is      shown       putting the mercury
                                                       be                    by
into   aglass  cup,      otherwise orinsulating        then the glass               it;                    is
positive and the mercury negative; they therefore ought                 at                            to
tract each other.
   (3.) Two lead bullets pressed together adhere,                presume                        I
for the same reason that two        pieces     glass   adhere. On put  of
ting them apart                    no

to their conducting power                          *.

they ought therefore          attract.   to
I    might add other instances. These probably are sufficient
to communicate the idea            question.      in
      In   all
           these cases the conducting power             the surfaces em               of

overcome the cohesion of the particles of water, but not ef
fected the separation of the glass. The surface of water which
has been torn away, and that which remains in the cup, are
both equally good conductors; and hence a discharge from
one to the other takes place, in the same manner as in the act
of separating iron and mercury.
   That the capillary attraction of glass for water is nothing
more than an electrical phaenomenon, appears when we so ar
range things as to be able to separate the touching surfaces
completely. In a conical vessel let some water be frozen, and
when perfect solidification has taken place, and no water is
present, pull the cone of ice out of the glass: examined at the
electroscope the glass and ice are found to be in opposite con
ditions.  Now is it not reasonable to suppose that the physi
cal cause of the adhesion of ice to glass is the same as that of
water to glass? Does not therefore this experiment prove
that the capillary attraction of glass and water is only an elec
tric phaenomenon
     II. If   capillary attraction is nothing more than the result
of an electrical disturbance which ensues when bodies are
brought in contact with one another, we might expect that any
process which can change the electro-chemical relations of
such substances, could also probably alter their capillary phae
In Omena.
   The following experiments may be cited as substantiating
this view:—1st. In a watch
glass place a quantity of pure
mercury, A B, and upon it a
drop of water, C. Bring the
water in contact with the posi
tive platina electrode of a vol
taic battery of twenty or thirty pairs, and touch the mercury
with the negative.       The moment the contact is made the
drop of water loses              its
                           spherical form, and spreads out into                     a
thin circular  disc,  wetting   the surface      the mercury. of The
diameter      of
              the disc seems           greater
                                           to   be proportion      the
                                                                   in          as
battery   ismore powerful.
   Under ordinary circumstances water does not wet quick
silver;    drop        of                        of on    quicksilver
         a            water remains       the surface                   onof

                                             remains     water. As
soon, however,         as

by  the aid    of voltaic battery, the phaenomenon

same period    of growth.      It was a thick-set red wheat, sown
in December on a       light  and good turnip soil, to which an un
usually large quantity of guano (4 cwt. per acre) had been
applied as a manure. About one-tenth of the whole quantity
was diseased, while several other kinds of wheat, sown in the
same field, but to which no guano had been applied, were
perfectly sound.
    The ears had a much greener appearance than the same
 kind of wheat in a healthy condition, and emitted a very dis
 agreeable smell, which is not easily described.
    On close examination the grains were found filled with a
 black unctuous powder in place of the milky pulp of the
 healthy seed. This powder was separated in quantity by
 bruising the ears in a mortar and si<U+017F>ting through fine muslin,
 and submitted to chemical examination.            It had the same dis
 agreeable smell as the ears, but stronger; it was oily to the
 touch, and heavier than alcohol and water. When heated in the
 air it burned with a bright flame, leaving a residue of charcoal,
 and eventually a trace of white ash.        Vº.      heated in a tube,
 it gave off water, empyreumatic and oily matters, and a little
 ammonia. It was insoluble in a solution of potash and in
 hydrochloric acid; nitric acid made it yellow, and hot sul
 phuric acid dissolved it with purplish-red colour.           Boiled with
 water, it yielded merely a little gum and bitter brown extractive
 matter, the greater part remaining undissolved. Alcohol ex
 tracted a fat oil, and a waxy or resinous matter; the undis
 solved portion appeared to consist of lignin mixed with char
 coal. The black powder greedily absorbed oxygen from the
 air when in a moistened condition, giving rise to carbonic acid.
     A carefully conducted proximate analysis of the substance
 led to the following results:—
            Wax or resin with fixed oil . . . 7-0
            Gum and extractive matter, &c.             .   7-8

     The ash consisted chiefly     of earthy phosphates and silicate
 of potash.

the greatest heat. The mixture of coal-gas and air burnt in
this lamp, is made by injecting a sufficient quantity of air into
the pipe which supplies the coal-gas.            To the end of a com
mon gas-cock connected with the street main, a piece of cop
per pipe about four inches long is attached, having a diameter
of about a quarter of an inch; outside this is another piece
of copper tube, of considerably larger diameter, and six
inches longer than the internal tube.                The air which is to
mix with the coal-gas is admitted into this longer external
tube, the quantity being regulated by cocks. The object of
this is to effect the mixture of the air and coal-gas under the
most favourable circumstances; if mixed otherwise than as
two currents flowing in the same direction, a diminution of
pressure is caused; whilst by causing them to mix in the man
ner just described, the pressure of the whole current is rather
augmented.
    The pressure of the ordinary street gas does not, I believe,
generally exceed two inches; if the air was introduced by a
pipe entering the gas-pipe at right angles, and if the pressure
of the air at                all
                     exceeded that        the gas,       was very apt

stop the current                   of
                        gas altogether, the air forcing the gas back
into the pipe; by using the above double pipe this was ob
viated, and was found possible slightly

this causes the heated air to pass round the upper edges and
over the lid of the crucible, so as to bring the whole to the

same temperature.
   With this arrangement it is easy to keep a platinum cruci
ble two inches high and an inch and a half across at a bright
red or yellow heat for any required time; the heat is perfectly
manageable, the gas may be turned off at any moment, and
as quickly lighted; hence any operation is far more under
control than in a furnace. The heat obtained with a cru
cible of the size just mentioned is rather above the melting
point of silver, for a piece of that metal is easily fused in a
porcelain crucible placed in the interior of the platinum one.
It is of course equal to the fusion of mixtures of silicates with
carbonate of soda, three or four hundred grains of a mixture
of carbonate of soda and a siliceous compound being perfectly
fused in about eight minutes, whilst from the entire command

     XXIII.     Notice   of a new Hydrated Phosphate of Lime.
                      By John PERcy, M.D.”
Totity of distilled water, add
         a solution of common phosphate of soda, in a large quan
                                       a solution of chloride of calcium
till precipitation ceases.        Immediately pass through the mix
ture, containing the phosphate of lime suspended, a current
of carbonic acid gas, and continue this for about an hour;
 then filter immediately, and set aside the filtered liquor in a
jar, the mouth of which is covered loosely with paper to keep
out dust. In the course of a day or two, and sometimes in a
 much shorter time, crystals will appear on the surface, and
 will, when stirred with a rod, sink. After the lapse of several
 days a very sensible quantity of crystals may be collected.
 Transfer them to a filter, and wash with cold or tepid distilled
 water, and dry in a warm place.
     It occurs in the form of brilliant white scales, which, on
 examination with the microscope, are seen to consist of modi
 fied rhomboidal plates more or less broken and confused.
     The salt melts with difficulty at an intense heat by the
 blowpipe on platinum foil.            Heated to bright redness in a
 platinum crucible, 3.21 grs. of salt lost 0.85, and in a second
 experiment 3:16 grs. lost 0-84 gr. I found that every trace
 of water was given off after exposure for 10 minutes or a
 quarter of an hour to a bright red heat.
     Rose's plan was followed in determining the lime and phos
 phoric acid, which consists in dissolving in hydrochloric acid,
 then adding sulphuric acid, then alcohol, which precipitates
 the lime completely as sulphate.
        I. 3.21 grs. of salt gave 2:51 of sulphate of lime.

     The oxygen of the water is three times as much as that of
 the base, and the salt agrees in composition with the formula

196              Mr. Warington      on a curious Change          in the
taric acid in excess caused the rapid and plentiful separation
of bitartrate of potash; and on evaporating a little of the solu
tion of this substance, to which a few drops of nitric acid had
been added, to dryness, a small quantity of uric acid was
evidenced by the production of the crimson stain so peculiar
to that compound; magnesia was also tested for but was not
detected.
    It is evident from this qualitative examination that this
substance was composed, for the most part, of sulphuric acid,
potash and ammonia, with a little uric acid.       The following
quantitative analyses were therefore undertaken:—5-84 grs.
of the whitest and cleanest part were selected and heated to
redness in a closed platinum crucible for some time, it lost
 1-02 gr., leaving a perfectly white and opake residue, without
much alteration of the original form of the fragments. During
this operation a slight quantity of acid vapour was given off.
This residue was boiled in distilled water, which dissolved
nearly the whole, with the exception of a few particles weigh
ing 0.06 gr., having an opake white colour, similar to the
bulk of the residue, and which proved on examination to be
the bone-earth phosphate of lime; they were slowly dissolved
in dilute nitric acid without any appearance of effervescence,
and gave indications of the presence of phosphoric acid and
lime, the first by solution of nitrate of silver, and by a solu
tion of the ammonio-chloride of magnesium, the latter by
oxalate of ammonia.      We have, therefore,
4-76 grs.         fixed residue assumed to be sulphate               of potash.

the existence   of uric acid, was evident; on re-solution in water
a  pale brown flocculent matter separated (c), similar to what
had been just noticed; this was separated by a filter and
weighed 0-11 gr. ; the solution was then evaporated to dryness
and heated to expel the excess of sulphuric acid which had
been added; the residue (d) of bi-sulphate of potash weighed
7-85 grs., equivalent to 2-94 grs. of potash. The second half
of the solution was treated with caustic potash and submitted
to distillation until reduced to a very small volume, the vola
tile products being passed into dilute hydrochloric acid; to
this a solution of chloride of platinum was added, and the
whole evaporated to dryness and then re-dissolved in a mix
ture of alcohol and aether, which left 3:44 grs. of ammonio
chloride of platinum, equivalent to 26 gr. of ammonia (e).

         the innumerable sea birds frequenting the district, and
thus giving rise        the deposit   to the guano on,           close     of                                     or   in

 200                    Dr. Hofmann        on Chloramil.
 crystalline body free from hydrogen, to which he gave the
 name chloranil.          This substance, remarkable on account of
 the series of      interesting   transformations which it undergoes
 when in contact with the alkalies, has been diligently studied
 by Erdmann.            From his experiments, the composition of
 chloranil is    represented     by the formula—
                                  C6 Cl2 O2.
 This body has lately become the starting-point of some inter
 esting discussions, which Laurent” brought before the Aca
demy at Paris. The view of this chemist assumes the equiva
 lent of chloranil to be double, agreeing with the formula,
                                  C12 Cla O.
    The method which Erdmann employed for obtaining chlo
 ranil is circuitous, and yields very little of that substance. He
 passed a stream of chlorine gas through an alcoholic solution
of chlorisatin or bichlorisatin. The following equation repre
sents the transformation of the chlorisatin into chloranil:—
                                4C1 =   Cl, Cl, O, H-4CO2 + NH3 + HCl.

        Chlorisatin.                    Chloramil.
    The process is not, however, so simple, as there is formed
at the same time chlorinated chlorindoptic acid (Laurent's
chlorophenussic acidt), as well as many other secondary pro
ducts, and there is obtained a comparatively small quantity
only of chloramil.
    Somewhat later chloranil was re-observed under other cir
cumstances.          Fritzchef found, in some experiments upon the
blue colour assumed by aniline from the action of the oxygen
compounds of chlorine, that by a continued digestion of a
mixture of chlorate of potash and hydrochloric acid upon ani
line, chloranil is also formed.
    I  have had the opportunity, in a research upon the organic
bases of coal-gas naphtha§, to confirm this statement; the
whole of the carbon of the aniline enters into the chloranil, as
the following equation shows:—
         Cla H, N, 4O + 8Cl =          C,   H, O, + NHs + 4HCl.

           Aniline.                     Chloramil.
    The close relation subsisting between the aniline and phe
nyle series induced me to try whether chloranil could not
be obtained from different members of this group of bo
dies.      I soon learnt that chloranil is often formed, as the
last product of decomposition of organic bodies, under the

 investigation with the hydrate of phenyle, and selected as a
 means of oxidation a mixture of hydrochloric acid and chlo
 rate of potash, in which oxygen and chlorine are disposable.
 When hydrate of phenyle in a porcelain basin is treated with
strong hydrochloric acid, and there is added at intervals small
crystals of chlorate of potash, a violent reaction ensues, and
the colourless             oil

to volatilize at 302° F., and between 410–428° F. the subli
mation is rapid; if it be heated above this temperature it melts,
and is finally carbonized.          The sublimate has the appearance
of an   extremely   soft, light,    iridescent powder, which remains
intact with acids, but when treated with alkalies is changed
with the greatest facility.             When the crystals are drenched
with a dilute   potash-ley,      they    acquire immediately a dark co
lour with a shade of green, but on the application of heat dis
solve to a blood-red fluid, from which purple needles of an
organic salt are deposited upon cooling. These needles, when
immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid, assume, without altering
their form, a bright red colour.             They are quite insoluble in
very dilute acids, but dissolve in pure water with a beautiful
violet hue.     By the addition of hydrochloric acid the liquid
 is discoloured immediately, and after some time the red crystals
 again deposit.
    There can be no doubt from the foregoing that the sub
 stance obtained from the hydrate of phenyle and Erdmann's
 chloranil are identical.         I have notwithstanding made some
 combustions of this compound.               The analyses were however
 made with a product which was only recrystallized from               al
 cohol, and not sublimed; the substance was therefore not
 quite pure, a circumstance, which Erdmann had found pre
 viously.    In five analyses this chemist always obtained a con
 stant excess of carbon: my analyses were also encumbered
  with the same fault, owing to which there is a discrepancy be
  tween the chlorine found and that of theory.

   The foregoing equation gives the final result of the decom
position; but         I
                  must remark that another compound precedes
the formation of the chloranil.      If the process be interrupted
when the hydrate of phenyle becomes somewhat glutinous, a
solid crystalline mass will result upon cooling, in which the
chloranil is enveloped by a red, tenacious, disagreeably-smell
ing resin, dissolving in every proportion in alcohol, and this
property allows of              its
                          easy separation from the former. When
the alcoholic solution of the resinous mass        submitted             is                       to   di
stillation, what remains       the retort becomes fluid

                                            in            potash                    in                  or

it  probable that     was chlorinated chlorindoptic acid (chloro
                          it
 phenussic acid), particularly          appeared collaterally with

XXVIII.     On Jacobi's Elliptic Functions, in reply to the

  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
     GENTLEMEN,
AS     my last paper on Elliptic Integrals does not appear to
       have met with Mr. Bronwin's approbation, I will, with
your permission, say a few more words on the question, and
these will be the last I shall trouble you with on the subject.
As Mr. Bronwin's last paper hardly professes to bring for
ward any new arguments, and complains of my not having
condescended to reply to his previous ones, I shall endeavour
at present to repair that omission.     Mr. Bronwin says (Phil.
Mag. S. 3. vol. xxiii. p. 90), “Moreover, he [Jacobi] has set out
from an assumed equation 1                         –
                                  y = f(a), p. 39, from which                                             all
the rest     the formulae are derived [and correctly derived, for
             of
Mr. Bronwin says afterwards, that “he supposes each parti
cular step     to  quite correct”].
                       be                this assumed equation    In                                      he
has not   actually  determined the   constants,  but only assumed
them.     If    had actually determined them,
                  he                                 might appear                    it
that they are not susceptible         that generality which the

Mr. Bronwin     wishes me to do, by expressing y by means of
the complementary    functions, and find that the process agrees
step by step with Jacobi's, the only difference being that the
transformation to the complementary functions is there made
at the end.                                               -
   An extraordinary assertion is the following one:–“It is
sufficient to observe that the first form of w only will satisfy
the conditions s a u = 0, s.a. u = 1, required by Jacobi's
theory, pages 40 and 41.”       If u is a misprint for v, and these
equations are to be satisfied for u = 0, Jacobi's form of s a v
certainly satisfies them in any case; the first, because of
the factor s. a. u; the second, because M is just determined
by this very condition.                       If
                               this is not the meaning, the true
one has escaped me. One word on my preceding paper: the
principal thing gained in it seems to be,           being likely                       its

And the modulus of this expression is the product of the mo
duli of the factors. The above system of types requires some
care in writing down, and not only with respect to the combi
nations of the letters, but also their order, it would be vitiated,
e.g. by writing 716 instead of 176. A theorem analogous to
that which I gave before, for quaternions, is the following:—
If A = 1 + A, 11... + x; X=ar, 1...                17,immediately             +   r.     17.   It   is

212            Mr. Napier   on the Decomposition    of
trode is an exact equivalent of another element or salt radical
liberated at the opposite electrode.     But the results of expe
rience in the deposition of metals from the above-named salts
have induced the electro-metallurgist to follow another law
somewhat at variance with that laid down by electro-chemists,
and which enables him to strengthen or weaken his solution
of metal at pleasure. Indeed there is no law which appears
to him more definite than that, if a large positive and small
negative electrode be used, there will be more dissolved from
the former than is deposited upon the latter; and on the con
trary, if a large negative and small positive electrode be used,
more will be deposited upon the negative than is dissolved
from the positive.
    Being aware of the decided manner in which electro-che
mists have laid down the law of the decomposition of electro
lytes in definite proportions, I at first looked upon the results
of practical experience with doubt, and in order to put it to
the test, and to ascertain whether the discrepancy was acci
dental or not,   I adopted the following practice:—the positive
electrode was    carefully weighed every morning, previous to
immersing it in the  gilding  or plating solution, and again when
taken out in the evening, and the loss compared with the
amount deposited, an account of which was accurately taken.
 This practice was continued for upwards of nine months,
 varying at times, as far as practicable, the relative sizes of the
two electrodes and the condition of the solutions, and during
 this period there were only five trials where the loss from the
positive was exactly the amount of the gain on the negative.
 In many cases the difference did not exceed 3 per cent., but
 the average difference was 25 per cent., and occasionally
 as high as 50 per cent, varying in a great measure with the
 condition of the solution and the relative sizes of the elec
 trodes.
    During these operations two questions suggested themselves
 as of importance; namely, Is this discrepancy of equivalent
 electrolyzation confined to the double cyanides of the metals?
 and second, Does the amount of electricity, as indicated by
 the oxidation of the zinc in the battery, correspond with the
 amount of metal deposited upon the negative electrode, or the
 quantity dissolved from the positive?
    I had observed, while making some experiments upon the
 relative endosmose of different substances, that if sulphate of
 copper be used in one division of a decomposition cell in
 which the negative electrode is placed, the other division being
 charged with water acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and

                     Metallic Salts by an Electric Current.                                     213
a copper positive electrode immersed, there is dissolved in
the positive cell an equivalent of copper for that deposited
upon the negative pole, but there is formed besides a great
quantity of white powder resembling a subchloride of copper,
slightly soluble in water, which adheres to the pole with great
tenacity, sometimes, if the current be continued several hours,
to the depth of Tºth of an inch, by which means the positive
pole will lose, according to the strength of acid and the power
of battery, from 1% to 3 times the quantity of that deposited
 upon the negative electrode.
    The substance formed and collected upon the pole I have
 not yet had an opportunity of analysing, but       general pro            its
 perties differ from those   the chloride  ofsubchloride    cop   or                       of

                                          suitable forces, overcome
their first attachment, slide past each other, and attach them
           new particles. Of course this process occupies time:

                           attachment are    greater,  compared with
the forces which produce motion; that                 the mass    is,   as

218   Dr. Whewell's Additional Remarks                  on    Glacier Theories.
The parts which were most free to        move would exert tensions
upon the rest, and would tend to produce fissures. At first, the
theorist would attend only to the direct cohesion of the mass.
If this were overcome, there would be transverse fissures; and
these would be the only results of the first form of the hypo
thesis.   But it is evident in glaciers, that the middle moves
faster than the sides.      It would be necessary to make some
provision for this difference in the hypothesis. The first sup
position might be, that the glacier is divided by arbitrary lon
gitudinal separations into strips of finite breadth; and that
these move past each other. But on this supposition, original
transverse lines on the glacier would be thrown en échellon in
definite portions. This evidently not being the case in fact, the
theorist might remodel his view. He might begin to see, that
besides the separation of a mass by overcoming the direct co
hesion, there may be separation by sliding of one part past
another. He would then be led, by simple mechanical views,
to infer that the cohesive force of the mass will yield to such
sliding tendency, in directions perpendicular to the directions
of the transverse fissures; and as the mass is still coherent after
sliding, there will be in it bands, which are the traces of the
sliding lines.      If
                   this process take place over the whole breadth
of the glacier, we are brought very near the plastic view. On
this supposition, the differences of velocity of the different parts
of a transverse line will be much the greatest near the sides,
as they are in a river, and for the same reason.          Hence any
attempt to calculate the relative motion of the parts of the
glacier would lead to the conclusion, that the flanks, at least,
must be plastic.         If
                        the conception of the change of a plastic
body, as requiring time to            its
                                    performance, were new         the      to
theorist, and had been slowly arrived                 at,   he
                                                  might, with refer
ence   tothese circumstances, term       secular plasticity: but this

resisted.   It may      said, that though plastic when considered
                         be

whether the cause of the motion is gravity, or the fluidity of
the lowest part, or the fluidity in general. Without attaching
much value to such distinctions, we may reply, that the cause
of the motion is gravity; the cause of the steadiness of the
motion is the melting of the lower surface; the cause of the
glacier character of the motion is the plasticity.

THEhydrates
     compounds formed by the action of chlorine on the
            of the alkalies and earths have long since at
 tracted the attention of chemists by their powerful bleaching
  properties. As they were produced by simply bringing to
 gether chlorine with the base in presence of water, they were at
 first considered as direct and simple combinations of chlorine
  with the oxide, and were therefore called oxychlorides.
     Berzelius first showed this view to be untenable. He con
 sidered these compounds as containing a chloride and an oxy
 gen salt of chlorine, the acid of which he assumed identical
  with that of Stadion, namely, 1 equivalent of chlorine to 3 of
 oxygen.
     Serullas obtained by the evaporation of a solution of soda,
 which had been treated with chlorine, crystals of chloride of
 sodium, while the mother-liquid retained             bleaching proper        its
 ties unaltered.     This experiment shows that             chloride and                a
 an   oxygen salt      chlorine, which possesses the bleaching pro
                           of
 perties, are contained         these compounds.

     By acting            on
                      the oxide       mercury with chlorine, Balard

 succeeded        obtaining
                 in             combination a      oxygen with chlorine,
                                                                      of

                its          properties,       well        salts, showed

 tained    in the oxychlorides.      He determined the composition
of   this acid       equivalent chlorine
                      at   1                          oxygen.        to   1   of
    Millon has endeavoured           recall the ancient view with some
                                                      to
 modification. He considers these compounds                 analogous                    as
 peroxides,          so
                  that the atoms       oxygen          of

    This view was but      imperfectly     refuted, and indeed the sub
ject remained         considerable doubt until Gay-Lussac made

stilled over unchanged.        The so-called oxychlorides, when
similarly treated, behave in the same manner.
    The process in these instances is extremely simple, if we
only recollect that hypochlorous acid with hydrochloric sets
chlorine free by forming water; or, which is the same thing,
the metal of the chloride deoxidates the hypochlorous acid in
order to be able to combine as oxide with sulphuric acid,
while from both the chlorine is set free.
    In the second instance the salt of hypochlorous acid is alone
decomposed, while no excess of sulphuric acid is present to
cause a decomposition of the chloride.
    Now if these oxychlorides were simple combinations of
chlorine with oxide, the first drop of sulphuric acid would set
free chlorine.
    Founded on the correctness of this view, this great chemist
has given us a method of preparing hypochlorous acid, far
more practical than that formerly used.             He distils the so
called chloride of lime with dilute nitric acid, which must be
very carefully added in the manner above described, and                                         di
stils off the hypochlorous acid.         He confirms Balard's state
                                Hypochlorous acid possesses, ac

manner can the chlorine             contained   be  this liquid, and in                            in

from the sulphate                   of
                          barytes, the whole          the chlorine was             of

            Decomposition       of Orides   and Salts by Chlorine.      229
            Sulphate of barytes 1-597 = 0-940 barytes.
            Chloride of silver    1998 = 0.493 chlorine.
This is rather more than 1       eq.  of chlorine.
  I   next endeavoured to ascertain the proportion of chloric
acid in this amount.       For this purpose a portion of the same
liquid was precipitated by nitrate of silver, which gave the
quantity of chlorine combined as chloride.             After separating
it from this precipitate the liquid was treated with phospho
rous acid, which naturally precipitated metallic silver and a
barytes salt, but also reduced the chloric acid. After heating
for some time, the precipitates were dissolved in nitric acid,
and the chloride of silver which formed, determined.
First precipitate of chloride of silver 4.992 = 1-182 chlorine.
Second precipitate          ---      ...      0°787 = 0: 154      ...
    This gives to 6 parts of chlorine as chloride, nearly 1 as
chlorate. The theory requires to 5 of chloride 1 of chlorate;
but part of the oxygen had probably escaped either free or
as hypochlorous acid.
    Having thus found that on treating barytes with chlorine
the decomposition takes place in so simple a manner, I next
endeavoured to find out whether the same laws would not
hold good in the case of the alkalies.           Of these I first chose
potash, which was prepared by decomposing a solution of
pure sulphate of potash by barytes water.
    I. 4-051 of this solution gave 0.272 sulphate of potash =
0.107 potash, or 3.628 per cent. 18.819 were saturated with
 chlorine, in the same manner as the barytes had been, and
gave, after reduction by ammonia and sulphurous acid, a pre
cipitate of 3.314 chloride of silver = 0.818 chlorine.
    Calculated to the amount of potash, this gives to 590 potash
 706.5 chlorine, instead of 443, which is 1 equivalent.
    II. 17.397 of the solution which was used for this determi
 nation gave 1.337 nitrate of potash = 0.6225 potash.
    19.027 gave 3.081 chloride of silver = 0.748 chlorine, or in
 590 potash 647 chlorine, instead of 443. The average of these
 two gives to 590 potash 677 chlorine, or to 2 eqs, of potash
3 of chlorine.

 as   itsbleaching properties.         contained

     What now              can be the cause                     of potash combining with a
less quantity of chlorine than is the case with barytes? This
arises probably from the stronger affinity of potash for chloric
acid, which causes a decomposition of hypochlorous acid, by
which chloric acid is formed and chlorine set free.    Hence it
is evident that by the formation of a small quantity of chloric
acid the total quantity of chlorine in the liquid must be much
diminished.
   I now    treated carbonate                  of potash in a similar manner with
chlorine, and obtained the well-known liquid, possessing, from
the first action of the chlorine, the smell and other properties
of free hypochlorous acid, a considerable quantity of which
was carried away by the escaping carbonic acid.        Now, if this
liquid be heated for some time in a water-bath, the hypochlo
rous acid is completely destroyed, chlorine is disengaged,
and the liquid now contains a mixture of chloride of potas
sium with chlorate of potash. As the hypochlorous acid was
from its first formation uncombined, the chloric acid must
have, in        all

        Decomposition           of Owides       and Salts by Chlorine.                 231
  The following is an experiment showing the nature of this
decomposition:—Treat a concentrated solution of simple car
bonate of soda with chlorine until a considerable quantity of
bicarbonate is precipitated, but not until this precipitate com
mences to be decomposed.            The liquid on being now left to
itself in the light continues for several hours to give off car
bonic acid with slight effervescence. We here have carbonate
of soda mixed with chloride of sodium and free hypochlorous
acid. These two latter, by gradually acting on each other, in
the manner above described, set chlorine free, which decom
poses the carbonate.
   Now, as by treating carbonates with chlorine hypochlorous
acid is obtained free, and can be distilled over quickly, it ap
peared to me that this might be an easy method of obtaining
this acid for use. It is desirable for this purpose to choose a
base which has not too powerful an affinity for chloric acid, and
consequently from the chloride of which, hypochlorous acid
can be quickly distilled off without decomposition.               I chose,
 with this view, carbonate of lime.
    This salt, prepared for the purpose by precipitation, was
 mixed up with about 40 parts of water, and dissolved in chlo
rine.     When quickly heated to the boiling-point, this liquid
gave off   its  hypochlorous acid, while the residue            the retort
                                                                         in

or by leaving healthy urine to stand until it becomes alka
line, the above-mentioned reactions may always be observed.
 Slightly blue litmus paper is then at first made more strongly
blue, and on drying in the air the paper becomes as red as if
the urine were fresh, or no ammonia had been added.
    This seemed to show that no free acid existed in the urine,
but that the acid reaction was caused by some ammoniacal
salt having this property of reddening litmus.
    Pure urate of ammonia, when dissolved in water or with
excess of ammonia, showed a similar reaction as the solution
evaporated from the blue litmus paper, and hence it seemed
probable that urate of ammonia was one cause of the acid
reaction of the urine.       Hippuric acid having been observed
by Liebig to be present in healthy urine, I formed hippurate
of ammonia with a slight excess of ammonia in the solution,
and I found that when this dried on litmus paper it gave a
strong acid reaction.
    It occurred to me to make the same experiment with other
salts of ammonia dissolved in cold water with an excess of
ammonia, and I found in all a similar reaction.           The salts
used were the acetate, oxalate, nitrate, sulphate, hydrochlo
rate, hydrosulphate, benzoate, phosphate, and carbonate. The
last produced much the feeblest acid reaction.
   Some sulphate of ammonia was dissolved in water: at first
it was neutral to test-paper; a drop of a solution of litmus was
added to a small cupful of this solution; after standing some
hours in the air the blue colour disappeared, and a pink solu

After twelve hours no violet colour was seen, but well-marked   a
pink tint.     The temperature was rather lower than             the          in

236              On the Decomposition of Salts of Ammonia.
    To avoid the interference of the atmosphere, solutions of
urate of ammonia and chloride of ammonium, coloured blue
with litmus, were evaporated in a very perfect vacuum over
chloride of calcium.   The solution of chloride of ammonium
became red in less than five hours.   The solution of urate of
ammonia formed a red edge, where the fluid evaporated, in
half an hour; this continued to grow broader, and after four
teen hours the basin was dry, leaving a broad red deposit on
the side.
   Two solutions of equal quantities of chloride of ammonium
were made, the one in alcohol, the other in water. They
were both coloured with blue litmus and left to evaporate in
the air. The alcoholic solution became red the soonest.
   These experiments show that salts of ammonia are decom
posed by evaporation at ordinary temperatures. It was long
since observed by Sir H. Davy, that if the same quantity of
nitrate of ammonia was dissolved in much and little water,
the loss on evaporation by boiling was directly in proportion
to the quantity of water used.   Part was probably carried off
by the steam, but the above experiments show that it was
partly decomposed, the ammonia being separated from                                                    its
combination with nitric acid.                                                                                  y
   H. Rose also observed the decomposition        the sulphate                   of
of ammonia when evaporated          boiling temperature. He
                                                  at   a

XXXV.          On the Mechanism of Glacial Motion. Third Letter.
              By W. Hopkins, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., &c.
  To the      Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
       PROCEED        to offer some critical remarks on the mecha
       nical  reasoning    employed by Prof. Forbes to account for
phaenomena connected with the motion of glaciers.
    1. Let us first consider the reasoning by which he deter
mines the direction of marimum tension.               It appears to me
embodied in what he has said on the              subject   in the note of
page 378 of his Travels.            He observes, “The experiment
on a model, described in this note, is more strictly analogous
to the glacier phaenomena, than those of a more striking kind
described in the text, page 379, where the succession of co
lours naturally gives to the mind the impression of a primitive
structure near the origin of the glacier, which is mechanically
deformed into these conchoidal surfaces.            They strikingly re
call, however, this important fact, that the direction of maxi
mum distension of the particles must be, not parallel to the
length of the glacier, but in the direction of the branches of
these elongated loops, since their elongation is the simple re
sult of the mechanical tension to which they are subjected.”
The loops here spoken of are those formed in models of plas
 ter    Paris, described
       of                        of by
                                  Prof. Forbes when the descending
stream was composed             “alternate doses                 of
                                                        white and blue
fluid poured        successively.” They are identical,
                    in                                          conceive,     I
with the    loop  P'Q'    represented     fig.
                                          in          my5. last letter,
                                                                of                        as
that into which          transverse
                          a           element,   originally   rectilinear,
would        be
              converted         by
                               the more rapid motion          the central of
part    ofthe glacier.
   Again, the Professor observes               the same note, “The
                                               in
least distance which can ever exist between              side and    acen            a
tral particle       ofcanal-shaped glacier,        half the breadth                      of
                                                        of is
                      a

tends continually         separate them wider apart, and
                          to                                      distend       to
the row       ofparticles   which connects them.        The structural
bands are, therefore, perpendicular                to
                                               the line     greatest ten of

                                          have found empirically to be
the case.”
    The error in this reasoning will be at once apparent to
any one who has followed the simple reasoning by which, in
articles 4 and 5 of my last letter,                        I
                                              have determined the line
of  greatest   extension. The Professor's conclusion is equiva
lent to the assertion that the line M l, in the figure of the
                                          to,
articles just referred             the line     question, instead                                    of       M   n,

                      to                         approximately       coincide
unless the extensibility were very great                     easily seen by
                                                                        *,    as   is
referring        the construction given           art.          my previous    17     of
                                                                 noin

maximum and minimum tension.
  If   we consider the Professor's reasoning with reference                                                        to
 my analytical investigations,            will appear obvious that his
                                                      it
 error consists      the omission of all consideration of the effects
                           in
of   the tangential forces, those forces,             fact, which give  in                                         to

tension along M n is a maximum.          Consequently there must
be a tangential force called into action between these elements,
acting on the former towards M and on the latter from M.
Again, take another pair of contiguous elements terminating
originally in M and Q, and, after the motion, in M and q,
where Q q = Pp. Of these two elements along M q, the one
nearest to M n will be extended the most, and therefore the
 tangential force called into action will act from M on the ele
 ment most remote from M n, and towards M! on the other.
 Hence the tangential action between two elements for which
 the line of separation is situated on one side of M n being
 called positive, that for two other elements whose line of sepa
 ration is on the opposite side of M n, will be negative, and
 therefore, when the line of separation coincides with M n, the
 tangential action must = 0.
     The conclusions from this mode of reasoning are identical
 with those deduced from the two independent investigations
 previously given (articles 7–12, and 17, Second Letter).              I
 might have contented myself with an appeal to those investi
 gations, but it appears to me that the reasoning now employed
 is better calculated to point out the fallacy of that by which,
 as I conceive, the conclusion of Prof. Forbes has been arrived
 at.
     I maintain, then, that in the directions of maximum tension,
 which   may   be considered as approximately perpendicular to
 the transverse fissures, there is no tendency whatever in con
 tiguous particles of a glacier to slide past each other, or, there
 fore, to produce in those directions planes of discontinuity;
 and, consequently, that the alternate bands of blue and white
 ice cannot have their    origin in a system of fractures so pro
 duced, assuming always the approximate truth of the law di
 stinctly announced by Prof. Forbes, that the bands do approxi
 mate to perpendicularity to the general directions of the trans
 verse fissures, where the two sets of phaenomena are best de
 fined.
     4. But further than this,  I contend that though we should
 allow the bands of blue and white ice to exist in those direc
 tions in which there is the greatest tendency to form these
 planes of discontinuity, those bands could not be thus ac
 counted for, because I conceive it to be mechanically impos
 sible, under the conditions to which       I believe glaciers to be
 subjected, that a system of planes of discontinuity, in which
  the planes are parallel and at distances varying from the frac
  tion of an inch to a few inches from each other, could be pro
  duced by the internal forces of constraint independently of

 must be referred.       I shall perhaps best explain the nature of
 this difficulty in Prof. Forbes's theory by a reference to the
 case of fissures formed by the normal force in directions per
 pendicular to those of greatest tension, when that tension be
 comes greater than the cohesion.         Suppose the tensions to be
 the same at every point, and the mass perfectly
 There will be no more reason for the formation of a fissure at
 one point than at another, and it is conceivable, as a mere
abstraction, that an infinite number of fissures should be
 formed at the same instant; but practically, the perfect homo
geneity of the mass cannot exist, and therefore fissures will
begin at the same instant at comparatively few points, perhaps
only at a single point.       This will more especially be the case
if the tension be      slowly  and continuously increased           the                                          till

 perpendicular to that of greatest pressure, would seem to
establish a relation between the laminar structure and the
 internal forces of constraint, which may possibly afford the
key to a satisfactory physical explanation of the bands in
 question.       I do not profess however to offer any theory on the
 subject.
    5. There is another point, connected with Professor Forbes's
 theory of the mode of progression of glaciers, which calls for
 a few remarks.         I mean the frontal dip of the structural sur
 faces, which Prof. Forbes accounts for as follows:–                           any               “....
 particle in a fluid or semifluid mass, urged by a force from
 above, does not necessarily move in the direction in which the
 force impels            moves diagonally; forwards,
                         it,   it                                   consequence         in
of   the impulse; upwards,              consequence in        the resistance      of                           in

                                                      separation, shaped (to
 use a   familiar illustration) somewhat like the mouth                      coal                of   a
 scuttle   or  sugar-scoop, will rise toward the surface, varied                                               in

                    the law      velocity of    the different layers
                                                                 of            the                     of

                                    is                           the separation        of
planes, which are those                         of
                                        apparent cleavage, will               very                    be
highly inclined. As the lower end                the   glacier   of approached,
the resistance continually diminishes, the line                      least resist       of is

away altogether, and the upper layers roll over the lower ones,
now wholly unsupported.”
     In the first place,        would remark that whatever validity
                                     I
this mechanical         reasoning     may have, depends                the hypo             on

letter, that my investigations involve the condition of conti
nuity in the same manner as the common investigations of the
motions of fluids.   In these latter motions, however, there is
one obvious case in which that condition is not satisfied—that
in which the motion results from the heating of the lower por
tion of the fluid contained in a vessel, as in the ordinary case
of boiling water. It would seem that at every point of the
fluid mass, some particles must be ascending and some de
scending, which is inconsistent with the condition of conti
nuity as here understood.             In solid bodies we may conceive

            Mr. Hopkins                   on the Mechanism                   of Glacial Motion.                    249
  that such is the case.         The only reason which has been
 assigned    in favour of that opinion is derived from the ana
  logy which such motion would bear to the motion of the
  centre of a glacier relatively to          sides.                  its
                                                               said that                 It    is                   as
  the centre moves faster than the sides,                may       conclude          so             we
  that the upper portion must move faster than the lower. Now
        not denied that the argument           good          certain extent,
it   is                                                                is                to

  but the question       entirely one
                                  is       degree.      We have   of    right                              no
 to   conclude that the relative motion              the one case will be       in
 equal       to
             that      the other, since the conditions
                             in                                     the two                           in
 cases are different.     The depth           glacier                of
                                                           much less than
                                                                       a                  is
 its  semi-width; the continuity          the mass              of

 unbroken              by
                  horizontal planes; also the vertical pressure,
 where the depth          considerable,
                                   is          probably much greater   is
 near the bottom than the horizontal pressure near the sides
 the glacier.     All these are reasons why the relative motion                                                     of of
 the   upper  and lower surfaces should           less than that          thebe                               of

therefore         be
                necessary   generally    that the excess        the motion                       of
of   the upper surface over that            the lower one, should of                                                be

mechanical impossibility,          appears       me extremely difficult

Dec. 12,   “     N the Laws of the Tides     on the Coast of Ireland, as
   1844.           inferred from an extensive series of observations
made   in connexion with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland.” By George
Biddell Airy, Esq., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
    The elaborate investigations of which the results are communi
cated in the present paper, were suggested by the necessity of
adopting some standard mean height of the sea, as a line of refer
ence for the elevations ascertained in the operations of the Ordnance
Survey of Ireland. Colonel Colby, R.E, who conducted that survey,
had with this view determined to institute a series of observations
on the height of the water in different states of the tide; and con
ceiving that these observations might be made subservient to im
provement in the theory of the tides, requested the assistance of the
author in laying down the plan of observation best calculated to
effect that object.     The suggestions which were, in consequence,
made    by the author were adopted in their utmost extent by Colonel
Colby; and the collection of observations was placed in the author's
hands in the winter of 1842. The whole number of observations
exceeds two hundred thousand; and they derive extraordinary value
from the circumstance of the localities, of their simultaneity, their
extensive range, and the uniformity of plan on which they were con
ducted. Their reduction was made by the computers at the Royal
Observatory, Greenwich, under the superintendence of the author,
and with the authority of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury;
The nature of the different branches of the inquiry may be gathered
from the titles of the several sections into which the paper is divided,
and which are as follows:–
    Section I-Account of the stations, levellings, times and methods
of observation.
    Section II.-Methods of extracting from the observations the
times of high and low water; of supplying deficient times and
heights; and of correcting the times first determined.
    Section III.-Theory of diurnal tide as related to observations
only; and deduction of the principal results for diurnal tide given
immediately by these observations.

Bodies generally                existing as Gases.”                By Michael Faraday, Esq.,
F.R.S., D.C.L., &c.”
   The method employed by the author for examining the capability
of gases to assume the liquid or solid form, consisted in combining
the condensing powers of mechanical compression with that of very
considerable depressions of temperature. The first object was ob
tained by the successive action of two air-pumps; the first having a
piston of one inch in diameter, by which the gas to be condensed
was forced into the cylinder of the second pump, the diameter of
whose piston was only half an inch.              The tubes into which the air,
thus further       condensed,     was made to pass, were of green bottle
glass, from one-sixth to one-quarter of an inch in external diameter,
and had a curvature at one portion of their length adapted to im
mersion in a cooling mixture: they were provided with suitable
stop-cocks, screws, connecting pieces, and terminal caps,                         very                  all
carefully made, and rendered sufficiently air-tight                       retain their        to

Sulphuretted hydrogen solidified in masses of confused crystals of a
white colour, at a temperature of –122°Fahr.           Euchlorine was
easily converted from the gaseous state into a solid crystalline body,
which, by a slight increase of temperature, melted into an orange
red fluid.   Nitrous oxide was obtained solid at the temperature of
the carbonic acid bath in vacuo, and then appeared as a beautifully
clear and colourless crystalline body. The author conceives that in
this state it might, in certain cases, be substituted with advantage
for carbonic acid in frigorific processes, for arriving at degrees of
cold far below those hitherto attained by the employment of the
latter substance. Ammonia was obtained in the state of solid white
crystals, and retained this form at a temperature of      103°.                                     –

   As the right ascensions of Sirius, which are given for the be
ginning of each year in the Tabulae Regiomontanae, are obtained by
comparison of the right ascension in 1755 with that in 1825, their
agreement with the observations of the latter years was complete;
but, as early as the year 1835, fifty observations showed, when com
pared with the three fundamental stars following Sirius, viz. 3 and
a. Orionis and a Canis Minoris, that 0°-188 must be added                       to the
Tabulae   Regiomontana,        to make the     agreement     again   perfect.     This
disagreement has been since still increasing.                  In the year 1843                                    I

   These tables show that the determinations for 1820 and 1825 are

on at

relative declination of Procyon for 1755 to appear to be 7" in error,
and the relative right ascension of Sirius for 1755 more than a se
cond of time. That so great errors cannot exist is proved by the
different checks in the Fundamenta Astronomiae; but Lacaille's and
Tobias Mayer's contemporary results leave no doubt on this point,
although they cannot determine it within 2" in declination and 1-4th
of a second in right ascension. I regard also as a result rendered
certain by the observations, that the supposition of an unchanged
proper motion in the case of the relative declination of Procyon, and
in the case of the relative proper motion of Sirius in right ascension,
is shown to be false.
   The law of the change of each of the two motions is not yet
known with sufficient exactness by the observations given.                          If
Piazzi's determination of the relative declination of Procyon is cor
rect (as I believe it to be)*, then has the difference, between 1755
and 1820, reached a positive maximum.                  In the case of the right
ascension of     Sirius,  I have    sought     to obtain a more approximate
knowledge of                    its
                      change, through the following                      the results           up    of
of the observations with the transit instrument which Pond (vol. for
1811–12) published, and by              new reduction        a   Maskelyne's ob           of
servations. This has         given     positive    maximuma          the difference             of
from the Tabulae Regiomontana                about 0°3, between 1790 and

double stars, the change of their motions would not surprise us; we
should acknowledge them as necessary, and have only to investigate
their amount by observation.       But light is no real property of
mass.    The existence of numberless visible stars can prove nothing
against the existence of numberless invisible ones. There have been
also stars which seemed to possess the peculiarity of a bright body
passing over, and which have again lost it; for example, the star of
Tycho.    The phaenomena then of the varying motions of the stars,
which are so important for the results of plane astronomy, seem also
to possess interest in relation to our knowledge of the physical con
stitution of the universe.

proving at least one other disturbance in addition.       Subsequent to
these   great disturbing changes,  there occurred a series of elevations
and depressions, indicated by mixed beaches and sea-bottoms at dif
ferent levels and by the surface of the rock perforated by Lithodomi
and sea-worn to the very summit, indicating that the amount of
change of level in these comparatively modern times—for the fossils
in these deposits are in every case identical with species now living
in the neighbouring seas—exceeded the height of the mountain, or
1470 feet.     There are evidences, also, of a series of movements of
depression. All these changes must have preceded the historical
period, as previous to the last change, Gibraltar must have been an
island, of which there is no record; the most ancient accounts de
scribing it as it is now. The upheaving forces must have been deep
seated, as there are no erupted igneous rocks near.
   December 4.—A paper was read, entitled, “Remarks on the Geo
logy of British Guiana.” By the Chevalier Robert H. Schomburgk.
   The geology of the district of British Guiana is chiefly confined to
primitive rocks.     At the mouth of the Orinoco is an extensive delta
consisting of blue clay, which, when pierced, gives a supply of water,
and Artesian wells have been suuk here in many places with success.
Below the clay appear the remains of an ancient forest. The allu
vial flat is terminated by sand-hills, beyond which occurs granite    in
tersected by numerous greenstone dykes, and then commence the
savannahs, which are traversed by large beds of conglomerate often
containing iron ore, and pierced with lofty porphyritic hills. The
savannahs are supposed to be the bed of an ancient lake. A region
in which much jasper occurs next succeeds, and then a remarkable
range of granitic mountains; and the author directed especial atten
tion to the insulated rocks of grotesque form abounding in the di
strict.    He also remarked on the probability of gold being found in
the river-courses, and on the appearance of the well-known diamond
matrix of Brazil.
    A letter was next read from Mr. Trevelyan, remarking on the oc
 currence of polished and scratched surfaces in the neighbourhood of
Conway, on the ascent of Moel Siabod, from Capel Carig, on Snow
 don, and in other localities in North Wales.

the Chalk and Chalk-rubble of Norfolk.” By Joshua Trimmer, Esq.
    The observations recorded in the present paper were made in chalk
pits near Norwich, and the surface of the chalk was observed to be
furrowed by irregular cavities, or deep cylindrical conical pipes, en
tering the chalk from the channeled surface.*     The contents of the
furrows appeared to be fine sand mixed with a light-coloured amber
or yellow ochre, the former often filling up the cavities both here
and elsewhere. The author considers, that although chemical agency
may have assisted in the formation of these cavities and pipes, yet
that it is necessary to admit also mechanical action, and he refers to
several instances of the known effects of rain-water on cliffs, and ex

      N  the above-named days I noticed rare and interesting phaeno
         mena, which in my opinion are worthy of being recorded.
   For two or three days prior to the 20th the weather had been
showery, with slight frosts at night.

                     Mock-Moon and Aurora Borealis.
    8" 30" p.m.—A brilliant halo of 45° in diameter encircled the
moon. On turning to the direction of N. a very vivid and beautiful
display of aurora borealis was disclosed to my sight. A broad stream
of flame extended from the horizon through the constellations Auriga,
Capella, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Cygnus and Lyra, and disappeared in
the western horizon, near Serpentarius. This band flickered brightly
for fifteen minutes, when it vanished.

flame, not glaring upwards, but along the horizon: therefore the
chief portion of light was reflected from below.    Paraselena still

   The following process yields a pure and perfectly crystallized oxide
of chromium:—heat neutral chromate of potash to redness in a por
celain tube, and pass a current of chlorine over it; the chlorine is en
tirely absorbed, oxygen is disengaged, and there remains in the tube
a mixture of oxide of chromium in fine crystals, and chloride of po
tassium: this crystallization of oxide of chromium appears to have
some analogy with that of peroxide of iron in the calcination of a
mixture of common salt and sulphate of iron.
   The temperature at which the reaction is effected influences the
crystallization of the oxide; when the operation is conducted at a
low temperature, the oxide is in large transparent laminae of a green
colour; but when the chlorine is passed over the chromate previously
made very hot, the oxide of chromium produced is then black and
very hard, and resembles that prepared by M. Wöhler's process,
which consists in decomposing by heat the bichromate of perchloride
of chromium.—Ann. de Ch. et de Phys., December 1844.
        PERCHLORIDE OF CHROMIUM.           BY M. won LER.
  By the following process a chloride of chromium is obtained which
contains more chlorine than the protochloride:—put into a porcelain
tube some peach-blossom coloured crystallized anhydrous chloride of
chromium; heat it and pass over it a current of chlorine; it is rea
dily converted into a brown substance, which sublimes and has all
the properties of a perchloride.
   This perchloride differs, in the first place, from the protochloride
        colour; secondly, the anhydrous protochloride
       be its

              on HEMIPINIC ACID.           By M. won LER.
   This is the product of the oxidizement of opianic acid. It is pre
pared with difficulty, because it is destroyed by the same influences
as those by which it is produced.       It is obtained as follows:—heat
together to ebullition opianic acid and peroxide of lead, then drop
gradually into the mixture sulphuric acid to disengage carbonic acid.
A small quantity of the liquid is then to be allowed to cool, and a
sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid is to be added to precipitate all
the lead which has been dissolved; filter and evaporate the solution.
It often happens that the crystals first obtained are opianic acid,
which are however easily separated from the hemipinic acid by cry
stallization, the latter being much more soluble; peroxide of lead
alone does not act upon opianic acid.
   Hemipinic acid crystallizes very readily in colourless oblique four
sided prisms; it has a slightly sour and astringent taste, and dis
solves readily in cold water. The solution has a strong acid reac
tion; alcohol dissolves this acid readily; the crystals exposed to 212°
lose 1373 per cent., or two equivalents of water. The effloresced
acid fuses at 356° and becomes a crystalline mass on cooling; when
heated between pieces of glass, it sublimes like benzoic acid in bril
liant laminae; it burns with flame, and when heated with peroxide of
lead and sulphuric acid, it appears to be entirely converted into car
bonic acid and water; with ammonia it forms a readily soluble cry
stallizable salt, which is unalterable in the air. The salts of silver and
lead are white and insoluble; the latter is soluble in acetate of lead,
 and separates later from solution in mammillated crystals.

tina with sulphuric acid and peroxide of lead, but this process did
not always succeed. The narcotina is not acted upon by the per
oxide of lead alone; but when dilute sulphuric acid is poured upon
a mixture of the peroxide and narcotina, the mass becomes hot, ac
companied with a rapid escape of carbonic acid gas; the solution
which remains after the reaction possesses a yellow colour and a very
bitter taste; dependent upon the nature and duration of the reaction,
the liquid contains cotarnina, opianic acid, and probably other pro
ducts. The carbonic acid disengaged sometimes has the smell of
cyanogen, but the presence of this substance was not proved.—

                                        NEW COMET.
   A large comet was discovered at Nevis (West Indies) on the even
ing of the 5th of January last, at sunset, in the constellation Grus.
It is described as a very splendid object, the nucleus being distinctly
visible, and the tail extending to a length of 10°. On the 6th of
January it was near 3 Gruis; on the 9th it made a near approach to
the star 9 in the same constellation.    In the four days, from Jan. 6
to Jan.  10, its motion in right ascension was -H46", and its motion
 in south polar  distance +52'.

               or Macigno Formation in the South of Europe.                                       275
Ammonites; one in the pietra forte, with which the city of
Florence is paved, the other in the macigno of the environs of
Genoa.    These discoveries are important, on account of the
rarity of animal remains in the formation which we are now
considering.    Carbonaceous deposits are also found in the
macigno, such as the stipites of Pupiglio in the Pistojais, of
the valley of the Taro, in Lunigiana, &c. *
      I will now     say a few words of the extent of this formation
in Italy.         In the map of Sicily by M. Hoffmann, it is repre
sented         by the grès apennin a fucoides, by the conglomerate
subordinate to the latter, and by the argillaceous schists. In
the country of Naples, on this side of the lighthouse, the forma
tion of the macigno is very rare;                             I
                                        have only observed it in
the mountains of Bovino in the Capitanate, with Fucoids quite
similar to those of the Tuscan macigno.         I could not point
out the    spots in the  Papal   states where this formation is
found, with the exception of the Apennines of Bologna, where
it is continuous with that of Florence.     The macigno of Tus
cany, of the Modenese and of Liguria is so classic, that                                           I
shall content myself with merely naming it here.        It is also
found, and very distinct, at the foot of the Alps of Lombardy,
especially in the environs of Gavirate, where it has been ex
amined by the Geological Section of the meeting held at Milan.
This locality is very remarkable, not only for the great number
of Fucoids perfectly similar to those of the macigno of Florence
which it contains, but also for other species which remain to
be determined by some able algologist.

     Inthis part the author attempts to establish the fact, that
three  deposits of nummulites are distinguishable in Italy:—1st,
the  tertiary ones of the Vicentin,                     if,

we shall presently remark.
    The macigno            Tuscany andof        Liguria, which of     the most                   is
classic, has                 no
                     mineralogical analogy with the chalk                   the                        of
north-west          Europe; the rocks which compose
                            of                                      have quite            it
peculiar characters. To this difference we must add another
very remarkable circumstance; the flint, which appears                                                    to   be
   substance almost inseparable from the upper northern chalk,
is aentirely wanting           the Italian macigno; and, although this

                                               general

is     great weight
       of                   this   special
                                         incase. There have likewise not
been found any             those green particles which are frequently

takes its name.
    With regard           the superposition, we have seen, first, that

limestone (Tuscany); lastly, at another locality on crystalline
rocks (Isle of Elba).     And it is a truly remarkable thing, that
in Tuscany, where this formation is very greatly developed, it
is never found associated with the nummulitico-hippuritic
limestone,—so independent is it of this latter.
   In the last place come the fossils to confirm the distinction
established. There has never been found, either in the ma
cigno of Tuscany, or in that of any other locality, that I know,
any fossil belonging to the chalk formation of the north-west
of Europe. It is a well-known fact, that the principal organic
remains which characterize this formation are the Fucoids.
Now these are wholly wanting in the northern chalk forma
tion; and, a fact which deserves to be remarked, they are
also wanting in the southern nummulitico-hippuritic limestone.
On the contrary, the Rudista, which are very abundant in this
last deposit, may be considered as entirely foreign to the first,

prove evidently that the macigno formation is wholly inde
pendent of the chalk formation, and that it may be separated
from it by characters of a greater value than those which have
served to determine the distinction of the Devonian and Silu
rian carboniferous formations. We must consider it as the last
secondary deposit, occupying a place between the chalk and
the tertiary formations.        In the period in which it was depo
sited a change had taken place in the nature of the sediments
in relation to those of the anterior (cretaceous) period; the
one had been entirely calcareous, the others in great part
arenaceous. In the period of the maciguo, the family of the
Iludista had ceased to people the seas of the south of Europe,
and with it had disappeared also the Nerinea, and almost the
whole of the Actionellae; only some few species of Nummu
lites and Ammonites had continued their languishing existence,
to become extinct at the end of these deposits. These consi
derations authorize me then to distinguish the macigno as a
formation of a particular age, and to assign to it a special name,
on account of the great part it acts in the sediments of southern
Europe. I propose to name it the Etrurian System, for the
reason that it has been recognised for the first time in a clas
sical manner in the soil of Tuscany. I conclude these obser
vations on the macigno, and on the chalk formation of Italy,
by confronting their divisions in a Table with those of the
northern chalk.

  These measurements were executed in the following man
ner:—I observed the time when the inferior portion of the
rainbow touched certain terrestrial objects, whose azimuth and
height I subsequently determined, and then compared with the
places of the sun taken from the astronomical Ephemeris for the
time in question.     The refraction of the sun, the influence of
which is small for the portion of the rainbow situated near the
horizon, has been neglected. The azimuths of the terrestrial
objects were determined by a terrestrial object, whose azimuth
was previously known and was tested by comparison with an
azimuth of the sun. The reduction to the brightest part of
the spectrum has been computed approximatively according
to Fraunhofer's figure of the spectrum of the sun, and cannot
for several reasons lay claim to any great accuracy.           with                                 If,
                                                                                                               is be

XLII.    Observations on a Communication made by Dr. Fitton
  to the Geological Society of France at the Meeting of May 20,
  1844, on the Lower Greensand of the Isle of Wight. By
  Prof. A. LEYMERIE *.

            be
        manner     chalk formation of Champagne,
                    the                                    I could

not remain indifferent to the discovery recently made in En
gland, at the base of the Greensand, of strata containing a cer
tain number of Neocomian fossils of the east of France. I took
a lively interest in the communications upon this subject, both
in the Proceedings of the Geological Society of London, which
have been obligingly communicated to me by Dr. Fitton f, and
in the Bulletin de la Société Géologique de France (vol. i. of the
second series, p. 438).
    The principal object of this note is to express Iny opinion
on the relations which may connect these new strata with the
Neocomian formation of the continent. However, it seems to
me indispensable, before coming to this, to cast a critical glance
on the list of species which Dr. Fitton considers as being com
mon to thegreensand of England and the Neocomian formation
of France, and to show that several species which M. Deshayes
and myself have established, are there wrongly represented as
related to types formerly known by Sowerby and Nilson.
    The contested species in question are given in the following
list, in which   Ihave placed opposite to each other our names
and those which Mr. Edward Forbes has substituted for them.

having again compared them carefully, under the eyes of
M. Deshayes, with the types to which Mr. Forbes has referred

terminations of this conchyliologist are wholly inadmissible.

     To convince the Society of this, it will suffice to recall here
 the principal differential characters which led me, in 1842, to
consider the species in question as new; characters the ma
jority of which had already been indicated in the short de
scriptions annexed to my memoir.
   Pholadomya Prevosti, Desh., differs from the Mya plicata,
 Sow., by an abrupt inflection which it bears on each of                                           its
valves, close    the posterior margin,
                      to                                  by   its
                                                more oblong form,
diminishing more rapidly       height from one extremity
                                      in                         the                          to
other.    Moreover the species       Sowerbyof        Panopaea, ac   is   a
cording      M. Deshayes, whilst that
            to                              l’Aube belongsof     the                          to
genus Pholadomya.
   Astarte Beaumontii, Leym.—According            the figures, the   to
                           any  to     compare  this species with
                                                 is to
idea would not occur            one
the Astarte obovata, Sow., which      much less depressed (bien
plus haute), more equilateral and subtruncated.     The descrip
tion   ofthe English author     moreover not
                                      is     sufficiently  explicit
to lead     any conclusion.
            to
   Cardium subhillanum, Leym.—I have indicated             my text                  in
the characters which separate this species from the Cardium
striatulum, Sow., which toward the middle              valves has     of      its
only concentric striae, whereas     ours the principal
                                            in          striae are,
 on the contrary, longitudinal.
     Cucullaea    Gabrielis, Leym.—We have pointed out with                                        so
much care the important differences which separate this spe
cies from the Arca evaltata, Nilson, that we cannot but think
that Mr. Edward Forbes has not consulted our text before
deciding     on
            assimilating two such different shells.
   Pinna sulcifera, Desh.-The characters        which this Pinna by
is distinguished from the Pinna tetragona, Sow., are          ob                          so
vious and        so
               easy             be
                           perceived
                           to          the first glance, that we
                                                   at
are very much surprised that Mr. Forbes should have mis
conceived them so far            as   to
                                confound these two shells.     In
fact, besides the general form, which    very different, our spe
                                                         is
cies has round and well-marked costae, separated             well                        by
marked furrows, whereas the Pinna tetragona, Sow, only ex
hibits slight striae.
    Pecten interstriatus, Leym.—This Pecten       principally cha    is
racterized       by
                the striae which cover the intervals   the costae,            of
striae which do not exist       the Pecten obliquus, Sow.
                                     in                      This
last species  has moreover costae much more distant from each
other, and     very different general form.
                 a
    Modiola Archiaci, Leym.—We might perhaps condemn this
species, which much resembles          fact the Modiola aqualis,
                                              in

                                      of the Isle of Wight.                                                      283
Sow.     We had considered it as a new Modiola, on account
of an undulation which the salient angle of each valve presents,
a character which is not seen in the species of Sowerby, which
is besides more rounded at                      its
                                inferior extremity.

    For our part, these conclusions would not appear                                                         to     us

   The chalk formation of Champagne is divided, first, very
distinctly, into two principal parts, one of which, our chalk
properly so called, is formed, in fact, throughout       whole                            its
thickness, only            of

has described it.
   Between this stage and the Jurassic system         seen   series             is         a
of very varied strata and very rich       fossils,         in
                                                     which we can              in
distinguish two more new stages separated palaeontologically
by   a stratum            of
                      remarkable constancy throughout France,

   The lower    stage     this horizonon
                                       represents  the Neocomian

last layer, corresponds  the greensand    the English, whose

subdivisions are not found here, although the thin layer con
taining the Exogyra sinuata has strongly-marked relations with
the lower greensand.

cording       the fossils, and which also differ greatly

geological phaenomenon, rather slight indeed, but which has
left very marked traces           Champagne.
                                           in      These traces, which
we have specially mentioned               note inserted

mity   of i.
           stratification: thus near Chaource, for example, we
see the clays with Earogyra sinuata, and the greensand, quite
entire, reposing          the foot
                               at                of   an

the Neocomian.
   This last formation then constitutes             the Aube, and we
might say also          the Jura,     the south     France, and        of in

lower cretaceous formation.           Let us now examine whether
this synchronism can                   be
                               admitted.
  If   we transport ourselves into the south-east part        England,               of
we see,    in  circumscribed space,
               a                          large deposit
                                                      a    fresh-water,         of
principally sandy and clayey, which            comprised between two
absolutely marine formations, one                          of is
                                              which (Portland stone),
almost exclusively calcareous, finds             representative  itsour                         in
countries        the compact and oolitic limestones which we de
                in

                                   of the Isle of Wight.                                           285
signate, with M.M.                Thirria and Thurmann, by the epithet of
Portlandian.          The other formation, that which occupies the
upper part, is the lower greensand, which admits as                       pecu              its
liar and     evidently   characteristic fossil the      Exogyra     sinuata,                           so
constant on the continent above the Neocomian formation.
     Thus here are two formations, one marine (Neocomian
formation), and the freshwater (Wealden), which appear                                      is         be
comprised between the same limits, and                    which         to   the       it   in to
first place very natural            assign the same level.
                                        to                         The follow
ing considerations support this view.
     When the Wealden, the extended prevalence                        which be         of
 speaks lengthened time
           a                            deposition, was formed
                                             of                               es            in    an
 tuary into which fresh water flowed abundantly, the ordinary
 sedimentation was probably not suspended                     the seas       in
                                                                            that              at
 epoch; there must therefore have been sediments deposited
 on    the margin        these seas, and these sediments appear
                             of                                                                   to   us
 to be the Neocomian formation.
     Some would now regard the freshwater strata                    the Wealds     of
 as   the representative          the last deposits

 the waters of the seas would have invaded the country of the
 Wealds, carrying with it the germs of the Neocomian species,
 which are now found among those of the greensand, and the
 greatest part of which we have already mentioned in our me
 moir. We shall remark, in conclusion, that these species are
 found associated, in the lower strata recently discovered in
 England, with fossils which are only found in France in the
 bed for which we have reserved the name of greensand. Be
 sides the Earogyra sinuata, we could cite the Ammonites Des
 hayesi, Pecten interstriatus, Plicatula pectinoides, Terebratula
 sella, T. elegans, and others which we have never met with in
 the Neocomian strata.
        After the reading of this paper, M.A. d’Orbigny announced
 that     Dr. Fitton had brought him some fossils from the Isle of
 Wight, and that on seeing them he had not the least doubt left
 that that formation was the Neocomian formation: there are
 from fifteen to twenty well-characterized Neocomian species,
 which admit of no uncertainty.          There is not the least sepa
 ration, in England, between the end of the gault or Aptian
 formation and the Neocomian formation.
    M. de Roys said that he had shown to the geologists of
 Vaucluse Dr. Fitton's list of fossils; they recognised            these             all
            belonging       the upper portion.
            A. as
fossils                                to
    M.      d’Orbigny cited the Perna Mulleti among these fos
                       the lower part
                              of                            of

sils     a                                  the Neocomian formation.
It  is certain, however, that the greatest number           the species     of
belong        to
             the upper   part.        other  respects In  concurred        he
the views        M. Leymerie respecting the determinations
                       of                                                                  of in
the fossils of Dr. Fitton.
    M. Leymerie stated that there was one difference between
his ideas and those        M.      d’Orbigny. The strata contain

                              some Neocomian fossils are found                             in

XLIII.      On the Laws of Reflexion and Refraction at the Sur
   faces of Substances of High Refracting and Absorbing Powers,
    such as Metals.        By the Rev. M. O’BRIEN, late Fellow of
    Caius   College,   Cambridge,     and Professor of Natural Philo
    sophy and Astronomy in King's College, London,
                      [The subject resumed from p. 123.]
  To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
           a former communication I mentioned that I had                    in
1.
     IN vestigated      the laws of reflexion and refraction at            the
surface of a transparent substance, the particles of which are
supposed to resist the vibrations of the aethereal fluid ; I shall
now briefly state and prove these laws, and show how they
may be tested by experiment.               In a memoir printed in the
Cambridge Transactions, vol. viii. p. 7, I have obtained cer
tain results”, which, if true, show the great importance of
taking properly into account the normal as well as the trans
versal waves, in investigating the laws of reflexion and refrac
tion. These results, as well as the notation and method em
ployed in that memoir, I shall now make use of without further
explanation. The waves are supposed to be plane waves, and
the refracting surface is also supposed to be plane.
    2. The following are the laws of reflea-ion and refraction
for vibrations perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
    Let the general expression for the incident disturbance be
                       a cos (n  t-k     (pa -- sz)},
the refracting surface being taken as the plane of a y, and the
plane of incidence as the plane of a 2: ; p and s being the sine
and cosine of the angle of incidence, which angle we shall
denote by the letter p.
    Then the general expression for the reflected disturbance
will be (as we shall presently prove),
               – Pacos      {n t — k   (pa    –   s 2) —   0};
and the expression for the refracted disturbance will be
ae-ºxº<U+017F>cos {nt—k(pr-1             a 2)} –Pcos (nt—k(pa         + q2)—?) }.
   * I shall just state one of these results, to show the importance of taking
into account the normal waves. If a” be the intensity of a ray incident on
a surface of high refractive power, the intensity of the reflected ray, when
the tangent of the angle of incidence is a, will be
                            (2–1)*(v*–1)                a”,
a  being the index of refraction for transversal waves, and v that for normal.
This remarkable result fully explains the peculiarities of reflexion at highly
refractive surfaces (see the Memoir, p. 26).

      4. The equations here given for finding P, Q, 0 and are
  apparently complicated, but in point of fact they are not so,
  as will presently appear. The equations for determining Q
  and may be easily applied to determine the values of the
  unknown constants involved in them by comparison with ex
  perimental results, and appear to be well-adapted, not only
  for testing the truth of the theory here advanced, but also (sup
  posing that theory to turn out true) for deciding several im
 portant questions in the undulatory theory of light. We shall
 now show how the equations for determining Q and may be
 compared with experiment.

various metals, so that the light may be plane polarized after
two reflexions, or three reflexions, or four reflexions, &c.
In other words, he has determined a set of angles of incidence
which respectively make 2 = 180°, 3 = 180°, 4 = 180°, &c.
He has also determined the inclination of the plane of pola
rization of the twice-reflected ray to the plane of incidence, but
I  do not know whether he has done the same in the case of
the rays reflected three times, four times, &c.; there would be
of course no difficulty in observing the respective inclinations
of the planes of polarization of the rays which have been plane
polarized by three or more reflexions.      Supposing this done,
it is clear that we obtain a series of values of 4 which re
spectively make i = 90°, 1 = 60, i=45°; and at the same time
we determine the corresponding values of Q, for           we sup                                   (if

solutions thus obtained, we shall obtain real integrals                                                           of   the

fraction at the surface (supposed to be plane) of the transpa
rent substance to which the above equations apply, taking for
granted the results arrived at in the memoir (Cambridge
Transactions, vol. viii. p. 7) above-quoted, and assuming the
notation there employed (observing that n=k v=k'w').

 We    may now immediately find another set               of values of V, V,
 and V', by simply changing the sign of the V-1 in these
 formulae, which gives us

                     of Reflexion and Refraction.                  295

                               #
And superposing       these two sets     of values we find the follow
ing real values of V, V, and V', which satisfy the equations of
motion and connection, viz.
V = a cos(n t—k (p a       +s 2)},
V- – Pacos        (nt-k (pr—s 2)–0),

above-stated for vibrations      perpendicular    to the plane of inci

       A   portion of the water was concentrated by evaporation
   and divided into two parts; one of which, on being treated
   with fresh starch-paste and nitric acid, gave indication of
   iodine; the other part, when freed from iodine by nitric acid
   and aether, was mixed with a solution of chlorine and aether,
   which proved the existence of bromine. Nitrate of silver added
   to the mineral water gave a precipitate of chloride of silver,
   which became gray and afterwards purple, indicating organic
   matter, which was obviously demonstrated by the residue,
   after evaporating some of the water to dryness, becoming
   charred during ignition.          Acetate of lead gave a yellowish
   white precipitate, proving the absence of hydrosulphuric acid.
   Caustic soda disengaged ammonia in abundance, which was
   evinced even by carbonate of soda.
       The ingredients, which are present in very small quanti
   ties, were determined during the quantitative analysis, where
   a large volume of the water is evaporated, and consequently
   their detection rendered more easy.
       It may not be irrelevant to mention an excellent test for nitric
  acid, when accompanied either by iodine or bromine, or both,                                      its

This residue was dissolved in water and effervesced by the
addition of hydrochloric acid; it was evaporated, the residue
moistened with hydrochloric acid, and after a few hours again
dissolved in water, when a scarcely visible sediment separated.
The acid fluid was supersaturated with ammonia; oxalate of
ammonia gave no indication of lime, but phosphate of ammonia
gave a small precipitate of the ammonio-phosphate of mag
nesia; this was edulcorated upon a filter with dilute ammonia,
which prevents the re-solution of this salt, dried and ignited it
gave 0-0309 gr.” of phosphate of magnesia, equivalent to 0.011
magnesia.     Another mode of Berzelius, which gives likewise
very exact results, I will briefly notice. The concentrated
solution of the alkaline chlorides is to be evaporated to dryness
with oxide of mercury. The chloride of magnesium is changed
into magnesia, and chloride of mercury is produced, which
latter unites with the alkaline chlorides. The further process
is obvious+.

acid, and when boiling precipitated by chloride of barium.
 The sulphate of barytes weighed 7-201 grs., which amounts
upon 16 ozs. troy to 14.403 grs., equivalent to 4:950 grs. of sul
phuric acid. If we compare this result with the one obtained
 by the preliminary experiments at 1, it will be seen that it
 closely agrees.
    3. Nitric acid.—810 grs. of the fluid containing the so
 luble ingredients were very carefully neutralized by dilute
 sulphuric acid and macerated with a due proportion of sul
 phate of silver, in order to change the chlorides, iodides and
 bromides into sulphates f.       The fluid separated from the
 silver  precipitate was made alkaline by a little carbonate of
 soda, concentrated in a water-bath to a few ounces, and
 mixed in a tubulated retort with an adequate quantity of che
 mically pure sulphuric acid (previously boiled), more than
 sufficient to convert           in all
                           the ingredients into bisulphates. This
  mixture was heated           sand-bath and the vapours con

304            Mr. Schweitzer       on an Analysis       of the
of sulphuric acid appeared.         The fluid thus obtained was
evaporated in a water-bath nearly to dryness, and the re
sidue le<U+017F>t for twelve hours exposed to the atmospheric air, in
order to change the excess of hydrate of barytes into a car
bonate”. After the separation of the carbonate of barytes the
fluid was mixed with sulphuric acid, when 2:416 grs. of sul
phate of barytes were obtained, equivalent to 1-1220 gr. of
nitric acid.
    4. Chlorine.-One-twentieth part, equal to 405 grs. of the
fluid containing the soluble ingredients, was evaporated, and
the residue fused to destroy the organic matter, and again
dissolved.     The solution supersaturated with nitric acid was
precipitated by nitrate of silver. The precipitate was carefully
collected upon a filter and lixiviated, first with water slightly
acidulated with nitric acid, and afterwards with pure water.
The dried precipitate was heated nearly to the point of fusing
in a well-covered porcelain crucible, when 19:388 grs. of chlo
ride of silver were obtained, making for 16 ozs. troy of water
38.776 grs. ; but, as will be seen hereafter, 0.126 gr. of bro
mide of silver and 0.010 gr. of iodide of silver are to be de
ducted from the amount (38.776–0-136), leaving 38.640 grs.
of chloride of silver, equivalent to 9:533 grs. chlorine. If we
compare the amount of the silver precipitate with that obtained
from the preliminary experiment 2, we find a slight difference;
the latter giving from two experiments in 4 ounces 10:053
grs., whereas the former, calculated upon the same quan
tity of water, gives 9-694 grs. This discrepancy is accounted
for, from the organic matter in the original water being partly
thrown down with the silver precipitate.          It is therefore re
quisite to free the fluid from          organic matter before the
                                         its
amount of its chlorides can be ascertained. The interference
of  organic matter with correct results       evidenced
                                               is                 by

   a.  Four troy ounces       the fresh water gave with nitrate
                             of                                                  of
silver 10.053 grs.
   b.  Four troy ounces       the water evaporated with carbonate
                             of
of   soda and freed from the earthy carbonatest, gave with
nitrate   ofsilver 9,883 grs.
   c.  Four troy ounces       the water evaporated with carbonate
                             of
of soda and freed from the earthy carbonates, the filtered liquid
again evaporated, the residue fused and again dissolved, gave
with nitrate   of silver 9.694 grs.

               Bonnington   Water, near Leith, Scotland.                305
 gredients were evaporated to dryness and the residue boiled
 four times with an adequate proportion of alcohol.             [The re
 sidue after extraction showed no trace of iodine or bromine.]
 The alcoholic fluid was evaporated in a retort till an ounce
 remained, which, with the addition of a few grains of carbo
 nate of soda, was evaporated to dryness in a platina crucible,
 the residue gently heated to a low red heat for the purpose of
 destroying the organic matter, again dissolved in water and
 filtered. The alkaline fluid thus obtained was very carefully
 neutralized by dilute hydrochloric acid; it held now in solution
 the whole amount of iodine and bromine. In my account of the
 analysis of the sea-water in the British Channel”, I described
 my method for separating iodine from bromine and chlorine.
 This method, though accurate, is more tedious than the me
 thod of Lassaigne, which was published after I had written
 that analysis. Lassaigne recommends to precipitate the iodine
 by chloride of palladium, and of this excellent and approved
 test   I availed myself. Protochloride of palladium was added
 to the above fluid, which became at first turbid, but after the
 lapse of ten hours transparent, and a black-brown precipitate
 of protoiodide of palladium was obtained, which, when col
lected upon a filter, lixiviated and dried at 212°F., amounted
 to 0.046 gr., equivalent to 0.060 gr. of iodide of silver, making
for 16 troy ozs. of water 0:010 gr. of iodide of silver, equiva
 lent to 0-005 gr. of iodine.
     6. Bromine.—The fluid obtained after the separation of the
protoiodide of palladium was saturated with hydrosulphuric
acid gas to remove the excess of the palladium salt. Having
separated by filtration the sulphuret of palladium the fluid
was evaporated, the residue dissolved, the fluid filtered and
concentrated by evaporation; to this solution was added a
few drops of an ammoniacal solution of chloride of silver pre
pared thus: one part of a saturated solution of chloride of
silver in ammonia, mixed with one part of ammonia and one
part of water. A few drops of this mixture produced no tur
bidity in a saturated solution of chloride of sodium, but
would indicate a very minute quantity of bromine.                  I refer
for the further     proceeding   to my  analysis  of the sea-water in
the British Channel.         By this process 0-759 gr. of bromide
of silver were obtained, making for 16 ozs. troy 0-126 gr.,
equivalent to 0.053 gr. of bromine.
     7. Potassa,—810 grs. of the fluid containing the soluble
ingredients were neutralized by hydrochloric acid and the
sulphuric acid precipitated by chloride of barium.                   After
the    separation  of the sulphate  of barytes,  the fluid was mixed

306               Mr. Schweitzer on an Analysis         of the
with carbonate of ammonia and evaporated nearly to dryness,
to free it from the surplus of the barytes salt. Having sepa
rated the carbonate of barytes, the fluid thus obtained was
evaporated, and the residue heated to fusion in a well-covered
crucible. The alkaline chlorides were dissolved in water and
mixed with a surplus quantity of perchloride of platinum, and
evaporated in a temperature of 175°F. nearly to dryness; the
residue was macerated with spirits of wine (containing 60 per
cent. of alcohol) as long as anything dissolved, when potas
sio-chloride of platinum was left behind weighing 6'036 grs.,
equivalent to 1' 167 gr, potassa.
     8. Soda.-The usual way of ascertaining the amount of
soda is by an indirect method. This has no difficulties with
alkaline mineral waters; the amount of soda is obtained when
the whole amount of the ingredients found by analysis in the
fluid containing the soluble salts is deducted from the whole
weight of the alkaline salts obtained by evaporation; however,
this method cannot be applied where mineral waters have no
alkaline carbonates, and where carbonate of soda has been
added to the water, which by the presence of earthy chlorides,
&c. has been rarely changed into chloride of sodium.
     The following method I employed here for ascertaining the
soda by calculation —It is requisite to arrange the ingredients
established by analysis into binary combinations.                  Potassa,
as the     strongest  and   only  base”   ascertained,    is united to sul
phuric acid, and the surplus of the latter with the other elec
 tro-negative ingredients must therefore have been in combi
 nation with soda.         The nitric acid has existed as nitrate of
 soda; this acid, however, in conjunction with organic matter
 at the high temperature at which the soluble ingredients were
fused, has become decomposed, forming with soda carbonate
 of soda, an assumption established by facts.

of the earthy bases existing in the soluble salts, amounted to

of that quantity of carbonate of soda which was originally
added to the mineral water when evaporated.         If the soda

312            Mr. Schweitzer             on an Analysis     of the
tate was dried at 212° Fahr. and weighed 15:406 grs.          To
control the correctness of the weight, the precipitate and filter
were placed in a platina crucible, and ignited in the manner
described by H. Rose in his Analytical Manual, when 6:8138
grs. of platina were obtained, which corresponds with the
amount of platina derived by calculation from 15:406 grs.,
viz. 6-81.42 grs. The amount of ammonia calculated from
these data for 16 ounces is 3:03.3 grs.
   If we now arrange the electro-negative and electro-positive
ingredients, thus established, into binary combinations in the
ratio of their mutual affinities, it will be found that there is a
surplus of bases, one of which must obviously be united to
the organic matter; and I am inclined to think that a com
bination of ammonia and organic matter has existed. I regret
that the small quantity of water (12 wine bottles) obtained for
analysis from Scotland did not permit me to study the nature
of the organic matter, but there is no doubt that it belonged
to the group of decaying substances.         The few experiments
I was enabled to   perform  evidenced the absence of crenic and
apocrenic acid, namely, when the water was evaporated to
one-tenth of
                of its
                 volume, neutralized             no by

                                              doubt, particularly
since Mulder* and R. Herrman of Moscow have established
that some of the class of humus acids contain ammonia.                           If
mouldering wood, garden-earth, &c. are extracted            alcohol    by
and then with water, and the residue treated with alkalies,                      a
humus acid     obtained, which, besides carbon and the elements
               is

    1000 grs.-3-712 grs.--we find a deficiency of 0-153 gr., which
    belongs to the organic matter; yet it is to be observed, that the
    amount 3-712 cannot be very exact, as during evaporation a
    small proportion of ammonia must have been dissipated. To
    prove if the results of the analysis of the fixed bases are cor
    rect, they were computed to sulphates and compared with the
    result obtained by evaporating 1000 grs. of the water, igniting
    the residue to a red heat, and mixing it with a due quantity
    of sulphuric acid, and again igniting it until the surplus of
    sulphuric acid was dissipated, when it yielded 2:663 grs.
       Changing in this way the fixed ingredients into sulphates,

manganese and alumina might have lost during ignition a
small quantity of sulphuric acid.
   A few small flakes, which were found floating in the water,
and which were separated, remain finally to be noticed. These
flakes consisted chiefly of oxide of iron with a small propor
tion of organic matter.        The oxide of iron upon 16 ozs.
amounted to 0-384 gr., which had become separated (as           was                                  I
assured) from the water in the bottles, and must have existed
previously in the form of a proto-carbonate of iron, which
would be equivalent to the amount of 0:56175. On adding
this to the iron found in solution, 16 troy oz. of the water would

                               two couples are equal, their con
stituents are separately equal.” We are precluded from sup
posing the existence                      of

minds that the presence of traces of an albuminous substance
in the white matter of this serum was established; and we had
subsequently opportunities of obtaining this matter in larger
quantities, so as to confirm the previous experiments.
   These results led to a series of researches upon the effect
of food on animals, and also on man; from which it was clearly
demonstrated that the white colour of the serum in healthy ani
mals is dependent on the introduction of food into the system.
The detail of one or two experiments will place this conclusion
in a distinct point of view.                 It
                                was necessary for this purpose
to observe the characters of the serum of an individual who
had not tasted food for such a space of time that the effects of
the previous meal should have disappeared.       On the 10th of
 March 1844, from a stout young man, aged thirty, who had
tasted no food from the preceding evening at six o'clock p.m.,
two ounces of blood were taken at noon, or at an interval of eigh
teen hours after a meal.   The blood coagulated on standing
in the usual manner, and the supernatant serum was found to
possess a pale yellow colour, and to be perfectly clear and
limpid.
   After the abstraction of the blood, the individual dined

The white substance remaining on the filter presented charac

    The facts detailed having shown that there was a decided
distinction between the serum of a person previous to and after
taking food, it became an interesting point to pursue the in
 quiry, and to ascertain how long the milky aspect would con
 tinue in the blood.   Accordingly, at six o'clock p.m., or six
 hours after the meal, the individual was a third time bled to
 the extent of seven ounces.   The serum was in this case very
 milky, and threw up, on standing, a considerable white scum
 to the surface, which could be drawn up by a sucker and ex
 amined. On throwing the serum on a filter, a small portion
of white matter adhered to                        it,

326          Dr. R. D. Thomson        on the Digestion of
food alone. In general the species of food selected was por
ridge, or a mixture of oatmeal and water well-boiled.       In such
experiments as     I  have seen detailed, in reference to the free
acid of the stomach, there appears to have been too little at
tention paid to the possible results which might arise from a
difference in the nature of the food. Thus the products of
the digestion of starch we should naturally expect to be dif
ferent from those of the digestion of animal fibrin or albumen,
since we know that lactic acid can be produced by a modifi
cation of starch, although the same change does not attend
the decomposition of the animal substances enumerated. For
example, in the preparation of starch an acid liquor collects
on the surface of the vessels in which the starch is digested,
 and in the formation of sowans from oat-husks and water by
steeping, an acid liquor is developed,—in both instances a con
 sequence of the production of lactic acid at the expense of
 starch; while in the German dish, saurkraut, the same acid
 is generated by an analogous action.        I do not at present  in
 tend to discuss the nature of the acid which presents itself in
 the stomach during the digestion of animal food, but simply
 to detail the results of a series of experiments upon the changes
produced on vegetable food and starch during digestion.             I
 shall merely content myself with stating, that I have never
 found a volatile acid in the stomachs of animals which were
 digesting animal food alone, while in these cases I have inva
 riably found an acid to be present which was fixed at the tem
 perature of 212°, and even considerably higher.
     The nature of the Acid developed during the digestion of Starch.
  —It does not appear an invariable rule that an acid reaction
 should always characterize the liquid present in the stomach
 during digestion, as appears from the following experiment.
 On the 11th of July 1844, the different stomachs of a sheep
 killed twenty-four hours after partaking of grass, contained
 between two and three pounds of finely-divided green matter
 exhibiting a pulpy consistence, but being entirely destitute of
 either an acid or alkaline reaction.       The pulpy masses were
 tested in each of the stomachs with the same negative result,
 and they were afterwards mixed together, diluted with distilled
water and filtered, but still without producing any effect on
 litmus paper.     Experience teaches us, that to determine the
 presence of a volatile acid in the stomach, great care must be
 taken in reference to the mode in which the distillation is per
 formed, since if the heat of an open fire is applied to the
 retort, an indication of the presence of hydrochloric acid will
 be found in the liquid contained in the receiver by the addi
 tion of nitrate of silver.      The following experiment affords

                Vegetable Albumen,     Fat and Starch.             327
evidence in favour of this position, and it might be strength
ened, if necessary, by the results obtained by other experi
menters. The contents of the stomach of a dog which had
been fed on porridge made of oatmeal and water, and which
afforded an acid reaction with litmus paper, were mixed with
distilled water and filtered.      On exposing the distilled liquor
to the heat of an    open  fire in a retort, a fluid passed over pos
sessing an acid reaction, and becoming opalescent on the ad
dition of a solution of nitrate of silver, and without disappear
ance in contact with nitric acid; a result plainly indicative of
the presence of chlorine in some form in the liquor of the re
ceiver, but, as appeared by the subsequent inquiries, to be ex
plained by the fact that muriate of ammonia must have been
carried over by the vapour of water in consequence of the
excess   of heat.
    To determine in a satisfactory    manner therefore the presence
of a volatile  acid,  it is necessary to distil the fluid contents of
the stomach in a water-bath.         With this consideration in view
the  following    experiment    was made.      June 1844, a pig was
fed on   potatoes   and   greens,  and was killed in half an hour
after the food was swallowed.          The stomach was slit open,
and as much of the fluid contents as possible were poured off;
the solid contents were then digested in cold distilled water.
 Both fluids were filtered and mixed, each previous to being
united being found to exhibit an acid reaction with litmus          in
fusion. To ascertain whether the statement made by a French
physiologist (Blondlot) is correct, viz. that the acid of the
stomach cannot be saturated with chalk, a quantity of pure
carbonate of lime was prepared by dissolving Irish limestone
in hydrochloric acid, precipitating a small portion of phosphate
of lime and iron which it contains with caustic ammonia, and
then throwing down the lime with carbonate of ammonia, col
lecting the precipitate on a filter, washing it well with distilled
water, and heating it to redness in a platinum crucible.           An
excess of this chalk was then added to the filtered fluid of the
stomach, and the mixture was allowed to remain for twenty
four hours, disturbed only by frequent agitation.          It was then .
filtered, and found to have been completely neutralized.           Ha
ving often repeated this experiment on various specimens of
gastric fluid with the same effect, I can only account for the
different result obtained by Blondlot, by supposing that he had
attempted to complete his neutralization of the fluid while it
was in a heated state, and that possibly, if acetic or lactic acids
were present, these acids might resist neutralization at an
elevated temperature, since it has been found by manufac
turers of pyroligneous acid that they cannot succeed in form

building.    The quantity was such as to form a uniform layer
of about two inches above the rods and to fill up the inter
spaces between them. The whole was then left to acquire the
requisite degree of solidity.     The motion was communicated
by applying a force to the central rods alone, which, with the
superincumbent mortar adhering to them, were thus made to
move, while the lateral rods and mortar remained at rest. In
this manner a straight transversal line drawn on the surface
      &
of the mortar became a loop, the form of which could be regu
lated at pleasure, and the mass was brought into a state of
constraint exactly similar to that superinduced in a glacier by
the excess of its central over its lateral motion. TÉ. results

when such a motion had been communicated to its central

 This is exactly accordant with    my theoretical deduction for the
 case in which there is neither longitudinal nortransversal exten
 sion or compression (Second Letter, art. 20, p. 161), as was the
 case in the experiment; for, from the manner in which the mo
 tion was communicated, there could be no longitudinal exten
 sion or compression, and transversal compression could only
 arise from the relative motion of the centre, and could there
 fore only be of the second order of small quantities, the mo
 tion itself being considered a small quantity of the first order.
 The incipient fissures were not curved but straight, as they
 ought to be, according to theory, under the above conditions.

   The experiment was also made somewhat differently, by
placing the central rods so that they reached only half the
length of the trough.  When these rods were made to move
as before, with the mass immediately superincumbent                  upon
them, that portion along the middle of the trough under which
the rods did not pass was extended, and the curved fissures
across the whole surface were there produced in a manner ex
actly accordant with theory.
   Another system of lines also resulted from the motion com
municated to the mass.           A great number of extremely small
ridges forming discontinuous lines, as represented in the pre
ceding diagram, appeared on the surface, their directions being
at right angles to the lines of fissure. They were manifestly
due to the compression in directions at right angles to them,
these directions being in fact the directions of maximum press
ure, as determined by theory. That such was the case was
made further evident by continuing the motion of the central
portion, and watching the gradual development and increased
number of these lines. They were best developed when the
surface of the mass had become slightly crisped before the mo
tion was given to              it.

                                                      Forbes,    according
to  which the direction of the artificial fissure above described

   Mr. Hopkins    on the Mechanism   of Glacial Motion. IV.     381
is that in which the greatest sliding motion ought to take
place.
     The lines exhibited on Prof. Forbes's models of plaster of
Paris, and which have been considered by him as represen
tatives of the veined structure in glaciers, are to be referred,
I   have no doubt, to the same cause as the linear ridges de
scribed in my experiment.      In fact, if it were possible to con
tinue the central motion in    my   experiments, to the same ex
tent as in the more fluid mass used in the experiments of Prof.
 Forbes, the two sets of lines in these cases respectively would
assume exactly similar positions.      I have shown experiment
 ally that the lines in my experiments were not associated with
 any discontinuity of the mass, such as that which Prof. Forbes
 has considered to be indicated by the corresponding lines in
 his models.     How such indication is afforded by the-    lines in
 question,   I do not in any degree understand.
     When the central motion was continued the fissures were
 necessarily brought more nearly to perpendicularity with the
 axis; but when their obliquity to their original position, i. e. to
 the line of maximum pressure, became considerable, they began
 to close. (Second Letter, art. 24, p. 163.).    We thus account
 for the fact, that transverse fissures never remain open long
 enough to acquire a position in which their convexity would
 be turned towards the lower extremity of the glacier, a posi
 tion which they must necessarily assume by the more rapid
 motion of the centre, unless there were some cause originating
 in that motion constantly tending to obliterate them.
     When the central motion was continued long enough, the
 fissures along the flanks became more irregular and ran into
 each other, after which the central portion moved nearly as a
 continuous mass, sliding past the narrow lateral portions, from
  which it was severed on either side by the lateral fissures
 running into each other as just described.
     Another effect of the pressure superinduced by the motion
  of the central portion is not undeserving of notice. . When
  the mass projected beyond the lower end of the trough, it was
  pushed outwards at the sides by the pressure acting trans
  versely, so that by this action and the dislocation along the
  flank of the mass, the lateral portions turned round the ex
  tremities of the trough almost as completely as if the mass
  had been fluid. This explains the expansion of glaciers in
  expanding valleys without the hypothesis of fluidity. (Second
   Letter, art. 23, p. 163.)
      II. When the experiment was made within an hour or two
   after the layer of mortar had been prepared, and when the
   mortar was comparatively soft, parallel lines of dislocation

332       Mr. Hopkins   on the Mechanism    of Glacial Motion. IV.
 appeared on each side of the central portion, but in a position
 entirely different from those above-described.          When first
 visible their common direction made an angle of 15° or 16°
 with the axis of the trough, whereas the systems of lines when
 the mass was more compact, were at an angle of 45° with the
 axis. To ascertain whether there was any tendency in the
 particles on opposite sides of one of these new lines of disloca
 tion to slide past each other, I proceeded as in the former
 case, drawing a short line on the surface perpendicular to one
 of the dislocations, and continuing the central motion. The
 short line drawn on the surface immediately became a broken
 line at the point of intersection, proving the existence, in this
 case, of the sliding motion, of which it will be recollected there
 was no indication whatever in the experiment previously de
 scribed, when the mass was more compact.
    The lines now spoken of were not visible till the curvature
 of the transverse loop had become much greater than in the
preceding case.        On calculating the directions in which the
 tangential action was a maximum, by the construction pre
viously given (Second Letter, art. 17), it appeared that those
directions made an angle with the axis about half as great as
that made by the lines of dislocation, when those lines first
showed themselves.        Now in supposing, as I have in my pre
vious    letters, that the lines of greatest tangential action are
those   along   which separation planes would be formed, if formed
at all, I have tacitly assumed the resistance afforded by the
mass to their formation to be the same in all directions.          It
would seem       highly probable,    however, that, catteris paribus,
this resistance would be greatest in directions perpendicular
to the lines of greatest pressure, in which case dislocations
would take place in directions deviating less than the directions
of greatest tangential action from the lines of maximum press
ure. Such was the case in the experiments just described.
The difference of position in the systems of dislocations, the
mass being compact in one case and soft in the other, was
owing,      Iconceive, to the mass yielding most easily in the
former case to the direct normal tension, and in the latter case
to the tangential action. It seems probable that such would
be the case; and, in fact, in those experiments in which the
mass was softest, I doubt whether it was ever brought into a
state of tension at all, on account of        semifluidity,
                                           all its
                                                           in  which
                             no
                             tendency           form open fissures,
case there would    of be             at             to
as   inthe first set    experiments, while the formation    of sepa
ration planes would         be
                            facilitated.

or the lines along which the particles moved past each other;
the finer lines those of greatest tangential action, and the dot
ted lines those of maximum tension, or those along which the
drag takes place towards the middle of the glacier.       Conse
quently these latter lines are those along which, according to
Prof. Forbes's views, the sliding of one particle past another
ought to have taken place. The lines on one longitudinal
half only of the mass are represented in the diagram.

 334          Mr. Hopkins's Reply        to  Dr. Whewell's
 ing as the mass is semifluid, or possesses at least a certain
 degree of solidity.      The curves of dislocation have, in both
 cases, their convexity turned in the same direction, but in the
 former case the loop is much more elongated than in the lat
 ter. In the more elongated curves the tangent at a point near
 the side will be inclined to the axis at an angle of about 15°,
 whereas in the other curves the corresponding angle will be
at least 45°. Now it is unquestionable that this last system of
 dislocations affords the accurate type of the transverse fissures
of a glacier; but what glacial phaenomena correspond to the
other system 2 I challenge any one to point out in a canal
shaped glacier transverse fissures approximating to the elon
gated loops of that system; nor will the lines of structure
suffice.    There are, in fact, no phaenomena hitherto observed
which represent the loops in question, and hence                I maintain
that  glacial  motion cannot be      correctly represented    by  that of a
semifluid mass.
      he experimental results      I  have now described are so clear
and determinate, and appear to me to corroborate so distinctly
the theoretical results      I had previously obtained, that        I trust
I  may be allowed to add this account of them to my previous
communications, as the conclusion of the exposition of my
views respecting the mechanism of glacial motion.

      GENTLEMEN,
                 completed the exposition of my own views re
HAVING   specting the motion of glaciers, I shall now beg permis
sion to offer a few remarks in reply to the letters addressed to
you by Dr. Whewell on the same subject.
    With respect to the definitions which your correspondent
has given ºsuch terms as solidity, flewibility, &c., every one,
I  apprehend, will agree with him, and in so doing must allow
the justice of the observation at the close of my first letter,
which appears to have called forth these definitions, viz. that
Prof. Forbes had used such terms too indiscriminately.                  He
has spoken of having proved the plasticity of glacial ice by
observations which only proved a small degree of flexibility*,

volving the hypothesis of the rigidity of glacial ice+. I have
protested against his charging that theory with any such phy
sical absurdity.    Whether solidity as a relative term may or
may not with propriety be opposed to rigidity as an absolute
one, is a question not involved in anything            have advanced.             I

dity; but to assert that he propounded a theory which tacitly
involves his attributing to glacial ice either the property of
rigidity, or that of solidity in a degree which would render
the motion of a glacier a manifest impossibility under existing
conditions, would be a most unjustifiable reflection on the sci
entific character of that distinguished traveller.
   The terms semifluid, plastic and solid are doubtless compa
rative terms; but we are not justified in using them without
discrimination because the properties denoted by them gra
duate into each other by insensible degrees.           Red and green
are  equally  comparative    terms;    but no one thinks of calling
a green field red, or a common brick wall green, because the
colours of the spectrum graduate into each other. To call a
hard crystalline substance, like glacial ice, semifluid or viscous

   Dr. Whewell has pointed out the phaenomena which would
 be presented          by

which would characterize              viscous   a    plastic one.  or He states
that,    in the first case, “the straight lines originally trans

The whole mass will                   be

 which is possible for the texture.      If in any part the texture
   ives way,  we shall have fissures    nearly   perpendicular to the
 transverse curves. On this     supposition   of a flexible glacier, we
 have (1) original transverse straight lines drawn into curves of
 limited flewure; (2) the substance in a state of distortion, from
 which hand specimens would instantly recover; (3) a homoge
neous texture of such specimens.”        Again, it is stated that, on
the supposition of the glacier being viscous or plastic, filaments
will slide past each other in lines directed towards the middle,
and that the mass will thus be separated according to such
lines. . Also, “if the texture of the substance yield to the ten
sion which tends to separate it directly, we shall have fissures
in directions perpendicular to the directions just described ”
(those in which the particles slide past each other). It is then
stated, that we should have “(1) original transverse straight
lines drawn into curves of unlimited flexure; (2) the texture
of the substance in a state of equilibrium, so that hand speci
mens have no distortion to recover from ; (3) a banded texture,
the bands being traces of parallel fissures.”
    It will be seen at once that these statements, made as though
they contained only recognised facts or incontrovertible con
clusions, do really contain most of the controverted points in
the subject. In the first place it is stated, on the supposition of
glacial ice being flexible, that fissures would be formed nearly
perpendicular to the transverse curves above mentioned.              In
my Second Letter (arts. 4, 7, and 8, p. 148, &c.)           have given              I
three different proofs that such will not be the case.            I can
only challenge the refutation of any one of them. It is rightly
asserted that, previous to fracture, the curves would be of                                                li
mited flewure; but it is not correct that hand specimens would
instantly recover from their state of distortion, for that would
require the mass to be perfectly elastic, a property which it
would be absurd to attribute to              The assertion (3) that

338.          Mr. Hopkins's Reply         to  Dr. Whewell's
If not,   by what process of exhaustion has he proved that the
alternation of bands of transparent and opake ice can arise
only from planes of separation? Again, to explain the forma
 tion of such planes, it is asserted, that, because there will be a
 drag towards the middle, it will be in that direction that fila
 ments of the mass will slide past each other.             But I maintain
 that the fact of the drag being a maximum in that direction
 is the very reason why the filaments in that same direction
 will not slide past each other. A filament tends to slide past
 a contiguous one, not because both are dragged, but because
 they are dragged unequally; whereas, in the direction in which
 the drag is greatest, the filaments are equally dragged, simply
 because the drag in that direction is a maximum. Dr. Whewell
 appears in the first instance to have objected to Prof. Forbes's
 mechanical theory of the laminar structure, asserting that the
 planes of separation ought to be parallel to the sides of the
 glacier”. This was not accurate, except in the particular case
 of the absence of transversal pressure (Second Letter, art. 25,
 p. 165), but was still the kind of approximation to the truth
 which a first and general view of the problem was almost sure to
 suggest. What may have been the “simple mechanical views”
 which led him afterwards to adopt the reasoning of Professor
 Forbes, I am unable to comprehend.                  It would have been
 much more satisfactory if he had stated what those simple
 views are; and it would have been better, if he would persuade
 others to adopt them, that he should have given some proof
 of the fallacy of my investigations on this point, since those
 investigations (which must have been before him when he wrote
 his second letter) lead to results so entirely at variance with
 the conclusions he has adopted. This is what Dr. Whewell or
 some other advocate of Prof. Forbes’s theory must do, or that
 theory, as affording a mechanical explanation of the banded
structure, must necessarily fall. It cannot stand unless support
ed by more conclusive reasoning than that on which alone it has
 hitherto been made to rest. Such cases as that appealed to by
 Prof. Forbes in the last Number of your Magazine(p.206) may
afford analogies which may be delusive, or may be ultimately
useful in guiding us to the true mechanical solution of the
problem before us; but such cases differ too widely from that
of a glacier to afford anything more than analogies, even if
the problem which each particular case presents were com
pletely solved; and assuredly, an appeal to such cases can
tral part and the exterior ring being always opake. These successive rings
(with the exception of their circular form) exactly resembled the alternate
opake and transparent bands in glacial ice.        [On this subject, see Mr.
Darwin's remarks   quoted  in p. 354 of the  present number.—Édir.]

 erroneous.
    Again, with respect to a plastic or viscous mass, it is asserted
 that the curves would be of unlimited flexure.                  This would
doubtless be true with a sufficient degree of plasticity, but I
 am perfectly satisfied that there is no great flexure without
 innumerable fractures in any actual glacier.              Along the flanks
there are    invariably   numerous      dislocations,    and in those parts
 the relative motions of different points do not take place merely
by an extension of the mass, but undoubtedly by the sliding
also of one mass past another; and the central portion, though
generally less dislocated than the flanks, is still broken into
thousands of fragments at particular points of                     course,                       its                   so

340                  Mr. Hopkins's          Reply to   Dr. Whewell's
 nature of the subject, would prescribe to us in discussions of
 this kind. Dr. Whewell has thought proper to reply to my
 former observations on the secular character of the plasticity
 of glacial ice by a sarcasm.         I think the circumstance deser
 ving of a moment's notice only for the purpose of deprecating
 any attempt to give a tone to the present controversy incon
 sistent with the character of a scientific discussion, and with
 that respect which the parties engaged in it have a right to
 claim from each other, and which, I have been willing to
 hope, could not be diminished by a mere difference of opinion
 on a question of physical science.
     One or two other points in Dr. Whewell's letters I would
 briefly notice.      He has remarked that it would be an unworthy
 return to Prof. Forbes if we should write on glacial theories
 as if we had derived nothing from him with respect to the
 plasticity of glacial ice.      It might also be added, that it would
 be equally wrong to write as if we had derived nothing on
 other points from anybody else.            But there was no occasion,
 in  my   opinion,    for the observation.      Everyone recognises the
 high merits of Prof. Forbes as an observer of glacial phaeno
 mena; as a theorist, his claims still remain to be substantiated.
 As far as the plasticity of glacier ice shall hereafter be proved
 to be one of the effective causes of the motion of glaciers, di
                                                                                               .
 rectly or indirectly, so far will those claims be at once allowed.
 The way to establish them is to establish his theory.
     Again, Dr. Whewell observes that the question of the state
 of the lower surface of a glacier, “though not unimportant,
 offers nothing of novelty; the glacier slides by the constant
 melting of          its
                    lower surface,                                 the sub          of

jacent soil. This was distinctly taught              De Saussure.” And
    may       added, almost
               be                   distinctly denied
                                           as                            by

                              in                  Mr. Darwin unites                          to  a
bold facility  of comprehending the mutual relations           the greater   of
features exhibited       by
                        the physical phaenomena which have come under
his observation,    a happy and perspicacious power          recognizing   of                    a
peculiar order   ofgeological dynamic agents, which, though certainly

 Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage        of the Beagle. 343
not the first to notice—for many of them are matters of common and
daily observation—he has yet been the first to develope in the before
unsuspected greatness of their continual operation, and the first broad
ly to exhibit as causes—as vera, causae—of geological phaenomena.
In his works, the agency of the winds, of the chemical elements dis
solved in the waves which they impel, of the dust which they raise
and diffuse, of the depositions of rivers on the rocks over which they
flow, of the matter resulting from the action of the elements on col
lections of animal excretions and exuviae, of the earth-worm as a la
bourer in geological dynamics, of the compound-polyp which, sepa
rating lime from sea-water, secretes its carbonate in the form of coral,
have been developed and portrayed for the first time in their ge
nuine tenour and importance. With respect to coral reefs and islands,
much, indeed, had previously been effected, in part by English na
turalists, in part by foreign voyagers; but the true interpretation, we
conceive, of many of their observations, has been first given by Mr.
Darwin, together with numerous other facts which belong exclusively
to himself.
   In these geological observations on the volcanic islands visited du
ring the voyage of the Beagle, we have the effects of both the qualities
of facile and accurate induction we have just attributed to their author.
Unlike some of his former works, they are not adapted to gratify the
general reader, or even to please the popular scientist, but they will
supply inestimable materials for the elucidation of volcanic geology,
in the hands of the profound investigator of nature, to whom they
will also be suggestive of some of the deepest questions of geologic -
causation.
   We have not before had a suitable opportunity of acknowledging
as it deserves the value of Mr. Darwin's contributions to science, and
were unwilling to omit such an acknowledgement when directing our
readers’ attention to a work in which some of them are recorded. We
will now proceed to a brief analytical view of these “Observations,”
and to extract from them certain portions, which we deem peculiarly
characteristic of their author's modes of thought and description.
   The title of the work states explicitly its contents.      The first
 130 pages relate almost exclusively to the volcanic islands and their
constitution, under the heads of St. Jago, in the Cape de Verde      Ar
chipelago, Fernando Noronha, Terceira, Tahiti, Mauritius, Ascension,
St. Helena, the Galapagos Archipelago, Trachyte and Basalt, Dis
tribution of Volcanic Isles. The remainder of the volume consists of
observations chiefly on the geology of New South Wales, Van
Diemen's Land, New Zealand, King George's Sound, and the Cape
of Good Hope; and an appendix contains descriptions of fossil
shells from a tertiary deposit at St. Jago, of extinct land-shells from
St. Helena, and of shells from the palaeozoic formation of Van Die
men's Land,   all   by Mr. G.   B.Sowerby; together with descriptions
of  fossil corals from the same formation    by Mr. Lonsdale, who, we
are thus happy   to  see, continues  toaid the geologist byhis valuable
labours in   invertebral palaeontology.

  Wolcanic Islands visited during the Voyage            of the Beagle. 345
enamel. Several other varieties are chiefly characterized, by containing    in
numerable threads of dark-green serpentine, and by having calcareous mat
ter in their interstices.   These rocks have an obscure, concretionary struc
ture, and are full of variously-coloured angular pseudo-fragments.       These
angular pseudo-fragments consist of the first-described dark green rock, of
a brown softer kind, of serpentine, and of a yellowish harsh stone, which,
perhaps, is related to serpentine rock.    There are other vesicular, calcareo
ferruginous soft stones. There is no distinct stratification, but parts are
imperfectly laminated; and the whole abounds with innumerable veins,
and vein-like masses, both small and large.    Of these vein-like masses, some
calcareous ones, which contain minute fragments of shells, are clearly of
subsequent origin to the others.
  “A    glossy incrustation.—Extensive portions of these rocks are coated by
a layer of a glossy polished substance, with a pearly lustre and of a grayish
white colour; it follows all the inequalities of the surface, to which it is
firmly attached.     When examined with a lens, it is found to consist of nu
merous exceedingly thin layers, their aggregate thickness being about the
tenth of an inch.     It is considerably harder than calcareous spar, but can
be scratched with a knife; under the blow-pipe it scales off, decrepitates,
slightly blackens, emits a fetid odour, and becomes strongly alkaline: it
does not effervesce in acids”.     I presume this substance has been deposited
by water draining from the birds’ dung, with which the rocks are covered.
At Ascension, near a cavity in the rocks, which was filled with a laminated
mass of infiltrated birds' dung, I found some irregularly-formed, stalacti
tical masses of apparently the same nature. These masses when broken
had an earthy texture, but on their outsides, and especially at their extre
mities, they were formed of a pearly substance, generally in little globules,
like the enamel of teeth, but more translucent, and so hard as just to scratch
plate-glass. This substance slightly blackens under the blow-pipe, emits a
bad smell, then becomes quite white, swelling a little, and fuses into a dull
white enamel ; it does not become alkaline; nor does it effervesce in acids.
The whole mass had a collapsed appearance, as if in the formation of the
hard glossy crust, the whole had shrunk much.         At the Abrolhos Islands,
on the coast of   Brazil,                                      I
                          where also there is much birds dung, found a great
quantity of a brown, arborescent substance adhering to some trap-rock. In
its arborescent form, this substance singularly resembles some of the
branched species of Nullipora.        Under the blow-pipe, it behaves like the
specimens from Ascension; but it is less hard and glossy, and the surface
has not the shrunk appearance.”
   In the third chapter, allotted to Ascension, we have an interesting
notice of the volcanic bombs which are so numerous in that island,
and which are probably connected in their origin with the explosions
of aeriform matter that have covered the flanks of Green Mountain
and the surrounding country with a mass some hundred feet in thick

rise to a small dripping spring, first discovered by Dampier.     It is the only

   “The whole interior is coarsely cellular; the cells averaging in diameter
 about the tenth of an inch; but nearer the outside they gradually decrease
 in size. This part is succeeded by a well-defined shell of compact lava,
having a nearly uniform thickness of about the third of an inch; and the
shell is overlaid by a somewhat thicker coating of finely cellular lava (the
cells varying from the fiftieth to the hundredth of an inch in diameter),
which forms the external surface: the line separating the shell of compact
lava from the outer scoriaceous crust is distinctly defined.   This structure
is very simply explained, if we suppose a mass of viscid scoriaceous matter                                º
to be projected with a rapid, rotatory motion through the air; for whilst the
external crust, from cooling, became solidified (in the state we now see it),
the centrifugal force, by relieving the pressure in the interior parts of the
bomb, would allow the heated vapours to expand their cells; but these
being driven by the same force against the already-hardened crust, would

become, the nearer they were to this part, smaller and smaller or less ex
          until they became packed into a solid, concentric shell. As we
  now that chips from a grindstone" can be flirted off, when made to revolve
with sufficient velocity, we need not doubt that the centrifugal force would
have power to modify the structure of a softened bomb, in the manner here
supposed.     Geologists have remarked, that the external form of a bomb at
once bespeaks the history of                     its
                                 aérial course, and we now see that the                               in
                can speak, with almost equal plainness,     rotatory move         of   its

  aragraph.      The jasper is of an ochre-yellow or red colour; it occurs in
 arge irregular masses, and sometimes in veins, both in the altered trachyte
and in an associated mass of scoriaceous basalt. The cells of the scoria
ceous basalt are lined or filled with fine, concentric layers of chalcedony,
coated and studded with bright-red oxide of iron.              In this rock, especially
in the rather more compact parts, irregular angular patches of the red jas
per are included, the edges of which insensibly blend into the surrounding
mass; other patches occur having an intermediate character between per
fect jasper and the ferruginous, decomposed basaltic base. In these patches,
and likewise in the large vein-like masses of jasper, there occur little
rounded cavities, of exactly the same size and form with the air-cells, which
in the scoriaceous basalt are filled and lined with layers of chalcedony.

and as these hills, according to the view above given, consist of trachyte
softened and altered in situ, the presence of free silica in this case may be
added as one more instance to the list.”
     Mr. Darwin truly      observes, as above, that we are ignorant of the
 means   by  which,    in the silicification of wood, every atom of wood,
 whilst in a  perfect    state, is removed and replaced by atoms of silica.
 The recent    discovery      by Ebelmen, as noticed in our last Volume,
 p. 397, of the production of silicic aethers, by the substitution of si
 lica in equivalent proportions for the water which in alcohol is united
 to the oxide of a certain hydro-carbon, induces us to offer a sugges
 tion on this subject. Hydro-carbons, combinations of hydrogen and
 carbon, in various proportions, are the results, as Liebig has shown
 by a comprehensive induction from facts previously investigated by
 other chemists, of eremacausis, and of other changes, which either
spontaneously occur or are readily induced, in natural operations, in
 ligneous and other vegetable matter, and some of them, as the tur
pentines, are the actual products of vegetable life. Now silicic aether,
it is found, is soluble in all proportions, in alcohol and aether, which
involves the fact of the practical indefinite solubility of silica in the
oride and the hydrated oride of that peculiar hydro-carbon which has
 been called by modern chemists, ethyl.          But if these products of vege
table matter have this kind of loose          affinity  for silica, causing them
 thus to unite with it in     large  proportions,  from which it is again rea
 dily separable, is it not in the highest degree probable that other
 (natural) products of vegetation, other hydro-carbons or their oxides,
may have a similar power of dissolving silica, readily to part with                                   it.

it appears always to be of a pale pearly-gray colour, whereas, in other
situations, it has a dark gray or even a jet-black colour.     This           in
duces the author to suppose
“that an abundance of light is necessary to the development of the dark
colour, in the same manner as seems to be the case with the upper and ex
posed surfaces of the shells of living mollusca, which are always dark, com
pared with their under surfaces and with the parts habitually covered by
the mantle of the animal.    In this circumstance,—in the immediate loss of
colour and in the odour emitted under the blow-pipe,         in the degree of
hardness and translucency of the edges, and in the beautiful polish of the
surface, rivalling when in a fresh state that of the finest Oliva, there is a
striking analogy between this inorganic incrustation and the shells of living
molluscous animals".    This appears to me to be an interesting physiolo
gical fact.”
    In continuation of the geological history of Ascension are described
some singular laminated beds, alternating with and passing into ob
sidian. These consist,-1, of a pale gray, irregularly and coarsely la
minated harsh-feeling rock, resembling clay-slate which has been in
contact with a trap-dike, and easily fusing, like the following varieties,
into a pale glass; 2, a bluish-gray or pale brown, compact, heavy,
apparently homogeneous stone, in which, however, under a lens, a
crystalline fracture and even separate minerals can be observed; 3,
a stone resembling the last, but streaked with crystalline white hairs
of quartz and green transparent needles of diopside; 4, a compact
crystalline rock banded with innumerable layers seeming to be com
posed chiefly of felspar, and containing numerous perfect crystals of
glassy felspar placed lengthways, minute black specks of hornblende
or augite, and red specks of oxide of iron ; 5, a compact heavy rock,
not laminated, with an irregular, angular, highly crystalline fracture,
abounding with distinct crystals of glassy felspar, and having the
crystalline felspathic base mottled with a black mineral, and the en
tire rock strikingly resembling, in aspect, a primitive greenstone.
   We have been thus particular in describing after our author the
characters of these rocks, because the knowledge of those characters
is essential to the accurate comprehension of the history of their pas
sage into obsidian, which, with           its
                                         accompaniments, we deem one           of

354          Notices respecting       New       Books:–Darwin         on the
structure.    In the same specimen, also, sphaerulites differing slightly in co
lour and in structure occur imbedded close together.         Considering these
                      º
facts, it is some confirmation of the view above given of the concretionary
origin of the obsidian and natural sphaerulites, to find that M. Dartigues",
in his curious          on this subject, attributes the production of sphaeru
 lites in glass to the different ingredients obeying their own laws of attrac
 tion and becoming aggregated. He is led to believe that this takes place,
 from the difficulty in remelting sphaerulitic glass, without the whole be first
 thoroughly pounded and mixed together; and likewise from the fact, that
 the change takes place most readily in glass composed of many ingredients.
 In confirmation of M. Dartigues’ view, I may remark, that M. Fleuriau de
  Bellevue   t found that the sphaerulitic portions of devitrified glass were
 acted on both by nitric acid and under the blow-pipe, in a different manner
 from the compact paste in which they were imbedded.”
   The author next points out how closely the description of the ob
sidian rocks of Hungary given by Beudant, that by Humboldt of
the same formation in Mexico and Peru, and likewise the descrip
tions given by Scrope, Dolomieu, and D’Aubuisson, of the trachytic
regions in the Italian Islands, agree with his own observations at
Ascension.    Many passages, he remarks, might have been transferred
without alteration from the works of those authors, and would have
been applicable to this island.   He then proceeds to investigate the
lamination of volcanic rocks of the trachytic series, and after referring
to the frequently zoned structure of obsidian itself, and to the obser
vations of the geologists named above, and the theoretical views on
the subject enunciated by some of them, he finds, guided by Pro
fessor Forbes's clear description of the zoned structure of glacier ice,
that
“far    the most probable explanation of the laminated structure of these
felspathic rocks appears to be, that they have been stretched whilst slowly
flowing onwards in a pasty condition f, in precisely the same manner as
Professor Forbes believes that the ice of moving glaciers is stretched and
fissured.    In both cases, the zones may be compared to those in the finest
agates; in both, they extend in the direction in which the mass has flowed,
 and those exposed on the surface are generally vertical : in the ice, the
porous laminae are rendered distinct by the subsequent congelation of in
 filtrated water, in the stony felspathic lavas, by subsequent crystalline and
 concretionary action.    The fragment of glassy obsidian in Mr. Stokes’ col
lection, which is zoned with minute air-cells, must strikingly resemble,
judging from Professor Forbes' descriptions, a fragment of the zoned ice;

By J. R. Hind, Esq.
  “These elliptical elements of the new comet discovered at Rome
on August 22, have been computed from an observation made at
Cambridge on September 15, one at Greenwich on October 3, and
a third at Mr. Bishop's Observatory, in the Regent's Park, on Oc
tober 22. The last position was obtained by comparison of the
comet with a star in Prof. Santini's Catalogue, employing a wire
micrometer.    The observations were corrected for aberration and
parallax, and the resulting elements are as follows:—

                                RECENT COMETs,
    HE    Great Comet of 1845, the discovery of which was announced
      last month, has since been observed in England; though, owing
to its distance from the earth, it had become so faint an object as to es
cape any but a practised eye, aided by the most powerful instruments.
Observations made at Ceylon, Bombay, Madras, and other places in
the east, have already been received in this country: astronomers are
yet expecting the arrival of those made at the Cape of Good Hope,
which will doubtlessly furnish data for the satisfactory determination
of the elements of its orbit.
   A second telescopic comet was discovered at the Observatory of
the Collegio Romano, on the evening of February 25. The posi
tions given by Prof. De Vico are as follows:—

  The author gives this name to an acid product analogous to hu
mus, which is produced by the decomposition of narcotina by heat.
  When narcotina is heated by an oil-bath in a platina vessel, to
some degrees above its melting-point, it begins to become coloured,
and eventually assumes a deep reddish-brown; at about 428° it sud
denly swells and disengages a very large quantity of ammoniacal gas,
nearly pure.
   The residue solidifies into a very spongy mass, which, after pow
dering, is nearly of a pure brown colour; it is essentially composed
of humopinic acid.
   In order to purify     it,
                          the powder must    digested  behydrochloric

acquires a deep yellowish-red colour; this solution is to be supersa
turated with hydrochloric acid, which precipitates the humopinic
acid, resembling in appearance hydrated peroxide of iron. It is to
be washed in alcohol, which leaves a light residue of a dull substance.
   The alcoholic solution, when dropped gradually into water, forms
with it an emulsion of a deep peach-red colour.
   By evaporating the alcohol, the humopinic acid remains in the
state of a deep brown mass.
   The properties of humopinic acid are, that it is an amorphous
substance of a deep brown colour. It melts when heated, and burns                                        º
with flame, and emits an odour of narcotina. It is insoluble in weak                                 .
acids and in water; the alcoholic solution is of a deep yellowish-red
colour. The alkalies dissolve     forming      it,

posed narcotina, the solution is to be heated to ebullition, and after
wards saturated with carbonate of soda, and the oxide of manganese
precipitated is to be separated by filtration; the filtered liquid neu
tralized with hydrochloric acid is to be precipitated with chloride of
platina, which forms a difficultly soluble compound with the new
base, so that it may be washed with cold water; these precipitations
must not, however, be made in solutions which are very dilute; the
precipitation may also be effected by bichloride of mercury.

solutions are mixed hot, it precipitates on the cooling of the mix

This salt also seems to be modified when it is redissolved, and ap
pears to contain ammonia.      When it is boiled with barytes water,
the base is decomposed and platina black is formed.

   Apophyllenic acid dissolves slowly and with difficulty in water;
and, except when the solution is made in hot water, the octahedral
crystals are obtained slowly. When the acid is made to crystallize
by cooling a boiling solution, the crystals occur in long aggregated
prisms, the form of which could not be determined; they do not ef
floresce, and are insoluble in alcohol and water.
   The taste of this acid is slightly sour and astringent.            When
heated, it melts, carbonizes and disengages an oleaginous substance,
which, to judge by          its

LIV.    On the Changes of Temperature produced by the Rare
   faction and Condensation of Air. By J. P. Joule, Esq.*
IN the
   a papert which was read before the Chemical Section of
       British Association at Cork, I applied Dr. Faraday's
fine discovery of magneto-electricity in order to establish defi
nite relations between heat and the ordinary forms of mecha
nical power.        In that paper it was demonstrated experiment
ally that the mechanical power exerted in turning a magneto
electrical machine is converted into the heat evolved by the
passage of the currents of induction through             coils; and,         its                             on

              the Rarefaction and Condensation         of Air.         371
 represents the condensing pump, consisting of a cylinder of
 gun-metal, and of a piston fitted with a plug of oiled leather,
 which works easily, yet lightly, through a stroke of 8 inches.
                                            ;
 The cylinder is 10; inches long, 1 inch in interior diame
 ter, and 3 of an inch in thickness of metal. The pipe A, for
 the admission of air, is fitted to the lower part of the cylinder;
 at the bottom of this pipe there is a conical valve, constructed
 of horn, opening downwards.            A copper receiver, R, which is
 12 inches   long,  4% inches in exterior diameter, # of an inch
 thick, and has a capacity of 136} cubic inches, may be screwed
 upon the pump at pleasure. This receiver is furnished with
 a conical valve of horn opening downwards, and, at the bot
 tom, with a piece of brass, B, along the centre of which there
 is a bore of #th of an inch diameter. There is a stop-cock at
 S which I shall describe more particularly in the sequel.
    Anticipating that the changes of temperature of the large
 quantity of water which was necessary in order to surround
 the receiver and pump would be very minute, I was at great
 pains in providing a thermometer of extreme sensibility and
 very great accuracy.       A tube of narrow bore having been se
lected, a column of mercury, 1 inch long, was introduced, and
gradually advanced in such a manner that the end of the co
lumn in one position coincided with the beginning of the co
lumn in the next. In each position the length of the column
was ascertained to the rºboth part of an inch, by means of an
instrument invented for the purpose by Mr. Dancerº. After
wards the tube was covered with a film of bees’-wax, and each
of the previously measured spaces was divided into twenty
equal parts by means of a steel point carried by the dividing
instrument; it was then etched by exposure to the vapour of
fluoric acid. The scale thus formed was entirely arbitrary,
and as it only extended between 30° and 90°, it was necessary
to compare the thermometer with another, constructed in the
same manner, but furnished with a scale including the boiling
as well as the freezing point.           When this was done, it was
found that ten divisions of the sensible thermometer (occupy
ing about ; an inch) were nearly equal to the degree of Fahr
enheit; therefore, since by practice I can easily estimate with
the naked eye gºth of each of these divisions, I could with this
instrument determine temperatures to the 2 oth part of a
degree. The scale being arbitrary, the indications of the

have great pleasure in acknowledging here the skill displayed by this gen
tleman in the construction of the different parts of my apparatus; to it I
must, in a great measure, attribute whatever success has attended the  ex
periments detailed in this paper.

372        Mr. Joule         on the Changes       of Temperature produced                       by
thermometer had to be reduced in every instance, a circum
stance which accounts for my having given the temperatures
in the tables to three places of decimals.
    It was important to employ, for the purpose of containing
the water, a vessel as impermeable to heat as possible. With
this view, two jars of tinned iron, one of them every way an
 inch smaller than the other, having been provided, the smaller
jar was placed within the larger one, and the interstice between
the two was closed hermetically.          By this means a stratum of
air of    nearly the same temperature as the water was kept in
 contact with the sides and bottom of the inner jar. The jars
 used in the other experiments which I shall bring forward
 were constructed in a similar manner. Among other precau
 tions to ensure accuracy, proper screens were placed between
 the vessels of water and the experimenter.
     My first experiments were conducted in the following man
 ner:—The pump and copper receiver were immersed into
 45 lbs. 3 ozs. of water, into which the very sensible thermometer
 above described was then placed; whilst two other thermome
 ters were employed in order to ascertain the temperature of
 the room and that of the water contained by the vessel W.
  Having stirred the water thoroughly,                           its
                                                      temperature was
 carefully read off. The pump was then worked                      mode           at   a
 rate degree     ofspeed until about twenty-two atmospheres                                          of
 air, dried     by
                 being passed through the vessel                            G.         of
                                                           full     small
 pieces    ofchloride      calcium, were compressed into the copper
                              of
 receiver.     After this operation (which occupied from fifteen
     twenty minutes) the water was stirred for five minutes
to to
                                                                                                so
     diffuse the heat equably through every part, and then                                           its as
 temperature was again read off.
     The increase temperature thus observed was owing partly
                         of
                              the air, and partly also

 the air-pipe    A  was closed, and the pump was worked                the             at
  same velocity and for the same time           before, and the water

                                              the first instance.    The
 consequent increase          temperature indicated heat due
                                   of                                 fric                 to

      The result given in the above Table is the difference be
  tween the effects of condensation and friction alone, corrected
  for the slight superiority of the cooling influence of the atmo
  sphere in the experiments on friction.       We must now, how
  ever, proceed to apply a further correction, on account of the
  circumstance that the friction of the piston was considerably
  greater during the condensing experiments than during the
  experiments to ascertain the effect of friction.       In the latter
  case the piston worked with a vacuum beneath            whilst    the               it,                in

quantity of cold would have been produced in the experiments
given in Table           III.
                       The results are, however, such as might
have been deduced a priori from any theory in which heat is
regarded as a state of motion among the constituent particles
of bodies. It is easy to understand how the mechanical force
expended in the condensation of air may be communicated to
these particles so as to increase the rapidity of their motion,
and thus may produce the phaenomenon of increase of tempe
rature.    In the experiments of Table         no cold was pro      III.
duced, because the momentum of these particles was not per
manently converted into mechanical power; but had the mo
tion of the air from one vessel to the other been opposed in
such a manner as to develope power at the outside of the jar,
which might have been accomplished by means of a cylinder
and piston, then loss of heat would have occurred, just as in
Tables IV., V. and VI., where the force was applied in li<U+017F>ting
the atmosphere of the earth.
   It is quite evident that the reason why the cold in the ex
periments of Table IV. was so much inferior in quantity to
the heat evolved in those of Table         that all the forceI.,   is                                of

 suppose that these atmospheres of electricity, endowed to a
 certain extent with the ordinary properties of matter, revolve
 with vast velocity round their respective atoms; and that the
 velocity of rotation determines what we call temperature. In
 an aeriform fluid we may suppose that the attraction of the at
 mospheres by their respective atoms, and that of the atoms
 towards one another, are inappreciable for                    pressures              all                           to

to destroy belongs to the Creator alone,        entirely coincide           I
with Roget and Faraday in the opinion, that any theory which,
when carried out, demands the annihilation of force, is neces
sarily erroneous. The principles, however, which I have ad
vanced in this paper are free from this difficulty. From them
we may infer that the steam, while expanding in the cylinder,
loses heat in quantity exactly proportional to the mechanical
force which it communicates by means of the piston; and that
on the condensation of the steam, the heat thus converted into
power is not given back. Supposing no loss of heat by radia
tion, &c., the theory here advanced demands that the heat
given out in the condenser shall be less than that communi
cated to the boiler from the furnace, in exact proportion to
the equivalent of mechanical power developed.
   It would lengthen this paper to an undue extent were I now
to introduce any direct proofs of these views, had I even lei
sure at present to make the experiments requisite for the pur
pose; I shall therefore reserve the further discussion of this
interesting subject for a future communication, which I hope
 to have the honour of presenting to the Royal Society at no
distant period.

  Production of Organic Bases which contain Chlorine and Bro
      mine.    By Dr. AUGUST WILHELM HoFMANN, Assistant in
      the Giessen   Laboratoryt.
  THE         changes which result from the action of various
           bodies upon indigo have for a series of years engaged
  the attention of chemists. It may be even said that this sub
 ject has been selected with preference for investigation; and
  when we consider the rich harvests already obtained by a
  great number of celebrated chemists, there would appear, at the
  first glance, scarcely anything to be gleaned. It is however
  the character of every rapidly-advancing science, that each
  discovery becomes the source of numerous others, and that
 the solution of every question gives rise to others which must
 in their turn be answered. It was thus that the further                in
 vestigation of the products from the decomposition of indigo,
 which had been already so thoroughly studied in many points
 by Laurent and Erdmann, led to results which appeared to
 me worthy of publication.
      Before proceeding, however, to the description of these re
 sults, it may be advantageous to make a few preliminary ob
 servations for the purpose of showing the reasons for which -
 these investigations have been undertaken.
     Among the various theories which have of late years
 claimed the attention of chemists, that of substitution occu
pies a very prominent place.            It is not my intention to exa
 mine the numerous          phases  of this discussion, for the most
 part carried on in France, nor to consider minutely the vari
 ous consequences which had their rise in this originally ex
 tremely simple question. The problem which forms the basis
 of the present investigation is a more general experimental
 establishment of a single substitution theorem.
     If  we examine carefully the origin of the theory of substi
 tutions, we shall be able to trace it to the endeavour to pre
 determine, by means of certain laws experimentally esta
blished, the changes to be produced upon a body through the
action of chlorine, bromine, oxygen, &c.               In the course of
such investigations it was however perceived, that in order to

   '#  I  have had the pleasure of witnessing the care and accuracy with
which the author of this paper has proceeded in making his observations
and establishing his facts.
    It appears to me that he has produced a definite and irrefragable proof
that the chemical character of a compound does not depend, as the electro
chemical theory supposes, upon the nature of the elements it contains, but
solely on the manner of their grouping.—JUSTUs LIFBIG.

foretell these changes a complete knowledge of the constitution
of the original body was necessary, and that this must be                              in
cluded in the argument. This discussion is not yet terminated,
nor are we at present in a position to give an opinion as to
its final result; this however is certain, that it has been the
means of originating many excellent investigations, from which
 science has derived the greatest advantage.
    It is now eight years since Laurent was led by a series of
experiments to a peculiar mode of representing the action of
 chlorine on organic bodies, and among other views, of which we
 do not require here to speak, he laid down the following law:—
    “In many organic compounds, by the action of chlorine,
a certain number of equivalents of hydrogen are eliminated in
 the form of hydrochloric acid; the eliminated hydrogen being
 replaced by a like number of equivalents of chlorine, in such
 a manner, that the chemical character and the fundamental
 properties of the original compound are not sensibly altered.
 The chlorine molecules therefore must take the place of the
 hydrogen molecules, and play in the new compound the same
 part which was performed by the hydrogen molecules in the
original.”
   The ideas of Laurent, which were opposed to the electro
chemical theory, and to the views generally received at that
time, found, as might be expected, but an indifferent recep
tion from chemists at the period of their publication.              His
views were reproached with being supported by too small a
number of facts; even his facts were assailed, and the author
required    all his dexterity and steady perseverance           defend       to
himself   against   his powerful opponents.      He repeated many

desired compound would likewise be crystalline, by which the
investigation would be rendered essentially easier.  resolved                        I
therefore to make  my experiments in this direction.
                    Action of CHLoRINE on ANILINE.
   I began by    carefully repeating my earlier experiments, but
obtained exactly the same results.
   As the action of chlorine on aniline immediately forms
hydrochloric acid,                 I
                         chose a solution of the base in this acid,
and passed    through   it slowly a stream of the chlorine. After
a few moments the fluid became violet, thickened and depo
sited a brown resinous matter, which fell to the bottom of the
vessel.   On submitting the whole fluid to distillation, a cry
stalline substance was deposited in the neck of the retort in
the form of white needles, consisting of a mixture of two dif
ferent bodies, which are easily separated by a second distil
lation with potash; an indifferent crystalline substance passes
over, of which           I
                   shall immediately speak, and chlorophenissate
of potash remains in the retort. The resinous matter sub
mitted alone to distillation gave likewise a large quantity of
chlorophenissic acid.
   In no case could I obtain any other results than the above,
however much I modified my experiments by employing a
more or less diluted solution, and substituting a watery solu
tion of chlorine instead of the gas.                        I
                                          soon found that the de
sired end could not be attained in this direct way, and had
consequently to have recourse to an indirect method.
   Aniline, originally discovered by Unverdorben” among the
products of distillation of indigo, was afterwards produced by
Fritzschef on submitting anthranilic acid to the same pro
cess, and by Zininf through the action of sulphuretted hy
drogen on nitrobenzid.        The idea occurred to me to try the
action of chlorine on anthranilic acid, and should it so happen
that in this way out of the anthranilic acid Cl4 H, NO, by the
substitution        of chlorine,          a compound,               C14       §     "

that the oily fluid which distils over with the water condenses
into a white crystalline mass in the neck of the retort, or, if
this is too hot, in the cooled receiver. If the distillation is
carefully conducted to prevent any of the fluid spirting over,
the product collected in the receiver does not react alkaline so
long as there remains a considerable quantity of water in the
retort. When, however, the substance in the retort becomes
nearly dry, a considerable quantity of ammonia, together with
hydrogen, begins to be evolved, and the upper part of the re
tort becomes covered with a blue matter, which is sometimes
carried over with the watery vapour into the receiver; at the
same time the oily drops which have distilled over, from being
colourless, now become brown and no longer solidify.           At
this period the distillation must be interrupted.
   The crystalline substance which collects in the receiver can
be purified with the greatest ease, by being thrown on a filter
and washed with distilled water till all trace of ammonia is
removed. To obtain it chemically pure, it is to be dissolved
in boiling alcohol, from which it crystallizes in regular octa
hedrons.     From the analysis it will be seen that this com
pound is aniline, in which one equivalent of hydrogen is re
placed by one equivalent of chlorine.        In short, it presents
 allthe chemical characters and     properties    aniline, and    of                    is

formed crystals are produced. In describing the correspond

become white and opake by the application of heat.             If the

sal-ammoniac; by sudden elevation of the temperature, how
ever, the salt is decomposed with evolution of a violet-blue
 vapour.

my observation during the course          the present inquiry.
Action         of the Oxygenated Compounds
                                                                  of of

 violet-red and then gradually turbid and brown. The action
 is much hastened by the addition of alcohol, by which at the
 same time, however, acetic aether is formed.          By long-con
 tinued action the fluid becomes again colourless, and a yellow
 crystalline matter is obtained, which can be easily purified by
 washing with alcohol and aether, in which it is but little soluble.
     This substance crystallizes from boiling alcohol on cooling
 in small yellow plates. By slowly heating it sublimes without
 residue in the form of beautiful glittering scales of a golden
 colour. Potash forms with it a blood-red solution, from which,
 after some time, ruby-red prisms separate, which become of a
 vermilion colour by moistening with hydrochloric acid, and
 after removal of the acid dissolve in pure water with a beau
 tiful violet colour.   All these phaenomena characterize in an
 undoubted manner the chloranil discovered by Erdmann in
 his investigations on indigo, a substance which, as I proved”
 a few months ago, is formed also in many other processes.
   If  the action of the oxidizing mixture on the chloraniline is
 not allowed to go so far, the chloranil is obtained mixed with
a viscid matter, which is very soluble in alcohol and aether.
On evaporating off the aether and submitting the resinous re
sidue to distillation, oily drops pass over and crystallize in the
neck of the retort. They possess the characteristic smell and
peculiar reactions which distinguish the chlorophenissic or
chlorophenussic acid of Laurent, namely the forming a violet
precipitate with sulphate of copper, and a citron yellow with
nitrate of silver.

        I   made a great number of experiments to discover under
what conditions this    body   was formed, but as yet I have not
been able to   produce   it at will. In most cases I obtained                                                   in
stead a resinous body, which was precipitated in the form of
yellow flakes from the nitric acid by addition of water, and
which possessed the same property as nitropicric acid of tin
ging the skin. This substance is soluble in alcohol and aether,
but cannot be obtained from the solution in a crystalline form.
It is also soluble in the alkalies and ammonia, and is again
precipitated by acids. By boiling the ammoniacal solution
till the excess of ammonia is removed, and then adding nitrate
of silver, a reddish-yellow precipitate is formed, which I was
able to obtain only on one occasion in a crystalline form. My
substance was, however,                     all

rated aniline. Its carbon must, therefore, be completely
separated. The following formula exhibits this change:–
    *—             ——'
         Chloraniline.
This decomposition gives the key    to some phaenomena of which
I  have   already made mention in the preparation of chlorani
line.
     Imentioned that in the last stage of the distillation, so soon
as the mass in the retort commences to become dry, evolution
of ammonia takes place, and aniline at the same time distils
over. This reaction evidently depends on a transformation
similar to that just mentioned. The vapours of the chlori
nated base which deposit on the cooler parts of the apparatus
meet with hot potash on the sides of the retort, and are de
composed into aniline, ammonia, and hydrochloric acid.
    By carefully mixing a small portion of very pure chlor
isatine with caustic baryta and slowly heating, a product of
distillation was obtained which did not exhibit the slightest
alkaline reaction, whilst, in the heated residue, not a trace of
chlorine could be detected.     All the nitrogen and chlorine of
the chlorisatine had  consequently    distilled over in the form of
chloraniline.

to the subject would involve an extent of writing and printing
not only incompatible with the limits of the Philosophical Ma
gazine, but of the patience of the most determined reader.
    But in point of fact such readers are few indeed. Mathe
matical and mechanical controversies (especially if either party
has the dexterity to make them turn, as a last shift, upon the
metaphysic of a term) are known, by sad experience, even to
have outlived their originators, and to have been bequeathed
to a second generation, without the world being a whit the
wiser, or the combatants approaching mutual conviction.
And in our own days of bustle and emulation it may be taken
for granted that such controversies are absolutely unread,
except by the parties and one or two partizans, at least when
they have reached the first rejoinder.
    I  disclaim, therefore, the intention of entering into contro
versy with Mr. Hopkins, although far from saying that I will
not defend my opinions against his, so far as they shall really
be found to differ.       But this I will do by an independent as
sertion of facts and observations and reasonings, which shall
tend to the advancement of truth, as well as to the exposure of
error on the part of others.
    If  we deduct from Mr. Hopkins's writings twenty-eight
pages of a paper written on the Theory of Glaciers before he
had made himself personally acquainted with the great facts
about which he had to reason, there remain eighty-nine pages
of matter before us. To enter into a controversy would, there
fore, require an analysis of these.          I will briefly state a few
reasons, independent of the mere extent of the controversy,
which seem to exempt me from a collision with Mr. Hopkins
upon every point which he has thought it proper to discuss.
     1. On account of the fluctuations of opinion they contain.
If   there be any, beside myself, who have read the whole of
these eighty-nine pages, they know that, as regards many
opinions and assertions, it would be easy to place Mr. Hop
kins at issue with himself.        Fortunately we are not altogether
left to the   interpretation  of algebraical  symbols and of English
words, for both of these admit of much dexterity in their qua
lification, but the author has clothed his views in the earlier
stage of authorship in diagrams sufficiently plain to admit of
no dubiety.       Of course, I only complain that Mr. Hopkins,
whilst    altering  his opinions, does not allow that he is con
vinced by the arguments opposed to them. The first rigour
of his views underwent some plastic change when my Travels
appeared; and in proportion as his attention was forced to the
mechanical theory there presented, they assumed successively
a more and more ductile form; the very notions of plasticity

4.08                    Prof. Forbes's Reply to Mr. Hopkins
kins thinks himself entitled to set aside a theory upon which I
had spent so much time, exertion, and thought, in three para
graphs containing two objections (2nd mem. p. 4, 5). The one
is the verticality of the crevasses, the other the want of evi
dence of the longitudinal compression of the glacier.             The
former has been     fully explained  by   me in  my  Travels,  p. 370,
and more recently in my Seventh Letter on Glaciers; the                                                   lat

                    of                                                                                     to

substance. It is no good to cite Mr. Hodgkinson's observa
tion, that in the case of cast iron crushing force produced a
single line of fracture, which, besides, was very far from being
always the case. This shows only that under the circumstances
of temperature and crushing force, iron was not a substance
calculated to illustrate the analogy of glaciers, which might
have been easily foreseen.          It is evidently a begging of the
question to say, that because iron did not yield at many points
under a crushing force, therefore glacier-ice will not. The
difference too is palpable; a cubic inch of ice may be crushed by
a small weight, that of iron only by many tons.              Then again,
Mr.   Hopkins,    taking  up  an illustration of    my  own,  says a sheet
of paper whose edges are pulled in opposite directions tears
but in one place*. This is true for the writing-paper which
Mr. Hopkins uses, but let him trace the same paper in the

general appearance, and the unequal motion of the sides and
centre which their existence alone renders possible, is the best
evidence of their origin, especially as their general direction
corresponds to what a “popular” view of the mechanism of
the case would indicate, and most accurately to the observed
results in the plastic models. This is the chief evidence which
I  have for the origin of the ribboned structure being “a forced
separation of a half rigid mass”;” and it has this advantage
over Mr. Hopkins's speculations, that he does not profess to
offer any explanationt of this, the most elaborate and curious
peculiarity of a glacier.
    6. Yet something may be gleaned from Mr. Hopkins's
writings, showing a disposition to yield even this point.                                                 Ex
actly in proportion as his statements have become more defi
nite and tangible, and he has moderated the use of analysis,
with which he at first attempted to carry his point by storm,
his admissions to the viscous theory have become more fre
quent and explicit.       The combination of this passage in the
Second Letter      (p. 166), “any internal constraint which might
be superinduced by the peculiar motion of the glacier, would
be relieved Both by transverse fracture and by the sliding of
one part past another,” with that in the Third Letter (p. 243),
“I   am far from supposing that the origin of this structure
 [the blue bands] is unconnected with the motion of the gla
cier,” seems as nearly an admission of the theory which have                                         I
proposed of this structure as can well be imagined. Again, in
the Second Letter, Mr. Hopkins admits plasticity as an attri
bute of glaciers with this qualification;            mean that plasti“I

application      <U+017F>orce, possibly

                                                               is   ofthis                           as

                                                                     of

and hence the term secular plasticity,            which Mr. Hopkins by
has attempted          raise partition between his views and my

416           Prof. Forbes's Reply to Mr. Hopkins
sideration of the movement of fluids possessing viscosity and
that of plastic bodies (which is an extension of the same case)
under their own weight.       Let him, for instance, consider the
lines of greatest tension in a viscous fluid extending itself in a
sloping trough when a sluice has been withdrawn, and the
tendencies to separation by sliding of the parts over, one
another.     Such I presume is the kind of mathematical                     in
vestigations which Dr. Whewell means to recommend in
his First Letter to Mr. Taylor *. The application to very
viscous bodies will then not be difficult.      It will at best be a
“popular” view; nor will the mathematical expression of the
forces and motions increase our knowledge (in the first                     in
stance) beyond what experiment, guided by general mechani
cal principles, has already unfolded or may unfold. The ma
thematician who values facts only, “pour donner prise au
calcul,” must be glad if his results can be shaped so as to re
present what is already known to be experimentally true. But
he must not hope to predict phaenomena, or to consider that
his symbolizing adds much weight to a mechanical theory.
 That must be the office of the inductive philosopher who can
see his way in advance of the operations of his analytic tool.
Nevertheless, by viewing the subject on more sides than one,
something will be gained, and it may be hoped that the vis
cous theory will then be fairly treated and impartially com
pared with the facts of glaciers.
   Thus Mr. Hopkins will satisfy both himself and me;—him
self, by putting the glacier theory in a more mathematical form
than I have given     it; and me,          by
                                      his becoming thenceforward

                                  on the        Motion of Glaciers.                                        417
ential movements of points in the transverse section occur, and
secondarily, lines of disruption or transverse crevasses perpen
dicular to the former.       Now Mr. Hopkins denies that the
former “ribboned structure” is produced by differential
motion (p. 331, first paragraph).     I have only to request him,
when he next    repeats  the experiment, to watch the motions of
the coloured particles on the surface, which is easily done, and
he will perceive (with greatest distinctness in the higher parts
of the model, where the tearing force is most violent) that the
parts do visibly and mechanically slide past one another in
such directions. No person who sees the model made, or has
even been told how it was made, and inspects the “ribboned
structure” on               its
                    surface, can,    think, unless influenced by
                                                          I

ammoniac or a volatile muriate was present is proved by the
second result.
   It is well known that Dr. Prout by similar experiments
drew the conclusion that free hydrochloric acid was present in
the stomach. That distinguished chemist however omitted the
                                  I
first experiment which have described. Indeed he could not
have made it successfully under the circumstances in which he
operated, because the gastric juice in his experiments was not
exposed to a heat that could coagulate and separate the albu
minous matters, which would then have combined with the
oxide of silver and have complicated the result.                In the gas
tric juice employed in the preceding researches, however, no
thing was present but soluble starch or dextrin and sugar,
which formed obviously no compounds with silver, insolu
ble in boiling nitric acid. It is possible, therefore, in the
experiments of Dr. Prout, who determined the total amount
of chlorine in the gastric fluid by supersaturating with pot
ash, igniting and precipitating with nitrate of silver, that he
had formed cyanide of potassium, which would precipitate
 cyanide of silver along with the chloride, unless the pre
 caution were taken not merely to add nitric acid, but to
 boil the solution after the addition of the acid, since cyanide
 of silver is insoluble, or at least not wholly decomposed by
 cold nitric acid.          I
                          offer this explanation, originally proposed
 by Leuret and Lassaigne, because from my knowledge of Dr.
 Prout, I am quite certain his experiments were most accu
 rately made.       Indeed, the testimony of          succeeding experi

 matter closely corresponding with sugar is found in the sto
 mach. Experiment was scarcely necessary to prove that sugar
 exists in the stomach, since as all flour and meal contain
 sugar, it is obvious that when these articles of diet are swal
 lowed, sugar must be present in that viscus. But as it exists
 in the stomach, it is natural to expect that it should pass into
 the blood-vessels, and be capable of being detected in the mass
 of the sanguineous circulation.          That fermentation can be
 excited by yeast in many of the fluids of the body, was long
 ago shown by Tiedemann and Gmelin.                 Dr. A. Buchanan
 during the course of last winter obtained traces of carbonic
 acid from serum by fermentation, and                             I
                                                 repeated the experi
 ments with success; but                 I
                                found it necessary to be careful in
 such a delicate experiment that no source of fallacy should be
 present to complicate the result, and that in order to arrive at
 a demonstration of the presence of sugar in the blood, it would
 be requisite to resort to weighing.          For this purpose I em
 ployed what may be termed a saccharometer. It consists of
 two light phials or flasks connected by a bent tube, one or
 both of which possess a safety-tube. The serum or fluid to
 be examined is weighed out in one of the flasks, which is placed
in a vacuum, or in hydrogen gas, to remove any carbonic acid
in solution, while into the other is introduced a solution of ba
rytes, the bent tube dipping considerably under the surface of
the barytes solution.      Yeast being mixed with the serum, the
connexion between the flasks is established, and the whole ap
paratus placed in a warm atmosphere (70°).              Fermentation
speedily begins if sugar is present, and the carbonic acid as it
passes over precipitates the barytes in the form of carbonate.
In twelve hours the action will be at an end; the flask con
taining the serum is then to be heated to carry over any CO,
which may remain in          atmosphere

LIX.    On the Necessity of Three Fundamental Equations for
   the general    analytical determination of the Motion of Fluids.

   tronomy and Experimental Philosophy in the University of
   Cambridge*.
     HE communications which I have made from time to time
       to this Journal on the analytical theory of hydrodyna
mics have had particular reference to the mathematical prin
ciples of this department of science.           In the course of my                                                      in
quiries I have been led to the conclusion, that those principles,
as commonly received, are essentially defective. I have pointed
out wherein I conceive them to be defective, and what appears
to be necessary to complete them. These views have not been
                                                 I
refuted, nor, as far as am aware, have they been assented                                                                   to.

Fundamental Equations            for determining Motion of Fluids. 427
These, however, are merely suppositions of continuity, neces
sary to be made that the subject may admit of the application
of mathematical calculation, and virtually contained in the
supposition of the existence of normal surfaces. Not being
able to discover any objection that can be raised against the
principles and the reasoning which have conducted to equa
     wººl
tion (A.), I shall assume this equation to be true.
   Now the   only general equations of hydrodynamics hitherto
recognised are the two following:—
           dg
                      *** *            *; gº   +     4:3" = 0,      .   .    .        (1.)

                      +(Z- (#))a=}
which are so well known that I need not explain the significa
tion of the symbols. These equations are perfectly general in
their character, and if they are sufficient in number for the
general consideration of fluid motion, the equation (A.) must
either be identical with one of them, or must be derivable from
the two combined.      It cannot be identical with (2.), because
it does not involve the impressed forces X, Y, Z. For the
same reason it cannot be deduced from a combination of (1.)
and (2.); and it is not identical with (1.) for the following
reason:—In the differential coefficient                   tºy of equation            (A.),
the variation of coordinates is necessarily from one point to
another of a line of motion, while the differential coefficients
of equation (1.) are subject to no such limitation.
   It follows, therefore, that another general equation, inde
pendent of the impressed forces, must exist, by the combina
tion of which with equation (1.), equation (A.) may result.
The considerations we have gone through will guide us in the
investigation   of   it.      It   is   well known that        if   +   be   a   factor

rests on the gratuitous assumption that u da + v dy + w d x is
an exact differential.     The reasoning     I have gone through
shows that the motion deduced is inconsistent with that as
sumption (see Cambridge Philosophical Transactions, vol.
viii. part i. p. 41).
     The existence and the necessity of a third general equation
 in hydrodynamics being, as it appears to me, established, I
shall proceed at a future opportunity to make some applica
 tions of it.

    LX.    Remarks on Mr. Hopkins's Reply to the previous
       Remarks on Glacier Theories.        By Dr. WHEwell.
                      To Richard Taylor, Esq.
       DEAR SIR,
        my remarks on glacier theories, printed in the Philo
 IN sophical     Magazine for February and for March, I did
 not mention Mr. Hopkins's name.           I abstained from doing
 so, in order to avoid, as far as was possible, any personal con
 troversy, such as he deprecates in a Reply to those remarks,
 printed in the Philosophical Magazine for April. Neverthe
 less, in that Reply, he speaks of a departure from the rules of
 strict courtesy, which charge he applies to me by name. Ap
 parently he was led to make this charge, through a belief that,
  by those who had read his Letters on glaciers, my remarks
 could not fail to be understood as applicable to him. This is
                                                I
 possible; but I am still unable to see how could have made,
  in a more inoffensive manner, the remarks which justice to
  Mr. Forbes seemed to me to require. And I cannot but think
  Mr. Hopkins would have better promoted the object of avoid
  ing personal controversy, if he had replied, supposing he
  thought reply necessary, in the same impersonal manner.
  This would have thrown no difficulty in the way of his show
  ing my remarks to be inapplicable to him, if he could have
  done so. And if he had done this, I think it most likely that
  none of your readers would have discovered the “sarcasm"
  of which he complains.

432       Dr. Whewell's                     Remarks on                 Mr. Hopkins's Reply.
    In my remarks, I described four steps which a theorist
 might make, in passing gradually from the doctrine of a solid
 to that of a plastic glacier.         The first step             suppose the           by is,
 solid glacier divided into longitudinal strips               arbitrary sepa              to
 rations; the second                allow is, possible separation by sli
                                                to                   a
 ding    at     all
               points       the  mass;

flanks      of
             the glacier are plastic; the fourth                     allow the             is,   to
glacier       have
                to      secular plasticity.

                                             Mr. Hopkins; having been

previously excluded                him; and by       this manner            in

such     asthose of the structural bands which Prof. Forbes dis
covered.
I     will make one remark.             had objected I     the term secular           to
plasticity, because the plasticity           glaciers produces       ofconspi                         a
cuous effect          few days. Mr. Hopkins says, that “no such

an  application               of
                       the term    describing    the  plasticity       glaciers                   of

434     Mr. Bryce           on a      Tertiary Deposit lately discovered
a few only being found in the upper sand and clay. The
shells are in every state of preservation: some are rolled and
polished; some, though strong shells, are broken into frag
ments, while others, though of a fragile nature, are in a state
of perfect preservation. The same observation has been made
by Captain Portlock respecting the tertiary clays of Lon
donderry (Report, chap. vi.); and he points out the con
clusion to be drawn from it respecting the origin of these
beds.
   There have been identified in                         all
                                            forty-five species         shells,                       of

North-western Donegal, a distance of seventy or eighty miles,
as such rocks occur there in situ, but they bear a much closer
resemblance to the pebbles of Scottish origin which strew the
shores at the mouth of the bay; and thus they point back to
that remote condition of things, when the whole trap district
was still rising above the level of the sea, but when the elevated
country at the base of the mountains, from Belfast to Car
rickfergus, was yet under water, and the waves were beating
against the base of the basaltic precipices.

           to the thick alluvial cover, the precise extent of this
shelly deposit cannot be determined: it is certainly known to
occupy several acres, but it may extend much farther. Traces
of a clay deposit with shells have been noticed at several places
on the northern shores of the bay, at heights reaching from
near the sea-level to sixty feet. They have been passed
through in well-borings, but have yielded only a few frag
ments.    The intended cuttings on two projected lines of rail
way will give complete sections of the superficial clay beds,
and it is to be hoped, will furnish some interesting facts.

           OWEVER       eminent the abilities of the late Dr. Young,
          he  certainly   did not study the art of writing in such a
 style, that not only he might possibly be understood by those of
 his readers who comprehended the subject nearly as well as
himself, but that he could not possibly be misunderstood by any
 one of ordinary capacity and attention—an invaluable art, too
 little attended to by English philosophers.

    3. What is the proportional effect of looking through the
four-inch focus lens, and looking simply along a black line,
some three feet long? For example, if looking through the
slits and lens, an eye can make the lines cross at two inches
and at four inches, and at any intermediate distance, what is
the real average focus of that eye?
    To use a homely but forcible comparison, I would say, Dr.

that “the disciple can arrive there without a boat.”    A few
lucid paragraphs would furnish the boats on this occasion, and

        LXIII.         On the State of Oridation                 of Iron in Soils.
                        By RICHARD PHILLIPs,                    Jun.*
HAVING     for some time past directed my attention                                      to the
   analysis of soils, I have been somewhat surprised                                     at the
remark I have met with in the works on Agricultural Che
mistry of Prof. Johnston and others, that the lowest state of
oxidation of iron or the protoxide is when occurring in soils
injurious to vegetation; my own experience having led me
to the conclusion, that although it is not necessary to the fer
tility of a soil that it should exist in that state, nevertheless,
that in     all
             soils rich    humus    in    found. it        so
                                                    The grounds

forward, are the following:—Bog earths have been found                                         to
 be unfit for vegetation; and the drainage water from them,
when used for the purposes           irrigation,

was sent to me from Yorkshire, and with it some experiments
I shall afterwards detail, were made.  Mr. Smith of Deanston,

potash, by which it was deprived of   carbonic acid;     by
                                                      then

tube containing chloride         calcium, been deprived
                                        of                   any
moisture      might
                it    have  acquired,  through  some bulbs partly
filled with caustic potash, these were connected with Woulfe's                              a

the other with boiling water: the first gave 1.95 per cent.                                                 of

 LXIV.      Reply to some Remarks of Prof. A. Leymerie on the
    Identification of certain Lower Greensand Fossils. By Prof.
    Edward Forbes, F.R.S., of King's College, London.
                       To Richard Taylor, Esq.
       DEAR SIR,
            last Number of the Philosophical Magazine appears
 IN athe translation of a paper read before the Geological So
ciety of France, by Prof. A. Leymerie, and entitled “Obser
vations on a Communication made by Dr. Fitton to the Geo
logical Society of France at the Meeting of May 20, 1844, on
the Lower Greensand of the Isle of Wight,” read November
4, 1844, and published in the Bulletin of the French Geolo
gical Society for January 1845.
    In that paper M. Leymerie is rather severe upon me and
my palaeontological determinations, unreasonably, as I con
ceive, and I hope you will permit me to reply through the
medium of the Philosophical Magazine.              I am the more
anxious to do so, in order to prove to my geological friends
that I do not deserve the accusations of hastiness and careless
ness preferred against me by M. Leymerie, and that         I did not
draw up the lists of Lower Greensand fossils for Dr. Fitton and
other English geologists interested in the Neocomian question,
without full and due consideration and good materials before
ille,
    Fortunately the accusations are more special than general.
M. Leymerie has fully stated the grounds of his doubts. At
once, then,    I  will go over separately the list of species (eight
in number) which forms the text of the lesson he would read
me.
    The first  is “Pholadomya    Prevosti, Deshayes,” identified by
me with Mya plicata, Sowerby—wrongly according to M.
Leymerie, who adds, moreover, on M. Deshayes' authority,
that the species of Sowerby is a Panopaea, whilst the French
shell is a Pholadomya.
    I identified the English fossil, which certainly is the species
of the Mineral Conchology, with the French for the following
reasons:–1st. One of the commonest varieties of the Lower
Greensand, Panopaea plicata, exactly agrees with the figure
and description given by M. Deshayes in M. Leymerie's paper
on the Cretaceous Formation of l’Aube.           2nd. Specimens of
the   English   shell sent to France were returned as P. Prevosti
by M. d’Orbigny.           3rd. Specimens of the French shell
brought to England were compared by myself with our own
specimens, and found to be identical.         As to the genus to
which both     English   and French shells  belong,  there can now

            Prof. E. Forbes's Reply to Prof. A. Leymerie.                                                  443
be no doubt on the subject;              they are certainly Panopaeae.
This    I  know from the examinations of English specimens
showing the dentition, which is identical with that of the
French shells, as recently figured in the Paléontologie Fran
caise, so that any argument from supposed difference of
genus must fall to the ground.
   2nd. “Astarte Beaumontii, Leym.”—This I identified with
the Astarte obovata of the Mineral Conchology. That the En
glish shell is identical with the French,          hardly think M. Ley    I
merie himself would      dispute.    I identified it by comparison with
French specimens, as well as by                              its
                                             agreement with the figures

 impression is that M. d’Orbigny is right, and that the
 British and French forms are varieties of one species; and if
 so, they certainly should be referred to C. eraltata, rather
 than burden our lists with a new name.

        Sowerby, referring the shell to the genus Natica.   Dr. Fitton
        having taken his list from my unpublished catalogue of the
        Lower Greensand fossils in the collection of the Geological
        Society, adopted the revised name. Were French naturalists
        in the habit of referring specific appellations to the original
        authorities for them, and not of appending their own names
        after those of old species, whenever they remove them from
        one genus to another, M. Leymerie would probably have
        searched a little more diligently for a figure and description of
        this pretty shell, which is undoubtedly the Ampullaria laevi
        gata, as         I

446        Prof. E. Forbes's Reply to Prof. A. Leymerie.
Trigonia scabra of Lamarck, M. Leymerie has misunderstood
Dr. Fitton's list. That list was given to show that many of
the supposed new Neocomian fossils of France were only well
known Lower Greensand fossils of England, some, no doubt,
known under names to which they had no claim, but not the
less Neocomian on that account; the Trigonia is an instance.
The shell which has hitherto figured in British lists as Tri
gonia scabra is certainly the Trigonia caudata of Agassiz, a
Neocomian species.    The French conchologists say that the
T. scabra of Lamarck is a different shell. Be it so; the case is
not changed, though the name scabra in our lists must be re
placed by that of caudata.
   So much for the palaeontological objections of M. Leymerie.
Permit me now to add a word on the general question”.
   It may be stated briefly as follows:—Dr. Fitton holds that
the formation intermediate between the Wealden and the
Gault, known in England as the Lower Greensand, is syn
chronic with the Neocomian of Neufchatel and l’Aube.
   M. Leymerie holds that the Neocomian         not all, the greater
                                                                 (if
part thereof)     synchronic, not with the English Lower Green
                      is
sand, but with the freshwater deposit        the Wealden.  of
   Tested palaeontologically,       maintain Dr. Fitton's view
                                               I                                                  is
right, not merely from closer examination
                                     a              specimens, but     of
                     investigations                         conjunc
                                                                                is in
also from careful                   made     the field     in
tion with  my   friend Captain   Ibbetson. This view       also held
on   natural-history grounds         England     inMr. Morris,       by                           in

                                 Montperreaux.  The doubts thrown
on  it   by   M. Leymerie, conceive, have been removed
                                    I                         the                            by
statements  put forth     this reply; for even were my names
                                    in
wrong (which       do not admit), the species
                          I                          which those           to
names were    applied are  undoubtedly   identical with French
Neocomian forms.
   Tested geologically, the hypothesis        M. Leymerie (or   of
rather     M.
           of    Beaumont,de whom      follows),      he
                                                  that during the
deposition       of
               the Wealden there must     necessarily  have been
a corresponding deposit       France, which,in   not freshwater      if         a
deposit, must have been marine, and that the Neocomian                                            is
such deposit, cannot stand for two reasons:—

 and gives the details of a series of observations on the blood of a
 human foetus that was born alive at the end of the sixth month.
 He examined the blood of the parent, and of the placenta, and also
 of different parts of the body of the foetus a few hours after death,
 and found in general that the blood of the parent contained a very
 large quantity of white chyle corpuscles, and was extremely coagu
 lable: the blood of the placenta contained, beside an abundance of
 chyle corpuscles, red blood-discs of extremely variable sizes, the
 largest being one-third or one-fourth larger than those of the
 mother, and the smallest scarcely more than one-fourth as large as
 the largest. There were also an immense abundance of molecules
 and nucleoli, from which latter the red blood-discs appeared to be
 developed. The blood of the vein and lungs presented a similar                                               ir
 regular condition as to size of the corpuscles, while that of the left
 auricle of the heart, aorta and arteries of the cord was more uniform
 in its character.      From these observations the author concludes,
 that the blood of the vertebrata is analogous in           mode      developits             of
 ment  to  that of the insects and other invertebrata, and that the red
 blood-discs are the ultimate developments              the opake white gra

John Frederick William Herschel, Bart., F.R.S. &c.
    The author inquires whether the peculiar coloured dispersion of
white light intromitted into a solution of sulphate of quinine, is the
result of an analysis of the incident light into two distinct species,
or merely of a simple subdivision analogous to that which takes
place in partial reflexion, as exemplified in the colours of thin plates.
He endeavours to ascertain the laws which regulate this singular
mode of dispersion, which for brevity he terms epipolic, on account
 of the proximity of the seat of dispersion to the intromitting surface
of the fluid. It might have been expected that by passing the same
incident beam successively through many such dispersive surfaces,
the whole of the blue rays would at length be separated from              and                                     it,

     light, meaning thereby         beam which has been once transmitted

     Feb. 5.—A paper was read “On Raised Beaches and the Shells
  found in them, occurring on the coast of Essex near Walton.”         By
  J. Brown, Esq., of Stanway.
     The object of this paper was to direct attention to the fact, that
  low raised beaches exist on this part of the eastern coast, and that
  they contain fossils, not only marine but freshwater, and confined to
  a small number of species, though individuals are very numerous.
  It was also the wish of Mr. Brown to bring these raised beaches into
 comparison with the beds called “Till” in the Clyde valley.
     A paper was next read “On the Geology of the vicinity of the
 Wollondilly River, in Argyle County, in the colony of Sydney, New
 South Wales.”       By the Rev. W. B. Clarke.
     The district described by the author is chiefly occupied by igneous
 rocks, upon which sedimentary rocks of the carboniferous period
repose unconformably.         The igneous rocks consist of granite and
 syenite, of porphyries, basalt and trachyte.       They pass into and
occasionally intersect one another, and are traversed by numerous
dykes of igneous rocks of various kinds.       The sedimentary rocks are
not less violently disturbed, and have become greatly altered in every
place where they have been brought into contact with the granite.
    A communication was also made by Dr. Fitton, “On the Beds of
the Lower Greensand of the Isle of Wight.”
    Dr. Fitton, after describing the general structure of the back of the
Isle of Wight, alluded to the numerous fissures or chines found in
these localities.    He also described the different beds of the lower
greensand, and mentioned the fossils most characteristic of each of
them.     He concluded by alluding to some of the fossils from the
Neocomian beds of the Continent, and mentioned the fact that these
foreign strata are strictly contemporaneous with the lower greensand
of England.

    REMARKABLE        DISCOVERY     OF MASTODON      BONES    IN NEW
                                  JERSEY.
A*      a meeting of the American Philosophical Society, December 6,
        1844, Prof. Frazer read a letter from Mr. J. B. Maxwell, one
of the trustees of Princeton College, to Prof. Henry, dated Belvidere,
October 17, 1844, relating to the discovery of Mastodon bones on
the farm of Mr. Abraham Ayers, near Hackettstown, New Jersey.
    There are portions of the skeletons of five Mastodons—one pretty
large, three of smaller size, and a calf: of the largest, only the
grinders, portions of the tusks (13% inches in circumference), and
some fragments of the larger bones remain, the rest having fallen
to pieces on being exposed to the air. The bones of the calf fell to
pieces in like manner, and no parts have been preserved except the

454.                 Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
grinders and the tusks, which were five or six inches long, about
three-quarters of an inch in diameter, and seem to have projected
more than an inch from the bone. Of the other three, the skulls and
most of the larger bones are in good preservation.   We measured
some parts of the largest of them, as follows —
Skull—from top of        head at junction of the muscles of the neck to
              end of bone between the tusks—3 feet 4 inches.

    There were three grinders                           on
                                      each side above, and the same num
 ber below. The two others and the calf had four teeth on each side,
 both above and below, but the forward ones were evidently “milk
 teeth,” which would have been shed               more advanced age.  at   a                                     In
 none      these four did the back grinders appear

 the gum.      The largest      the five had had three grinders
                                              of                        each                           on
 side     each jaw.
           in           All the grinders were      the same character, ha  of
 ving the projecting conical points which distinguish the Mastodon.
 In  one      the skulls, the tusks projected outwards and inclined up
                of
 wards, while         the other two they were inclined downwards and
                          in

 had induced Mr. Ayers          believe that the remains belonged
                                              to                        more                           to
 than one species.       But Mr. Maxwell considered              evident that         it   to   be
 the only differences are those        age and sex. The bones which

                          was evident both from the teeth and the sutures
  of the skull; and       the skull with projecting tusks seemed      have                            to         a
  broader and rounder outline than the others,           probably belonged           it

     Mr. Ayers walked with Mr. Maxwell            the spot where they were to

of east. Through one of these depressions, which is probably 150
feet below the general level of the range, passes the road from
Hackettstown to Vienna.                By looking at Gordon's Map of New
Jersey, a small stream is found to cross the road nearly half-way to
Vienna. Mr. Ayers's house is about 100 yards beyond the stream,
and the bones were found more than a quarter of a mile beyond his
house in a northerly direction, and perhaps 300 yards from the road.
The map does not represent the face of the country correctly. The
road runs along the northern side of the valley or depression, most
of which is occupied by a swampy meadow, through which the
stream flows.       From the road the ground rises regularly, but pretty
rapidly, probably 120 feet in 200 yards, and then descends more
gradually 25 or 30 feet into a smaller depression, which, however,
does not cut through the ridge like the larger one, but descends very
gradually from the general level on the east, and at                    western end                its

considered as a true acid, and as incapable of combining with acids
as a base to form salts.
   The following are the reasons given by the author for adopting
these opinions:—The action of peroxide of tin as an acid upon he
matin, and on examining the compound which it forms with acids, no
one of them possesses the properties of a salt; nitric acid dissolves
but an inappreciable quantity; it combines with sulphuric acid, but
the compound is decomposed by a few seconds' ebullition into sul
phuric and stannic acids; and the same happens with the most di
stinctly marked metallic acids, as with antimonic acid : as to the
compound of stannic with hydrochloric acid, may it not be compared
to the chlorides of arsenic, sulphur, phosphorus and antimony, which
have never been considered as true salts 2 Lastly, stannic acid does
not combine with organic acids, or at any rate they form very un
stable compounds, which are totally decomposed by water; under
these circumstances M. Fremy is of opinion, that stannic acid com
bines with other acids to form double acids of little stability, like
other compounds of this nature, instead of salts.         Compounds of
acids frequently occur in chemistry, and the complete decomposition
of them which water effects is to a certain extent characteristic of
them.
   M. Fremy states an experiment, which in his opinion demonstrates
positively that peroxide of tin is always an acid, even when separated
from combination with hydrochloric acid:—if a solution of bichloride
of tin be decomposed by carbonate of potash or soda, a precipitate is
obtained, which is not peroxide of tin, but stannate of potash or of
soda, which are insoluble in water containing a salt of potash;                                                        if,

   When hydrated metastannic acid is dissolved in potash or soda, a
salt is obtained, which, when decomposed by an acid, precipitates
gelatinous metastannic acid, possessing the same characters as the
acid before solution; it combines, for example, with hydrochloric
acid, and forms a compound perfectly similar to that obtained by
treating hydrated metastannic acid with hydrochloric acid.
   Metastannic acid, however, which has been precipitated from pot
ash or soda, differs from the acid which has not been dissolved in an
alkali in a very important property, which is that of becoming so
luble in ammonia in all proportions, whereas the acid before solution
in the alkali is entirely insoluble in this alkali: these two modifica
tions of metastannic acid evidently differ by a proportion of water;
for when the metastannic acid which is soluble in ammonia is dried,
even at a very gentle heat, it becomes totally insoluble; if also it be
boiled for some time in water, it loses its solubility in ammonia: it
was found impossible to determine the quantity of water retained by
this acid, for the means required to get rid of the hygrometric water
would have destroyed its solubility in ammonia; these acids, how
ever, form similar salts with bases.
   When metastannic acid is heated in concentrated sulphuric acid,
a large quantity is dissolved, and a compound is formed which is very
soluble in alcohol and in water; the aqueous solution is decomposed
by boiling, and precipitates metastannic acid; this acid contains
 19.6 per cent. of water; it is insoluble in ammonia.
   The author concludes, both from the quantity of water and of bases
with which metastannic acid combines, that it is composed of 3 equi
valents of tin and 6 equivalents of oxygen, Snº O'; in this case its
number, hydrogen = 1, will be (tin 174 + oxygen 48) = 222.
 FORMATION AND COMPOSITION                OF CERTAIN METASTAN NATES.
   M. Fremy states that the metastannates of ammonia, potash and
soda are soluble in water, whereas the other metastannates are inso
luble therein; the alkaline metastannates are obtained by the direct
solution of the acid in the bases; the others are prepared by double
decomposition. The soluble metastannates do not crystallize, and
are precipitated by alcohol; great difficulty was experienced by the
author in obtaining these compounds of uniform composition, so as
to determine their equivalent.
   Metastannate of Potash.--To prepare this salt by dissolving the
acid in the alkali, the solution was treated with alcohol, and a gummy
deliquescent precipitate was obtained, which, after washing with al
cohol, was quickly dried between folds of filtering paper, and imme
diately transferred to a vacuum.

   The precipitate is to be diffused through cold water and mixed
with sulphuric acid to precipitate the barytes; and it is better to
leave some digitalate of barytes undecomposed than to add too much
acid.   By filtration a strongly acid, reddish-coloured solution is ob
tained; this is to be slowly distilled in a glass retort in order to se
parate much of the water, and care is to be taken that the heat is
not too great. On cooling, a small quantity of a brown substance
decomposes, the clear liquor is to be poured off, and sufficient alcohol
is to be added to it to precipitate any digitalate of barytes which may
have escaped decomposition; by evaporating the liquor in vacuo,
  crystals are abundantly formed.
     In all these operations it is requisite to avoid the contact of air as
 much as possible, for the digitalic acid is converted by it into a brown
 substance: notwithstanding the evaporation in vacuo, the formation
 of this substance cannot be prevented, and the crystals are conse
 quently formed in a liquid of a deep colour: the more the action of
 the air is prevented, the purer are the crystals obtained. The cry
 stals are to be separated by and pressed between filtering paper, dis
 solved in a small quantity of alcohol, and again crystallized in vacuo,
 by which they are obtained white.
    The properties of digitalic acid thus obtained are, that it crystal
 lizes in long needleform crystals; it possesses a slight peculiar odour,
 which is increased by heat, and it yields a suffocating vapour, a small
 quantity of which occasions coughing; at a higher temperature it
 melts, becomes black, and burns with a white flame; it leaves a
 charcoal which readily burns without residue ; no ammonia is pro
 duced during the decomposition by heat.
    The acid when pure is perfectly white; but the action of light,
 heat and air upon it is very great, readily converting it into a brown
product, which colours the solution, and from which it is difficult to

  PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF CERTAIN DIGITALATES.
  M. Morin states the properties           of  the following digitalates:—
  Digitalate          ofSoda.—Obtained     by  exactly saturating the acid with
                      soda, and evaporating the solution under the air-pump
              It of
carbonate
vacuum.           is    white, and crystallizes very well, but by exposure   to

                    Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                         461
the air it becomes quickly yellow, and so also does the solution.              It
is very soluble in water.
    Digitalate of Potash.-Obtained by decomposing the carbonate in
the same way as the preceding.            It crystallizes with difficulty and is
very soluble in water.
    Digitalate of Magnesia.-Obtained from the acid and carbonate of
magnesia; soluble in water.
    Digitalate of Barytes.—Obtained           by saturating the acid either
with barytes or the carbonate. It is soluble in water, but insoluble
in alcohol and in aether. Quite colourless, but by exposure to air
 and heat it becomes brown.
    Digitalate of Lime is obtained in the same way as the barytic salt,
 with which it has great analogy; being insoluble in alcohol and in
 aether, it may be employed for the preparation of digitalic acid.
     Digitalate of Zinc.—Obtained by treating the carbonate with digi
 talic acid; the filtered solution is to be evaporated by the air-pump
 Vacuum.
     This salt is formed notwithstanding an excess of carbonate. It
 is obtained at first as a transparent salt, having the appearance of a
 thick solution of gum ; but after some days a number of small ar
 borescent crystals are formed. This salt does not so quickly become
 yellow by exposure to the air as those previously described.
     Digitalate of Lead.—A white, heavy, insoluble salt.
     Digitalate of Copper.—A greenish, soluble salt.
     Digitalate of Silver.—A white salt, insoluble in water, but soluble
 in nitric acid.
     A solution of digitalate of soda gives, with protosulphate of iron,
  an abundant flocculent precipitate; with the peracetate of iron it
 produces no effect; these reactions prove, according to the author,
  that digitalic acid cannot be mistaken for gallic acid.
     This acid exists, probably, uncombined with digitalia, for after
  having treated the watery extract with alcohol, an abundant brown
  precipitate is obtained, which is devoid of bitterness, but possesses
  an acid reaction, and digitalic acid may be obtained from                               it.
     M. Morin observes, that the peculiar properties              digitalic acid,

      ON PIAUZITE, A MINERAL RESIN.            BY M. HAIDINGER.
   Colour, blackish-brown; streak, yellowish-brown; massive; lus
tre, resinous; fracture, imperfect conchoidal; translucent on the thin
edges; feeble lustre in cut places; hardness = 1.5; specific - gravity,
1'220.
   Chemical properties.—At about 590°Fahr. it inflames; it burns
at a somewhat higher temperature with a peculiar aromatic smell,
with much flame and soot, leaving an ash. It is completely soluble
in aether and in potash; it is almost entirely soluble in anhydrous
alcohol, but less soluble in alcohol containing water. Fuming nitric
acid converts the colour of the dark brown resin into yellowish
brown.     Heated in a glass tube, there is distilled from it a yellowish
oily fluid, which has an acid reaction. In its common state it con
tains 3-5 per cent. of hygroscopic water; when dry it yields 5-96
per cent. of ash.
   It occurs in veins from one inch to two inches wide, traversing
brown coal and bituminous wood, in a brown coal deposit, in the
neighbourhood of Piauze, north of Newstadtl, in Carniola.
   Its easy inflammability, and the abundance of soot which it depo
sits during burning, cause it to be used for giving the black colour
to cast-iron ware.—Poggendorff’s Annalen. Jameson's Journal.
ON CRYSTALS      IN THE CAVITIES OF TOPAZ. BY SIR. D. BREWSTER.
   The author    gave a brief notice to the British Association of the
discovery which he had made, about twenty years ago, of two new
fluids in the cavities of topaz, and other minerals.
   One of these fluids is very volatile, and so expansible, that it ex
pands twenty times as much as water with some increase of tempe
rature. When the vacuities in the cavity which it occupies are large,
it passes into vapour; and in these different states he had succeeded
in determining its refractive power, by measuring the angles at five
feet.   Total reflexion takes place at the common surface of the fluid
of the topaz. The other fluid is of a denser kind, and occupies the
angles and narrow necks of cavities. The cavities, however, in
 which the soluble crystals are contained, are of a different kind.
They (viz. the cavities) are imperfectly crystallized, and thus they
exist in specimens of topaz which contain the cavities with the two
new fluids; they contain none of the volatile and expansible fluid,
which is doubtless a condensed gas. The crystals which occupy
them are flat and finely crystallized rhomboids.      When heat is ap
plied, they become rounded at their edges and angles, and soon dis
appear.    After the topaz has cooled, they again appear, at first like
a speck, and then recrystallize gradually, sometimes in their original
place, but often in other parts of the cavity, their place being de
termined by the mode in which the cooling is applied.—Jameson's

                           THE LATE PROFESSOR DANIELL.
        Our readers will have heard, with sincere regret, of the sudden
     decease of Professor Daniell of King's College, which took place on
     the 13th of March, whilst he was attending a meeting of the Council
     of the Royal Society.           Our space does not at present permit us to
     insert   any   biographical    sketch of this distinguished philosopher and
     truly excellent man; but it is with pleasure that we have it in our
     power to state, that a subscription has already been entered into to
     do honour to his memory.             On the Committee we see many of the
    personal and scientific friends of the late Professor.                    It is intended
    to execute a bust and establish a chemical                      prize    in connection
    with King's College, the scene of his labours; and subscriptions for
    this purpose, we understand, are received at Lubbock's, at Coutts's,
    and at the Secretary's office in King's College.                  No one more truly
    deserved such a mark of respect than he whom it is thus intended to
    COmmemorate.

LXVII.     On the Interference Spectrum, and the Absorption of
   the Tithonic Rays.       By John WILLIAM DRAPER, M.D.,
   Professor of Chemistry in the University of New York+.
                    are beginning to experience the want of a
CHEMIST's
       nomenclature applicable to the various facts which have
lately been discovered in relation to the action of some of the
imponderable principles. Of these several present themselves
to us under the form of radiations, it being their function to
group and arrange material particles into the various sub
stances which the organic and inorganic kingdoms present.
 We may therefore conveniently class them, as Sir      J.  Herschel
proposes, under the name of actinic forces, and entitle the
science which treats of them actino-chemistry.          For voltaic
currents some other      provision  must be made.
    But the progress of science further requires that a general
nomenclature should be agreed upon, to mark out apparent
subdivisions among these radiant forces. Even though the
separate existence of some of them may not as yet be definitely
proved, we must have provisional terms to designate distinctly
the facts of which we speak.        For want of better, I shall con
tinue to use in this memoir those which I have heretofore em
ployed, and speak of four agents existing in the solar beams:—
 1st, rays of light, or photic rays; 2nd, rays of heat, or thermic
rays; 3rd, tithonic rays; 4th, phosphorogenic rays. The va
rious phaenomena and relations of these constitute the science
of actino-chemistry.
    In the solar spectrum, as formed by the action of a prism,
if we consider any one of the coloured spaces, we cannot define
 with precision effects there taking place without the aid of an
additional nomenclature. Throughout the spectrum each one
of the various radiant principles occurs. In the blue space,
for example, there is light which gives an impression to our
                    .* Communicated by the Author.

466           Prof. Draper on the Interference Spectrum,
visual organs,—heat which disturbs a thermometer,-a tithonic
ray which produces the decomposition of iodide of silver, and
a phosphorogenic ray which causes the sulphuret of lime to
.
glow.     Even after the spectrum region is pointed out, we re
quire for the distinct understanding of the case a further de
termination of the active principle involved; whether it has
       light or heat, tithonicity or the phosphorogenic prin
Clole.
  P.   is well known to the readers of this Journal, I have en
deavoured for some time past to show that the rays occurring
in the sunbeam, and passing now under the names of tithonic
and phosphorogenic, are entitled to be regarded as distinct
imponderable principles.     The main object of the memoirs         I
have published, has been to bring these from their former         ill
defined and indistinct position, and, by giving them specific
designations, to have their title to the same rank as light and
heat recognised by chemists. The names which I have sug
gested might, perhaps, have been amended; but after all it is
with facts that we deal; and, provided our words are eupho
nious, and are connected with no erroneous theories, they may
answer the purpose until the progress of discovery gives us a
clearer view of the whole subject, and enables us to employ
better. It is very probable that other imponderable princi
ples will be recognised, and, for the present, trivial names are
more appropriate for them than theoretical ones.
   In this memoir I propose to confine my observations to the
following propositions:—
   I. To describe the photographic and tithonographic phae
nomena of the interference spectrum, and to suggest there
from a suitable subnomenclature for actino-chemistry.
   II.  To determine the laws of absorption of the tithonic rays.
   As the laws of absorption are at the foundation of actino
chemistry, I shall consider this latter proposition under two
heads:—1st, to determine the changes which the ray itself un
dergoes; 2nd, to determine the changes which happen to the
ponderable matter or sentient surface. These observations
will, for the present, be limited to tithonic, photic, and thermic
absorption. Of phosphorogenic absorption I shall speak here
                                                                  -

   I. Phaenomena of the Interference Spectrum.—The prismatic
spectrum, even when every precaution has been used to obtain
it in a state of purity,    its
                            fixed lines being visible,  liable
                                                           is      to
lead      into many errors.

properties, we cannot determine the distribution       intensity
                                                        or
of  the light, because the violet extremity      unduly dilated.

As       respects          its
                    tithonic effects the same difficulty occurs, for
these are necessarily controlled and disturbed                       the law                      by                    of

     When, therefore, we have any tithonic, photic, thermic,
 phosphorogenic, or any other actinic effect under discussion,
 in relation to the spectrum, we have only to determine its
 place among the fixed lines, remembering in the interference
 spectrum the simple law that connects the deviations and wave
 lengths.          In the mode of operating here described, absolute
 exactitude is not reached, because our measures are obtained
 from a flat surface and not upon a circular arc.
     To the interference spectrum thus formed, I exposed for
  half an hour a Daguerreotype plate, rendered sensitive by
  iodine and then by bromine.                     It resulted that the bromide of
  silver is     decomposed           at a maximum by a wave of tithonicity,
  which is 0.00001588 of a Paris inch in length.                           The action
  does not extend equally, as we might have supposed, towards
  the more and less refrangible regions.
      I  exposed a silver plate which had been prepared by iodine,
  bromine and chloride of iodine successively.                           The point of
  maximum           fell, as   before,   at 0:00001538.           The time of expo
  sure one hour.            The decomposition commenced by a wave in
  the green space, the length of which was 0.00002007, and was
  terminated by one in the violet, whose length was 0.00001257.
   The point of maximum action, therefore, inclined to the violet,
   and was not midway between the extremities of the tithono
   graph. The absolute length of the stain depends however on
   the time of exposure.
      I   need not multiply these results.                     It is sufficient to add,
   that in several trials I obtained, in these apparently delicate
   experiments, tithonographs of the interference spectrum, on
   different surfaces, in great perfection. The fixed lines, which
   are crowded close together, were beautifully distinct.
       I would suggest, therefore, that when we wish to indicate
   spectrum regions with precision, we should use wave-lengths.
   By doing this we shall connect the various actinic phaenomena,
   —whether they refer to light, heat, tithonic, or phosphorogenic
   rays, with a great many of the numerical results of optics,
   and have fixed points of comparison.

   And further, that when we design to speak less exactly, or
merely to indicate in a general way the region to which we
refer, we should use the well-known colour designations: thus
we might speak of tithonic blue rays, phosphorogenic violet,
photic yellow, or thermic red; pointing out at once the im
ponderable principle in action and the spectrum region it oc
cupies.
     II. Laws of Absorption of the Tithonic Rays.—There is a
very great misconception respecting the mechanical force of
the tithonic rays. Thus those which come from a candle or
other artificial light, are regarded as being exceedingly feeble,
and able only to produce an insignificant result.                  took a                  I
nitric acid battery, of Prof. Grove’s construction; it was suf
ficiently powerful to maintain a platina wire white hot, and
decompose muriatic acid with great activity.             It was evolving,
as Dr. Faraday has made probable, as much electricity as
could be found in a thunder-cloud, and yet the rays of a com
mon wax candle could recompose the muriatic acid faster than
the battery could decompose                      it.
    When      beam
                a        light has fallen on any changeable surface,

           as

   CASE of THE CHRYSoTYPE.-The sensitive material em
ployed in this process is the ammonio-citrate of iron, a solu
tion, which, when viewed through a small thickness, is of a
yellow colour.
   Prismatic analysis of the Chrysotype.—I projected a motion
less spectrum on chrysotype paper, and speedily obtained an
impression of a pale brown colour, which, when brought out
by neutral chloride of gold, was found to extend from about
the fixed line F, to beyond the violet extremity,
    Having passed a beam from a heliostat through a trough
with parallel sides, containing a solution of the ammonio-ci
trate of such a strength, and in a stratum of such a thickness,
as to appear of a bright yellow colour,               I
                                                   received     spectrum   its
 on  chrysotype paper. For         a  long time the paper remained
unchanged, but after          an
                               hour's exposure         was able

                                               which was nearly upon
the line   F, and the stain extended           little above and below
                                                 a

    On considering these two results,              will appear that the

                          a                      of

take place      in chrysotype paper             by

through   a  sufficient thickness       of

cause the active ones have been        absorbed,     and are already   ex
pended    in effecting the required decomposition.
    The same conclusion was arrived                  at     by
                                                       experimenting                     in
the following way:—I prepared              sensitive plate
                                            a                   exposure   by
                                                This gives,
                                                                                be as
to  iodine and bromine successively.                                  well          is
known, very changeable surface. Such plate may
          a                                            a           called,
for the sake       distinction,
                    of             test-plate.
                                   a
   On this    test-plate  I   received      spectrum formed from
                                             a                                           a
beam which had passed          through    the trough containing am
monio-citrate        of
                     iron.    After     asuitable exposure       found I                 a
tithonograph extending from the extreme red slightly beyond
the fixed line       F. But we have already seen that the active
chrysotype rays extend from about               F the end
                                                     to                of
                                                              the violet.
Consequently, those rays which affect the test-plate after ab
sorption are complementary            those which affect the chryso
                                       to
type. The following conclusions may therefore                 drawn:—  be
   1st. That the rays which escape absorption                the ammo by
nio-citrate     of
                 iron are precisely those which do not affect                            it
chemically.
   2nd. That the rays which are absorbed                         by
                                                          the ammonio
citrate   ofiron are the rays which produce chemical changes
in it.

     CASE of THE BICHRomate of PotAsH.—A piece of paper
  dipped in a solution of this salt turns brown rapidly on expo
  sure to the sun's rays; but if there be placed before it a trough
  containing a solution of the salt, the change then goes on very
 slowly.
     Prismatic analysis of this case.—On projecting a motionless
 spectrum on this paper, an impression was obtained in a
 quarter of an hour, reaching from a line a little beyond the
 fixed line D, which I will provisionally call a, to the violet
 extremity.
     A trough with parallel sides filled with a solution of the
 salt was next interposed in the beam, and the resulting spec
 trum received on a bromoiodized plate. The tithonograph
 extended from the red extremity to the line w. The use here
 made of the bromide of silver as a test-surface was originally
 pointed out by Sir           J.
                         Herschel.
     From this we   may draw the same conclusions which we met
 in the case of the chrysotype; they are as follows:—
     1st. When a ray impinges on a sensitive surface, or passes
 through a changeable medium, with the chemical effect which
 takes place the constitution of the ray is correspondingly dis
 turbed.   A change in the composition of the medium involves a
 change in the ray.   A specific detithonization of the ray is the
 necessary attendant on a chemical change in the medium.
    2nd, Itays which thus disappear by absorption are occupied
 in disturbing the constitution of the ponderable medium.
    3rd. Rays which have                detithonised or inactive, with
                                    become
  respect to a given medium, and which are therefore not involved
  in changes going on in           it,
                                 escape           by
                                              being transmitted           re          or
jlected.

sink to different depths, because the quality of coloration
which they possess enables them to absorb heat more or less
rapidly, and the calorific effect is determined by the optical
constitution.
     In the same manner, in another branch of actino-chemistry,
PHoTIc ABsorption; —the law under which the discharge of
vegetable colours in the solar spectrum takes place has not
escaped the penetration of Sir J. Herschel, who has furnished
us with so much that is new in this department of science.
 “The rays effective in destroying a given tint are in a great
many cases those whose union produces a colour comple
 mentary to the tint destroyed, or at least one belonging to that
 class of colours to which such a complementary tint may be
 referred '' (Phil. Trans., 1842, p. 189).
      Now this is nothing more than an expression of a particular
 case of absorptive decomposition, in which light is the agent,
 and vegetable matter the substance involved. The reason
 that a yellow substance is bleached by the blue rays, is be
 cause it absorbs those rays; for the very same reason there
 fore that it looks yellow. A purple vegetable body is bleached
 by the yellow and green rays, and because it absorbs those rays
 it looks purple.
      As respects light, the phaenomena of coloration are obvious
 to our organs of vision; as respects the dark beam of heat, of
 tithonicity, and of phosphorescence, they must be hypothetical
 or ideal; but in the same manner that Melloni has found the
 admission of them for the calorific rays of such admirable ad
 vantage, so in this department of science similar and palpable
 advantages arise.      Who could for a moment doubt that light
 and the tithonic rays were agents totally distinct, as soon as
 he came to understand that to one of them iodide of silver is
 yellow, to the other orange; to one chloride of silver is white,
  to the other red; to one bromide of silver is white, to the
 other it is black?
      On this subject of ideal or imaginary coloration, I do not at
 present propose to enlarge; on a future occasion        I shall re
 turn to 11.
      Let us now investigate the changes which take place in the
  sensitive body.    The substance I have used is a mixture of
  chlorine and hydrogen, one of the most sensitive combinations
  known.
      When a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen is exposed in a
  tithonometer to the rays of an Argand lamp, with due pre
  cautions to ensure a correct result, four distinct periods of
  action may be traced.
      1st. For a brief space the mixture expands.

   2nd. For a much longer period it then remains wholly sta
tionary, neither expanding nor contracting, though the rays
are constantly falling on it and it is absorbing them.
   3rd. Contraction arising from the production of muriatic
acid begins, commencing at first slowly, and then more and
more rapidly.
   4th. And, after that contraction has fairly set       goes                                      in,it               on

the same relation, can exert no action on each other, even

fall in the yellow space, and the yellow, for that reason, be
come the active ray in decomposing carbonic acid, and giving
a green colour to leaves? Is it for this cause, also, that re
ceived into the eye, the yellow ray impresses us with the great
est illuminating power?        It would be a beautiful result to co
ordinate    phaenomena    apparently    so widely apart as the form
ation of   chlorophyll  in a  leaf, and the regulated destruction of
the retina in the chamber of the human eye in producing the
phaenomena of vision. In nature there are many results which
are apparently equally distinct, and which the progress of
knowledge has shown are intimately allied.                That to our
organs of vision yellow light is the most brilliant, arises from
 the incidental circumstance, that it is a carbonaceous com
 pound of which the changing nervous expansion is constructed.
 Had it been possible for nature to have formed a retina in
 which a salt of silver formed the basis, the maximum of bril
 liancy of light would have shifted, and the blues would have
 been among the brightest rays.          Is it in the optical peculiari

   the second volume of the third edition of my Traité

mission to lay before the Academy various applications of a

   The problem which this theory solves consists in determi

rays through any number of spherical surfaces, either refract
ing or reflecting, centred on the same axis, and separated by
singly-refracting media, of whatever nature, when the inclina
tions of the rays to the central axis are very small. This enun

that for a like total even number of surfaces the number of
terms is reduced to one-half.       Under this new form all the
effects of any dioptric system are found still to depend solely
on four principal coefficients, connected by one equation of
condition.     I deduce these four coefficients, both in the gene
ral and in the simple case, from one amongst them, by a simple
process of differentiation; and                       I
                                    afterwards lay down a gene
ral analytical rule, by which we directly obtain this coefficient
from which the three others are derived.         The path of the
 rays in any optical system is thus completely determined by
 the explicit expressions of the four principal coefficients, in
 which we have only to substitute numbers for each system of
 given construction.    I have collected these results, relative to
 systems purely dioptric, in a table which expresses explicitly
allall
     their effects, and   which may     inintroduced immediately

that it is confined within extremely narrow limits, between
absolute equality of the two radii (which would put the poste
rior surface of the crown-glass in contact with the anterior of the
flint), and a very small difference of length (which would sepa
rate by a very minute quantity the margins of the two sur
faces).      The combinations comprised between these two limits
are therefore the only ones which it is suitable to choose, and
it appears that they must be nearly equivalent in effectiveness,
when we thus confine ourselves to the destruction of the first
term of the two aberrations.          All give the flint concave in the
interior and convex on the exterior. This is precisely the con
figuration which Fraunhofer adopted, and which he always
combined with the nullity of the interval between the two
lenses.      But the agreement of analytic theory with the prac
tical combinations of this great artist, is seen to be still much
more close when it is followed out in numbers. For, starting

  After having developed this important application, I re
sume the general formulae peculiar to dioptric systems, and I
employ them to establish the theory of eye-pieces applied to
achromatic object-glasses. I limit them to the usual case, in
which the component lenses of these eye-pieces are made of
glasses   of the same kind, and                             I

ties of their effects.       I then    apply  the same formulae to the
analysis of the night glasses employed as finders, to that of the
day or long-sight glasses, in which the objects are seen erect,

     I
     have performed alone the numerous numerical calculations
which are given in this volume and in the preceding one.
Although    I have made them with care, and most of them se
veral times,  I cannot be sure that some errors of detail have
not escaped me. But the attentive reader, who must consider
them only as examples, will, as he proceeds, himself find op
portunities of correcting them.     I have more reason to fear
the errors which may have escaped me in the analytical for
mulae, on account of the general influence which they might
have upon the applications of them.    But a person well-versed
in analysis, and  very skilful in discovering  the errors of the
expressions which it employs, M. Yvon Villarçeau, has had the
kindness to revise attentively the formulae which this volume
contains, and to point out to me the inaccuracies which had
escaped in the printing.            I
                               have rectified those which were
reparable, and which might most easily have misled. I have
indicated in an erratum others which, notwithstanding their
obviousness, might embarrass the reader for a moment, re
questing him to take the trouble to correct them before read
ing the work, and especially before making any applications
of it.

have the dissatisfaction of resting in a conclusion manifestly
opposed to one's common sense notions, which it must be                                                              re
membered may indeed fail to conduct us to the truth, but can
not mislead us.
   A full investigation of the subject is therefore necessary;
and if there be some to whom this discussion may appear of
obscure interest, I would observe that we shall be led by it
not merely to settle the point immediately at issue, but to ex
pose the       ài.   of principles and results now universally re
ceived and occasionally of the utmost importance, and to give
to a great branch of mathematical inquiry a degree of truth
and certainty which it has never hitherto possessed.
   The conclusion that sin oo and cos on represent indefinite

and this quite independently of n, whence it is clear that the
proposed series has three values, a, a + b, a + b + c, and is not
equivalent to the mean of those quantities.
   It is plain, therefore, that this supposed illustration does
not bear out the principle it is adduced to support.
   Mr. De Morgan proceeds to say, “2. In applying Fou
rier's theorem (p. 629) to discontinuous functions, we find
that at the point where the discontinuity takes place, and a
function which generally can have but one value might be ex
pected to take two, it takes neither, and gives only the mean
between them.”
   It will take some trouble to unravel the maze of errors                                                  in
volved in the above short sentence.
   Recurring to p. 629 of Mr. De Morgan's treatise, we find
                                               -
him there proposing to find, by means of Fourier's theorem,
“a function of a which is      a from a = 0 to a = 1 and = 0
everywhere else;” and he actually finds a function which he
believes (most mistakenly) to satisfy the conditions in gene
ral, but which at the limit when was 1, instead of giving was 1,
                                                             -                     l
or a = 0, or both these values, gives                                  w    =      Tº

ster up his verification of his function by the supposed author

it is necessary that I should show the fallacy of the theorem

so that    AO X =        B O X = tan-'a;            then it is clear that the
equation                        y = & a sin oo
indicates that the point of which y is the ordinate is situate
somewhere within one of the angles A O B, Al O B (the sides
produced indefinitely); or in other words, y = x a sin oo is
the equation to the surface included in those angles.
    In like manner the two equations,
                      = a a sin o,               w = a sin oc,

    At the time of writing the above paper, the subject of which had been
 long before me, I was not aware that my friend Mr. Earnshaw had com
 municated to the Cambridge Philosophical Society a paper on the same
 subject, which has since been published. Our methods of treating the
 subject, however, are so different, that I have thought it not unadvisable
 to communicate the above. I cannot help observing, en passant, that Mr.
Earnshaw seems to treat the crude notions which have been put forth on
 this subject, with far more respect than they deserve.

 THE      and general interest in the scientific world, that a by
 stander, incompetent to the discussion of the entire subject,
 may perhaps be permitted to make a suggestion or two in
 reference to a particular point.               If  this indulgence is con
 ceded, I would venture to ask,
     I. Whether the plasticity, so strongly indicated by the
 phaenomena which attend the movement of glaciers, and yet
 so little in accordance with the properties of ice as exhibited
  under ordinary circumstances, may be due wholly or in part
  to the influence of heat developed by intense local pressure?
  That the pressure in the interior of a moving glacier must in
  many cases be not only very great but very unequally distri
  buted is quite clear; and the friction, when disruption takes

resemblance which may confirm the supposition that there is affinity
between them, or whether, on the contrary, a sufficient degree of
dissimilarity can be made out, from an accurate examination, to en
title us to set them down as separate races, and to class them with
different grand divisions of the human species; whether, in short,
these differences, if any such are found, are more than can be ac
counted for by the diversity of climate and modes of life which are
well known long to have existed between them.
    The examination of these skulls for the purpose of furnishing an
 accurate description of their appearance is interesting in another
point of view. In Scandinavia and in Denmark there are numerous
tumuli which contain osteological remains of former inhabitants, and
 it is a disputed point whether they are the remains of a Finnish ab
 original stock or of Cimbrian or some unknown race, since they differ
 from the old German remains.        Now if we could establish a correct
notion of the Finnish    description   of skull, we should have no diffi
 culty in deciding whether the remains before mentioned belonged to
this stock.
    Having four specimens of these skulls, two of Finns and two of
 Laplanders, which my father has received through the kindness of
 Dr. Ilmoni and Mr. Daniel Wheeler, of Bristol, I have an opportunity
 of examining their peculiarities and of comparing them with each
 other and with the skulls of other Europeans, Chinese, American
 Indian, and the Esquimaux, the latter of which is a most remarkable
 specimen of the pyramidal and broad-faced skull.
     Upon taking a general view of these skulls, there are no remark
 able features which strike us so forcibly as those which we see in the
 conformation of the Esquimaux.         In fact, the only point worthy of
 notice here, before we commence the particular description, is a de
 gree of general breadth in the face superior to that which is seen in
 the European generally, which gives to the whole an appearance of
 squareness when the lower jaw is attached, and causes the actual
 shortness of the face, which is remarkable in these skulls, to become
 still more apparent. The general resemblance between the Finnish
 skulls and those of the Lappes is as strong as between four average
 European crania, even belonging to the same nation, and altogether
 their contour decidedly approaches what Blumenbach calls the Mon
  golian form of skull, the head appearing, as it has been noticed by
 an ocular observer, “of the shape of a pent-house.’
     It will be found, however, that it is more especially in a close
 and minute examination that differences are seen to exist between
 the Lappes and Finns on the one hand, and the European skulls on
 the other.
     Viewed from above and behind, there is a slight difference obser
 vable between the Finn and the Lappe: the posterior part of the Lappe
 is larger than the anterior, while the form of the Finn is more regu
 lar and rounded; that   is, the line between the parietal protuberances
 exceeds the transverse diameter    of    the forehead more in  the Lappe
           the Finn.     find, however, that there        equal difference
                                                    of is
 than in            I

        Dr. Prichard       on the         Crania of the Finns and Lappes. 499
 Again, from the       same point   of view the skulls of the Lappes present
  a central eminence or     ridge,   upon looking at the outline of the fore
 head   (being the line of  junction    of the two halves of the frontal bone),
  which is much less      marked,    in fact scarcely discernible in the Finn,
 and   altogether   absent in the European, being on the contrary very
  strikingly prominent in the Esquimaux.           Examined anteriorly, how
 ever, a general view of these skulls gives us exactly opposite results;
 for the sagittal suture, which is now the median line, and the con
 tinuation backwards of the frontal suture of early life, upon looking
 at the outline or horizon of the skull, is seen to project decidedly
 more in the Finn than in the Lappe; in both more than in other
 Europeans.       Hence we may fairly lay down, that the skulls of the
 Finns and    Lappes    have (as far only as the vault of the cranium, ex
 clusive of  any   effect produced by the width of the face, allows us to
 conclude,) more tendency to the pyramidal form than the European,
 but less than the Esquimaux.
    Examining these skulls anteriorly, taking into consideration the
 face, the triangular form is very evident, partly in consequence of
 the fact above mentioned respecting the vault of the cranium, and
 partly in consequence of the great width between the external sur
 faces of the malar bones, which in actual measurement in the two
 Lappes and the two Finns exceeds the length of the same diameter
in other Europeans by at least half an inch, and in one case by nearly
 an inch, being equal to the same diameter in the Esquimaux; in the
latter, however, which exhibits the pyramidal shape in a remarkable
degree, the form is owing as much to the shape of the forehead as
to the lateral projection of the anterior roots of the zygomatic pro
cesses.     This width across the face               is,

the superciliary ridges are well-marked, the ossa nasi, and the ascend
ing processes of the superior maxillary bones present a flatter and
broader anterior surface than the European, and the cavities and fora
mina are well-marked.           [In all these four skulls the supraorbital
opening for the frontal nerve and artery is a complete foramen upon
the left side, and merely a notch upon the right.]
    In consequence of the greater width of the superior maxillary
bone, the shape of the circumference of the orbit is not so round as in
the generality of European skulls, where the external inferior angle
is the lowest, but it is square, with the angles rounded; and for the
 same reason the space for the antrum is increased, while the depth
of the infraorbital or canine fossa is very materially decreased: in
 one of the Finnish skulls this surface, from the inferior edge of the
 orbit to the alveolar processes, is almost plane. There is nothing
remarkable in the nasal aperture. The shape of the orbit differs
 materially from that of the Esquimaux, where it is almost round, and
from that in the skull of an Indian of the Sioux tribe, where it much
resembles the European.
    The distance from the inferior edge of the nasal aperture, that                                    is,

    The general shape           the head resembles that         the European          of
 anteriorly, but the posterior part does not project         much. There         so                    is
a   marked difference between the posterior projection              the Finns               of

as we observe    in the English, Irish, ancient Irish (cast), Sioux,
Italian and Mulatto skulls. The only ones which have this character
in common with the Lappes and Finns are the Negro and the skull
of a Hindu.
   The angle of the lower jaw is certainly more obtuse, seen upon
comparing skulls in which the molar teeth remain perfect.      In the
form and direction of the coronoid process there seems to be no great
difference.
   The temporal fossae are well-marked, and in one of the Finnish
skulls the anterior inferior angles of the parietal bones are connected
to the great wings of the sphenoid by means of an os wormianum
upon either side. This is not unfrequently the case in other crania.
   The general shortness of the face which has been observed to exist
in these skulls, is more plainly seen by viewing them from the side,
when we find that the inferior edge of the malar bone is very little
higher than the edge of the alveolar process. This is owing not so
much to the want of development downwards of these processes,
although I have already noticed the shortness of the space between
the nose and the mouth, but to the great breadth (from above down
wards) of the malar bone, measured from           free inferior border         its                                      to

  The glenoid cavities are flatter, more widely separated, and not
so well-defined as in the European generally, and a difference corre
sponding to this is seen in the lower jaw, where the condyles, besides
being more widely separated from one another, are also more rounded
in form, allowing of a greater degree of lateral motion. In corre
spondence with this fact we also find that the pterygoid processes of
the sphenoid bone, especially the external plates, are widened and
 enlarged, extending farther outwards, affording a greater space for
the attachment of the pterygoid muscles, whose duty it is to perform
 the lateral or grinding motion in mastication.         I mentioned above
 the corresponding fact of the teeth being much worn down.
    The ridges for the attachment of the muscles on the palate bone
 are well-marked, and viewed from below it is seen that the alveolar
 processes do not project so much from the horizontal part of the
 palate; that      is,
                   that the entire hard palate presents general curve             a

The small quantity of hydrobromic acid observed in this ac
tion of bromine on chlorisatine may have arisen from a small
admixture of isatine, which would be converted into bromisa
tine. By continued action of bromine in sunshine, perhaps -
another result might be obtained.

   It has been already stated that aniline is decomposed with
facility by bromine.    On adding bromine water to the solu
tion of a salt of chloraniline, a white precipitate takes place,
which dissolves in boiling alcohol, producing a slight violet
colour, and crystallizes on cooling in needles.       The same
 compound can be obtained by the direct action of bromine on
chloraniline. On adding bromine to the crystals of the latter,
a very violent reaction takes place, with great elevation of
temperature and evolution of hydrobromic acid, the mixture
at the same time assuming a violet colour.     Bromine is to be
added till the mass on being fused no longer absorbs any
more. The crystalline product is then to be allowed to cool,

relation between the axes:—b: a c= 1 : 0.989 : 0.843, and
the angle between the axes c and b-72°20'.
   This salt is isomorphous with the hydrochlorate of chlorani
line. It belongs to the same crystalline system, and is formed
by the same planes. Still the character is somewhat differ
ent, viz. the crystals are less extended in the direction of the
axis b, so that the horizontal edge, in which the two planes a
cut each other, disappear, and the two planes d with the two
g form a four-sided summit: the angle of the prism 2 g : 2 g was
found here = 127° 48'. The angles of this salt however can
not be so well measured as in the analogous one.
   The analysis of the hydrochlorate of bromaniline gave the
following results:—
   1°1425 grm. of the salt gave 0.798 grim. of chloride of silver.

                        b. Properties           of Dibromaniline.
   These       I
             have not as yet very carefully studied.  They re
semble in many respects those of bromaniline.      The crystals
of this body, however, have a totally different form. It does
not crystallize in octahedrons as the bromaniline, but in flat,
four-sided, rhombic prisms of considerable size, which unfor
tunately present no terminal planes.
    The base is soluble in spirits of wine and yields successive
crops of crystals to the last drop.       It is only slightly soluble
in   boiling  water,   which becomes turbid on cooling, and de
posits gradually fine white needles. The crystals of the base
melt, between 50° and 60° cent, to a dark oily fluid, which
frequently on cooling remains long liquid, but on agitation
suddenly solidifies to a crystalline mass.
    A solution of the base in acids communicates, like aniline,
a  yellow   colour to fir-wood and the pith of the elder tree.
    The   compounds     of dibromaniline have likewise as yet not
been the object of particular study.          I will only mention a
few observations which appeared to me essential to the esta
blishment of the chemical characters of dibromaniline.
    It possesses the properties of a base;                      its
                                                   basic character

however much less pronounced than that               bromaniline.of

ganic bases.          forms with acids
                       It                crystalline   salts, but these
compounds possess much less stability than the correspond
ing salts      of
               bromaniline.
  A    solution        of
                    the base     boiling hydrochloric acid deposits
                                          in

                        these crystals, precipitated with nitrate                               of
silver, gave 0-1205 grim,        chloride of               of

   This compound has been long since described by Fritzsche”
and named by him bromaniloid.        He obtained it by treating
aniline with bromine.     It forms with the same facility by the
action of the same   body  on bromaniline or dibromaniline.
     I
     have prepared this body from bromaniline.     The hydro
chlorate of this base gives with a solution of bromine in water
a white precipitate with a tint of violet. As the violet colour
did not disappear by re-crystallization from alcohol, I sub
mitted the compound to distillation.     At the commencement
of the distillation there are condensed in the receiver beau
tiful snow-white crystals; towards the end however the violet
accessory product also passed over, and could not be re
moved again by recrystallization from alcohol.    Although the
properties and mode of formation of this body left no doubt of
of its
    identity with bromaniloid,    however made      combustion

   We now return to the question, can chlorine play the part
of hydrogen in organic compounds?
   The isatine group is perhaps quite capable of affording
some explanation of this question.
   In isatine we have a body which, by the action of chlorine,
loses one or more equivalents of hydrogen, which are replaced
by the acting substance. These three compounds, isatine,
chlorisatine and dichlorisatine, possess the same chemical and
physical properties.   By the substitution of chlorine for hy
drogen the character of isatine has not been changed. Isatine,
chlorisatine and dichlorisatine, by the action of other agents,
suffered similar changes.     By treatment with sulphuret of
ammonium we see these three bodies assuming one equivalent
of hydrogen and changing into isatyd, chlorisatyd and dichlo
risatyd. By proper treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen the
whole or part of the oxygen can be eliminated and replaced
by sulphur.    In contact with alkaline sulphates the sulpho
isatinic and chlorisatinic salts are formed; peculiar com
pounds, in which the sulphurous acid is united in a singular
manner with the organic substance. The behaviour of isatine
and chlorisatine to ammonia and alkalies is also similar: par
ticularly towards the latter the analogy in their action is in the
highest degree characteristic.     At the ordinary temperature
they unite directly with the alkalies, but at a boiling heat
they change into isatinic and chlorisatinic acid, whose strict
analogy in    all
                these salts never fails,  Finally,    fusion with by
hydrate  of  potash, we see isatine converted into aniline; when
chlorisatine  is treated in  the same manner, still under con
ditions which certainly are favourable      fix the chlorine, this

element is observed to pass over into the new compound.
From the fused hydrate of potash, which retains a portion of
the carbon of chlorisatine in the form of carbonic acid, there
distils over chloraniline, and with it the whole of the chlorine
existing in the former compound.       In the present memoir                                              I
have had frequent occasion to show the analogy which exists
between aniline and the chlorinated base; it extends not
º
only to the fundamental properties of both bodies, but even to
the products of decomposition.     By the action of bromine on
aniline tribromaniline                   is formed,         cº<U+017F>; }N.                     with the   chlo

 518      Prof. De Morgan on the almost total Disappearance
 able,  if we remember that he held the chair of mathematics at
 Wittemberg, in which Luther had very lately taught theology,
 and burned the pope's bull, and in which Melancthon actually
 taught Greek. Riccioli very gravely informs us that Rheticus
 received a supernatural punishment for his presumption.
 While he was puzzling himself about the motion of Mars, he
 invoked his genius or guardian angel to help him out of the
 difficulty: the angel accordingly lifted him up by the hair of
 his head to the roof and threw him down upon the pavement,
 saying with a bitter laugh, “That’s the way Mars moves.”
 Kepler, it seems, had heard this story with such evidence as
 induced him to suppose that Rheticus must have knocked his
 head against the wall in the agitation of his spirits.              Riccioli
 does not feel himself at liberty to make any other mention of
 him, and adds damnatus auctor to his name, in a list in which
 Copernicus himself figures without remark: and Clavius, in
 the diffuse trigonometry attached to the edition of Theodosius,
 does not even introduce his name, The Jesuit Blancanus,
 also, in his list of mathematicians, excludes Rheticus altogether,
though he was a contemporary of the Opus Palatinum, and
though he admits Copernicus.
    The works of Rheticus are accordingly very scarce; and
it can be no matter of surprise that one of them, and perhaps
more, should have entirely slipped out of notice.                   Even the
second edition of Copernicus, Basle, 1566, which was edited
by Rheticus, is much more scarce than the first.
    The early history of trigonometrical tables, as given, may
be thus summed up. Tables of sines, which were substituted
for Ptolemy's chords by Albategnius, were published, to every
minute, from Regiomontanus+ (who died in 1476), and also
by Apian, both in 1533. Regiomontanus used tangents, as
the Arabs had done before him, and there is a table, to de
grees only, in a work of his published by Reinhold in 1561.
This same Erasmus Reinhold had printed tangents of every
   * Such is the statement: but on examining the work on triangles by
Regiomontanus, in which these sines are said to occur, and which was
published in 1533,    I cannot find any table at all. But Apian published
two tables of sines: one in the Introductio Geographica, 1533, and another
in the Instrumentum primi mobilis, 1534. There is a table of sines in the
 Tabulae Directionum, 1552, and another in the second edition of the work
JDe Triangulis, Basle, 1561, folio. And in the catalogue of De Thou's
library, and in Niceron's list, Murhard's catalogue, and Kästner's history, is
mentioned the following work, “Joh. Regiomontani compositio tabularum
Sinuum, cum tabulis duplicibus Sinuum ejusdem,” folio, Nuremberg, 1541.
All the writers who assert that sines of Regiomontanus were published be
fore those of Apian, go on the assumption that what is in the second edition
of the work on triangles is also in the first, which assumption is not true,
Lalande gives a wrong date, place and title, to this first edition.

minute, in his Liber Tabularum Directionum, published in
1554, three years after the Prutenic tables, on which his fame
principally rests.     Regiomontanus had called the table of tan
gents canon foecundus, which name Reinhold adopted. As to
secants, the table of which was afterwards called canon foecun
dissimus, a name which                     I
                               think first occurs in Vieta, the first
table mentioned is that of Maurolycus in the spherical treatise
which accompanies his edition of Theodosius and Menelaus,
published in 1558; this table goes only to degrees, and is
called tabula benefica. The Canon Mathematicus of Vieta, pub
lished in 1579, is said to have been the first work in which sines,
tangents, and secants were joined together; that                  the first                 is,

died   in 1576, had very nearly completed the enormous table
which Valentine Otho published              1596, under the name

520     Prof. De Morgan on the almost total Disappearance
the latter, expresses a great desire to see a certain little book
of Rheticus, the title of which he does not mention. In a
subsequent letter of 1595, he reports that he has seen this
 book, that it treats only of plane triangles, and that it strives
at (nititur) the canon of triangles which Rheticus afterwards
 (olim) published.       What can this canon of triangles be? At
 the date of this last letter, the Opus Palatinum was not pub
lished.     It can refer to nothing but the work which              now                     I
bring forward, and which, it thus appears, was known. The
next witness I shall cite is Thomas Digges, who is likely to
have taken a particular interest in the writings of his fellow
 Copernican.       In the Alae seu Scala, Mathematica, published
in   1573,  during   the life of Rheticus, Digges says that those
 who dislike labour should consult the tables of the proportions
of right-angled triangles by Rheticus, of which tables he fur
 ther states that they go to every ten minutes.
    Valentine Otho, in the preface to the Opus Palatinum, says
 that “when Rheticus gave to the public a specimen of his me
 thod of enriching the canon and doctrine of triangles, he ex
 cited a wonderful degree of hope and expectation about it in
the minds of the learned, especially when in the dialogue
which he prefixed to his ten-minute canon, he brought for
ward extraordinary and almost incredible things concerning
its  use.”  I   produce       the Society the ten-minute canon with
                               to
the dialogue, which however            not prefixed
                                             is          the table, but  to
follows     it.  Otho afterwards mentions this        dialogue    again,
and   says  that     on
                      reading        was    he            so
                                              struck with the   preten

                of                                    He further adds,
 that at  their first meeting, when                  he
                                           had just stated that     was                     he

 Rheticus interrupted him with, “You are just             old       was      as        as
                                                                                        I
 when I    went on the same errand            Copernicus.”to    Thus                             it
appears that this canon was the indirect cause            the publica     of

first half, and so on. But the very reverse is the fact; the
names cosine, cotangent and cosecant, are the consequence,
not the cause, of this duplicate system of arguments. Rheticus
made his arrangement with a view to separate from each other
all the cases    which the greater side and the less side were
                       in
data.   This involved the bringing into the same line the tan
gent     each angle with the tangent
        of                                      complement, and     of       its
the same for the secant.       Completeness   then required that
the same should be done with the sine.      The introduction                                           of

taught at Paris, but was prevented by being obliged to learn
and practise medicine in the stead of a certain patron, Macce
 natis cujusdam loco.                          I
                         What this ineans do not know : per
 haps loco is a misprint for domo. Though Otho does not
 mention that Rheticus practised medicine, he to a certain ex
 tent confirms Ramus, by stating that his friend died at Cassau,
in Hungary, on his way home, after being called out by a
certain baron.    I   mention these things, because it is never
 stated that Rheticus was a physician. He died in 1576, in
 the sixty-first year of his age.
    With regard to the choice of intervals of ten minutes, it may
have been dictated by the existing state of astronomy; but it
is more than likely that Copernicus was the suggester of the
 arrangement.     Rheticus has preserved it as a saying of Co
pernicus, that if he could only succeed in giving planetary
tables which should be true within ten minutes, he should
feel as much gratified as Pythagoras, when he discovered the
great property of the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle.
    In this communication I have confined myself to points
which are either new, or very little known.
more circumstance of the latter kind.
                                                      I
                                                    will add one
  I   have noted that Rheticus stands in the Indew as damnatus
auctor, while Copernicus is damnati libri auctor: a material
difference.    But perhaps it may suggest itself to some that
Copernicus is only the writer of one work, which, being
condemned, makes him a condemned author; and that it
would not be thought necessary to condemn, in general terms,
a writer all whose works can be prohibited under one title.
But, not to dwell here upon such a supposition really imply
ing an ignorance of the usage, it is not true that Copernicus
wrote and published only one work.       Though it be but little
known, and not mentioned by any of the French school of
historians, it is certain that Rheticus himself published (Wit
temberg, 1542) in 4to the “De lateribus et angulis triangu
lorum tum planorum rectilineorum, tum sphaericorum libellus,”
containing a table of sines to every minute, and to a radius of
ten millions, or as we should now say, to seven decimals.
    This work is mentioned by Weidler, who, though of             Wit
temberg, had no knowledge of it till he published the supple
ments of his history: it is catalogued by Murhard, and de
scribed by Kästner. The great work De Revolutionibus, pub
lished the next year, contains a probably abridged treatise on
triangles, and a certainly abridged table of sines.
    In speaking of the great work of Copernicus, it should be
remembered that Rheticus procured            its
                                            publication,      ex or

256            Capt. Newbold on a recent Fossil Freshwater Deposit in
Halley did that of Newton in the case of the Principia; and
nothing but circumstances which made it more convenient to
print it at Nuremberg than at Wittemberg, prevented the
name           of Rheticus from appearing in the title-page                                   as editor.
      *** Mr.
           De Morgan requests us to append the following
remark to our reprint of his paper.
      THE mode of defining the sine, cosine, &c., which is now
becoming common, and which, as appears above, was pre
ferred by Rheticus, was first advocated in modern times by
Dr. Peacock. In the second volume of his Algebra, just pub
lished (page 157, note), Dr. Peacock remarks “ the definition
in the text, which is now exclusively used (see Hymer’s Trigo
nometry, Cambridge, 1837), was first formally introduced into
my Algebra (Cambridge, 1830), and afterwards into a Syllabus
of a course of Lectures on Trigonometry (Cambridge, 1833).”
   The fact, however, as to printed publication,   that the                                  is,
system      question first appeared
                in                      Lardner's Trigonometry, in
though    Dr. Peacock      not the less the reviver
                                         is                     the                     of   it.     In
first edition               of
                  Dr. Lardner's work (1826), the definition                                               by
ratios    given, but not used, the old ones being also given.

Thus the formulae for the sines and cosines           sums, &c.                    of                     of
angles are deduced from the old definitions.        Thus       said:                            it   is
    (p.
    42), that “from the definition                        angle                    of

Zurairoo valley to the east of Gooty, where it is connected
with the Cuddapah chains, which, curving easterly, terminate
near the coast in the Naggery ranges.
   These ranges consist principally of the diamond-sandstone
and limestone, and comprise within their area the diamond
mines of Condapetta, Chinnoor, Ovalumpully, Munimudgoo,
Banganpilly, Ramulacota, and others of less note. The fossil
deposit rests on this sandstone conglomerate, which at no
great distance is seen reposing on granite, with a dip of 10°
to the south of east.
   A little to the east of this, the diamond limestone intervenes
between the granite and sandstone, underlying the latter in

cesses by which fissures in rocks are lined and filled up with
minerals which we look in vain for in the enclosing walls;
geodes of calcedony and agate, with calc spar and crystals of
quartz and zeolite in the midst of calc spar.               I have seen a
solitary and beautiful pyramidal hexagon of rock crystal, glit
tering like a diamond in the whitest snow, in a mass of the
saccharine marble of Carrara.
    None of the shells have lost their carbonic acid, although
they have parted with most of their colour; and some are
quite empty as if imbedded but yesterday; most have been-
evidently entombed in a dead state.
    As no trap or other volcanic rock was at hand to account
for the silicification of this freshwater limestone, proceeded   I
to examine the present deposit of the spring a few yards west
of the fossil bed. Its water I discovered to be slightly ther
mal, having a temperature of 85° 3' Fahr., which is a few de
grees above the mean temperature of the spot, isothermally
calculated; the height above the sea, as roughly approximated
by the boiling-point of water, is about 1250 feet, and the ave
rage temperature of the ordinary wells about 80° Fahr.
   The present deposit of these waters is a brownish-gray cal
careous mud, about six inches thick, mingled with sand, im
bedding similar freshwater shells and a minute specimen of
Paludina. Stems of grasses and leaves were also found in                    it;
some   of the latter apparently just decayed, while others are
blackened       by
                 carbonization; none were fossilized.

  The heat of the springs might be annually or triennially
noted with compared thermometers. After many experiments,
I  find existing meteorological causes generally affect the tem
perature of such springs in a sensible degree; and great care
should be taken, in making successive experiments, that the
meteorological conditions be as far as possible similar.          The
 time of the year should be the dry season, and the time of
day sun-set and sun-rise.
    The plains and valleys of India are often covered with
sheets of kunker, sometimes upwards of seventy feet deep,
overspreading places where it could never have been depo
 sited by rivers or rivulets, and where now not a spring or
drop of water is to be seen.       Along the edges of trap dykes,
we    occasionally  observe mounds of kunker precisely resem
bling those around the mouths of existing kunker-depositing
springs, but we look in vain for the springs that deposited the
former.
    Still these dwindled remains of springs are generally to be
found where kunker prevails at no great depth from the sur
face, deprived of their heat and of the greater part of their
mineral character, which renders the water better adapted for
the use of man and animals.         Most of the native diggers in
boring for a well, consider kunker as almost a sure sign of
the vicinity of water. If there can be any doubt after what
has been said of the certainty of the vast sheets of kunker at

facts.    The calcareous conglomerates at present forming
along the shores of the Red Sea and Mediterranean, are
little different from the present kunkrous conglomerates of
India.
    It may  also be added, that the surface soils of Southern India,
whether of the red alluvial or the black regur, are frequently
so strongly impregnated with muriate and carbonate of soda,
as to be utterly unfit for the purposes of agriculture.         Many
of the  springs   in such situations are still    brackish, holding  a
portion of these salts in solution, but are quite inadequate to
have caused their diffusion in the superincumbent soil to the
present immense amount.
   It is difficult to classify a formation still going on, and to
fix the period, geologically, when it commenced, as it is seen
in   all
       rocks from the granite         alluvium.    We have sufficient
                                                  to

cular current is proportional to the rank of the animal in the
series of beings, whilst the duration of this current after death
varies in an opposite relation.
     I
     wished to study the influence of the different gases on the
intensity and the duration of the muscular current; for this
purpose I arranged an apparatus which allowed me to have a
muscular pile in a certain gaseous medium, and to open and
close at will the circuit of this pile with the galvanometer.
I  operated in atmospheric air, in oxygen, in highly rarefied
air, in carbonic acid, and in hydrogen.           In these different
media the muscular pile performed equally, both as to inten
sity and duration.     Hydrogen gas alone presented a singu
larity which could not have been foreseen previous to the ex
periment.     This peculiarity does not depend on any action
of the gas on the muscles, but on a phaenomenon of secon
dary polarity which manifests itself, whatever be the source
of the current. The fact        that     operating  is,this gas with
                                                                in                        in
a   muscular pile, the deviation remains constant for several
hours.    This nullity     action        of                of
                                       the different gases above
named         on
            the intensity and the duration        the muscular cur            is of
rent, proves that the origin      this current        of
                                                      the muscle              in                          it

rightly understood the latest anatomical labours on the struc
ture of muscles, on their relations with the tendons and the
sarcolema, I cannot hesitate to regard the proper current, or
that from the tendon to the surface of the muscle, as the most
simple case of the muscular current. The tendinous fibres
are in connexion with the muscular fibres, whilst the sarco
lema envelopes the muscular fibres only.    This result   ren           ...                       is

suppose the protoxide of iron to be combined with silica in
the form of silicate of iron, and this silicate scattered through
the crystal, it is obvious that the mineral, if pure, would be
an anhydrous silicate of alumina, having an atomic weight of
4-25.
  I   have compared the specimens of bucholzite from America
with sillimanite, and find them to agree, excepting that the
bucholzite is not so pure as the sillimanite.    The shape of the
crystals, the hardness and lustre, and the specific gravity agree
very nearly.
  I   have never seen the fibrolite of Bournon and Chenevix,
but the descriptions and analysis correspond with those of
sillimanite.
    Henceforward the terms sillimanite, bucholzite and fibrolite
may be dropt, and the species distinguished by the name of
silicate of alumina, which indicates the chemical constitution
of the mineral.

  The author adduces some       new experiments in confirmation of his
theory of the nature and causes of the motion of glaciers, and which
present an analogy with the phenomena exhibited by the flow of
masses of semifluid or viscous matter contained in a narrow channel,
along which they move by the force of gravity; and also with the
ripple marks on the surface of a stream of water when             its

                        TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM,
 A COMMUNICATION                 on Terrestrial Magnetism,   by Professor
         Locke, the result of several years' observation in various parts
 of the United States, was read at the American Philosophical So
 ciety, April 5, 1844, and referred to a Committee, consisting of
 Prof. Frazer, Mr. M'Euen and Prof. Bache.
    Prof. Locke gave a brief history of the circumstances which in
duced him to undertake these researches, in which he made a grate
 ful acknowledgement for the kind and able instruction, especially in
 the practical manipulations, received from Prof. Bache of this Society,
 while in London and Paris. He read a part of the correspondence
 between himself and Col. Sabine on the subject of the point of maxi
 muin intensity at or near to Lake Superior, and suggested, as the
 probable result of his researches and of those of Lieut. Lefroy,
 briefly alluded to by Col. Sabine, that the region of maximum inten
 sity is either at Kewenon peninsula, south side of Lake Superior, or
 along a line extending thence to Rainy Lake—the last opinion having
 been expressed by Col. Sabine in his correspondence. To determine
 this point more precisely, Prof. Locke suggested that observations
 should be multiplied in various parts of the region of the lake. The
 observations were prefaced by a popular explanation of what is meant
  by the four elements of terrestrial magnetism, declination (“varia
  tion”) dip or inclination, horizontal intensity of magnetic force, and
  total intensity of the same force. These explanations were followed
  by the observations of six successive years, commencing in 1838,
  and extending more or less over the region included between the
  middle of Kentucky on the south, and the north side of Lake Supe
  rior on the north; and between Cambridge, Mass., on the east, to the
  middle of Iowa on the west.       His observations had been accompa
  nied throughout by remarks on the geology at each station, and he
  expressed the opinion that those observations justified the conclusion,
  that the general character of the rocks, especially as regards the di
  stinction between the aqueous and the igneous formations, could be
  ascertained by the elements, as indicated by lines of observations ex
  tended along any given region.      He exhibited a chart illustrative of
  this subject, on which the two quantities of dip and intensity were
  represented by curves passing through ordinates standing on hori
  zontal distances, generally along lines of latitude.     These curves,
  along regions of aqueous rocks, such as those along the Mississippi,
  were remarkably uniform, while those over igneous rocks were ex

540            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
tremely irregular and undulating, sometimes ascending and descend
ing with a needle-like sharpness.     He remarked, that if these di
stinctive characters obtain so generally as to constitute a law, the
magnetical instruments will form a kind of “mineral or divining rod.”
to the geologist.
   There was exhibited, also, a chart of the United States, showing
chiefly, the isodynamic lines consistent with the observations. These
lines form ovals around Lake Superior as an axis, the longer or
pointed ends pointing towards New York, and in the opposite direc
tion. The outer oval descending along the Hudson river, passing
through the city of New York, along the coast, to near Baltimore,
and, turning westward, traverses Maryland, Virginia, and Kentucky,
and crosses the Mississippi into Missouri about thirty miles below
St. Louis.
   The force along this line is 994, that at Cincinnati, in Ohio, being
 1000; and an oval is delineated at every increase of 10, until, at the
axis at Lake Superior, it rises to from 1054 to 1060.         But Prof.
Locke stated, more observations are needed to fix more precisely those
lines at remote points, and he expressed a desire that the observa
tions of Major Graham, Prof. Bache, and Prof. Loomis, together with
his own, might be united in a suitable chart, such as might be pro
duced by a convention of observers.      Two other charts, explained
in the communication, were also exhibited; the one a copy of a part
of Col. Sabine's north polar chart, with additions, and with a delinea
tion of the relative positions of the astronomical poles, the pole of
dip and convergence discovered by Ross, and the pole of intensity at
Lake Superior; and the other a particular delineation of Copper
Harbour and of Porter's Island, where, in Prof. Locke’s line of ob
servations, he found the greatest intensity of force.
   Prof. Locke, in a second paper, continues his observations upon
the magnetic dip and intensity, made at different points in the
United States during the year 1844, and includes thirty-five sets of
observations made at twenty-four different stations. He then gives a
series of thirteen observations made at three stations, viz. Fort Lee,
N. Y., Snake Hill, and Patterson, N. J., intended to show the re
markable changes which take place both in the dip and intensity, in
passing from rocks of the usual kind, to those belonging to the trap
pean family; which changes, so far as they regard the magnetic in
tensity, he announces in the following terms –“The intensity, which
ordinarily has a value along a line of moderate length not varying
beyond certain moderate limits, becomes at the base of a trappean
pinnacle, extraordinarily diminished, and at the top of the same still
more extraordinarily increased.”     These changes, as well as those
of the dip which follow the same law, are illustrated by diagrams, in
which the values of the dip and intensity are represented as the ordi
nates of a curve, the distances between the stations being taken upon
the line of abscissas.   Prof. Locke believes these changes to be due
to the assumption of magnetic properties by the trappean rocks, the
axis of the magnet coinciding with the axis of figure of the hill, which
is generally vertical.

   Prof. Locke strongly urges the propriety of multiplying observa
tions upon these phaenomena, in order to develope the general law;
and concludes by returning his thanks to Col. Sabine and the British
Association for the kindness and liberality with which they have ten
dered their assistance in his labours.—Proceedings of the Amer. Phil.

                                            COHESION OF LIQUIDs.
   Prof. Henry made a verbal communication to the American Philoso
phical Society, on April 5th, 1844, relative to the cohesion of liquids;
in which he stated that very erroneous ideas are given as to the con
stitution of matter in the ordinary books on Natural Philosophy. The
passage of a body from a solid to a liquid state is generally attributed to
the neutralization of the attraction of cohesion by the repulsion of the
increased quantity of heat; the liquid being supposed to retain a small
portion of        its
                original attraction, which         shown       the force necesis              by

 May,)   states that he had prosecuted his experiments on the soap
 bubble to a greater extent, and had arrived at a number of results
which appeared to him of some interest in reference to capillarity,
 a subject which had given rise to a greater diversity of opinion than
 any other part of natural philosophy. As an evidence of its present
unsettled state, he mentioned the fact that the last edition of the En
 cyclopædia Britannica contained two articles on this subject, under
 different names; one by Dr. Young, and the other by Mr. Ivory,
 which explain the phaenomena on entirely different physical prin
ciples.
    According to the theory of Young and Poisson, many of the phae
nomena of liquid cohesion, and all those of capillarity, are due to a
contractile force existing at the free surface of the liquid, and which
tends in all cases to urge the liquid in the direction of the radius of
curvature towards the centre, with a force inversely as this radius.
According to this theory, the spherical form of a dew-drop is not the
 effect of the attraction of each molecule of the water on every other,
as in the action of gravitation in producing the globular form of the
planets (since the attraction of cohesion only extends to an unappre
ciable distance), but it is due to the contractile force which tends
constantly to enclose the given quantity of water within the smallest
surface, namely, that of a sphere.      Prof. Henry finds a contractile
force  perfectly  similar to that assumed by this theory in the surface
of the  soap-bubble;    indeed, the bubble may be considered a drop of
water with the internal liquid removed, and its place supplied by air.
The spherical force in the two cases is produced by the operation of
the same cause.      The contractile force in the surface of the bubble
is easily shown by blowing a large bubble on the end of a wide tube,
say an inch in diameter; as soon as the mouth is removed, the bubble
will be seen to diminish rapidly, and at the same time quite a forcible
current of air will be blown through the tube against the face. This
effect is not due to the ascent of the heated air from the lungs with
which the bubble was inflated, for the same effect is produced by in
flating with cold air, and also when the bubble is held perpendicu
larly above the face, so that the current is downwards.
    Many experiments were made to determine the amount of this
force, by blowing a bubble on the larger end of a glass tube in the
form of the letter U, and partially filled with water; the contractile
force of the bubble, transmitted through the enclosed air, forced
down the water in the larger leg of the tube, and caused it to rise
in the smaller. The difference of level observed by means of a mi
croscope, gave the force in grains per square inch, derived from the
known pressure of a given height of water. The thickness of the
film of soap water which formed the envelope of the bubble, was es
timated as before by the colour exhibited just before bursting. The
results of these experiments agree with those of weighing the bubble,
in giving a great intensity to the molecular attraction of the liquid;
equal at least to several hundred pounds to the square inch. Several
other methods were employed to measure the tenacity of the film, the

                          Meteorological Observations.                                543
general results of which were the same: the numerical details of
these are reserved, however, until the experiments can be repeated
with a more delicate balance.
   The comparative cohesion of pure water and soap water was de
termined by the weight necessary to detach the same plate from each;
and in all cases the pure water required the greater force. The want
of permanency in the bubble of pure water is therefore not due to
feeble attraction, but to the perfect mobility of the molecules, which
causes the equilibrium, as in the case of the arch without friction of
parts, to be destroyed by the slightest extraneous force.
   Several other experiments with films of soap water were also de
scribed, which afford striking illustrations of the principles of capil
larity, and which apparently have an important bearing on the whole
subject of cohesion.—Proceedings of the Amer. Phil. Soc., vol. iv

*R also being expressive of a rational function.
  The equation for W will therefore belong to a class of
equations of the sixth degree, the resolution of which can, as
Abelt  has shown, be effected                          by means             of equations of            the
second and third degrees.

bination of radicals and rational functions the general equa

the following experiments.
   Equal portions of the waters obtained from the oils of dill,
carraway, pimento, spearmint and cinnamon were taken, and
to one-half the proportion of spirit ordered by the London
 College was added, the other half remaining in                      itsoriginal
state; these were           all
                              loosely corked, marked, and placed
aside. After remaining six months they were examined, when
the spearmint and carraway waters, with the spirit, were found
to   be distinctly acid, reddening litmus paper and causing                        an
effervescence with carbonated alkalies; all the others remained
perfectly sound. They were again examined after                         lapse
                                                                         a         of

 while the same waters without the              spirit,  remained      perfectly
 unchanged, and evidenced no signs                 of
                                                    acidity.     On examina

 undergone any further alteration.                                      -
 I    need scarcely mention, that                 selecting the specimens
                                                  in
specified, the object was          totry the general action          ofordinary
exposure     tothe atmosphere           on
                                         waters varying        intheir charac
ters and sources,       asother samples might have been chosen
which would doubtless have become acid                        as
                                                               soon,         or

sooner than the carraway and spearmint,                  asfor instance, rose
water, elder-flower, orange-flower, peppermint, and penny
royal waters.
   Another point       infavour         of

that these waters are liable            become mucilaginous and sour
                                        to

to prevent this; from the foregoing experiments, however,                          it
will   be  evidently seen         produce
                                  to              directly contrary effect,

and the formulae        ofthe Edinburgh and Dublin Pharmaco
poeias will      equally
                 be           inerror        on
                                            this point.
  It   iscurious that       ofthe   European       Pharmacopoeias, that           I
have looked into       during     this  investigation,      not one labours
under this error, their instructions being simply                   todistil the
materials with water.
   On searching back through former editions                   of the London
Pharmacopoeia,        toascertain,       possible, whether the formulae
                                        if

alteration had been        effected,    I  found that         inthe Pharma

the present day; after this date the error of adding small por
tions of spirit seems to have originated, and to have been
regularly copied, with very little deviation, from edition to
edition, down to the year 1836, the general directions being to
distil a certain quantity of the water from a given weight of
material, and then to add five ounces of proof spirit to each
gallon, that it may be preserved, or rather             may say in many         I
cases, to spoil      it.        In
                          the edition         1836, the proportion
                                                                of                                             of

 more especially the case where oils of considerable age had
 been employed.        By this mode of operating, the results ob
 tained range from 0:50 gr., in the iO00 gr. measures of the
 water, as in peppermint-water, to 1:20 gr. in dill and pimento
 waters; many others were tried, which ranged between these
two points.       It may perhaps be as well here to mention, that
 it was observed very soon after the application of the heat in
evaporating, that flocculi of carbonate of magnesia invariably
separated.
    The general opinion has been that these waters were formed
in consequence of the magnesia as a base favouring the union
of the   oil  and water, and thus implying some combination                                                  of

this was not        any

      OME   short time since some green glass wine bottles were
       put into my hands for examination, the inner surface                                                  of

 found not to be the case, the surface of the glass having been
evidently affected by the action of some corroding agent.
 Portions of the glass were therefore submitted to the action
of a weak solution of tartaric acid, as the acid most likely to
 be present in wines; and in the course of twenty-four hours,
the vessel, in which the digestion was conducted, was one
fourth part full of beautiful crystals of bitartrate of lime. It
was also strongly acted upon by diluted hydrochloric acid,
forming a solution of chloride of calcium, and a gelatinous
mass from the hydration of the silicic acid.     From these pre
liminary experiments it was evident that a great excess of
lime had been employed in the manufacture of the glass,
and this had rendered it totally unfit for any of the ordinary
purposes to which such bottles are applied.       The glass was
then submitted to analysis, and as the routine followed, in
this and the subsequent case, was similar to that adopted
in the examination of                    all

to ascertain to what extent the foregoing glass differed from
our ordinary green glass of commerce, as occurring in the

the following are the results, calculated as before to the 100

   On comparing these results with the former, it will be seen
that the total amount of bases present is far less, and calcula
ting them out as silicates, the first analysis will show a defi
ciency of silicic acid amounting to about 20 parts on the 100.
   It was about the period of this examination being termi
nated, that Professor Faraday, in a lecture at the Royal Insti
tution on the manufacture of glass mirrors, exhibited a French
glass bottle   which had been subjected accidentally by Mr.
Pepys, jun. to the action of diluted sulphuric acid, in the pro
portions of 1 of acid to 10 of water; in a short time this had,

LXXXIII.        On certain Processes in which Aniline is formed.
      By Drs.   J. S. MUspkATT and A. W. HoFMANN*.
     OTWITHSTANDING                         the laborious endeavours that
        have been made of late years to enable us to foretell the
metamorphoses which a given organic compound should sus
tain under the influence of different chemical agents, still it
must be admitted that we have by no means succeeded in esta
blishing antecedently, with absolute certainty, the modus ope
randi of a decomposition; we have only arrived at some main
features, giving us an insight as to the probable result of an
experiment we are about to perform.
   It is known, for example, that by the action of chlorine or
bromine a number of equivalents of hydrogen is replaced;
that phosphoric acid eliminates the elements of water; and
that by treating a compound with caustic barytes, carbon and
oxygen are abstracted in the form of carbonic acid. There
are many instances, however, where no change occurs, or if
so, it is at least quite dissimilar.
   The fundamental cause of this uncertainty lies in the defi
ciency of our present knowledge respecting the true constitu
tion of organic bodies.
   Hitherto the simplest decompositions known are those ef
fected by powerful agents and with the cooperation of very
high temperatures.       In such cases the chemical constitution
of the substance decomposed influences the nature of the pro
ducts far less than the composition and affinities of- the ele
ments of the decomposing body.
   In regard to this some observations deserving of attention
have been recently made which particularly gave origin to the
researches described in the present treatise.
   It has been ascertained, namely, that bodies possessing the
same composition but very different constitutions,      when sub
mitted to the influence of     strong agents, suffer frequently the
same decomposition.
  One of the most remarkable examples                of this kind was lately
remarked by Cahours.

of Prof. Forbes, who has been the first to demonstrate by
well-devised measures and experiments the actual motion of
the glacier, but who has not, that I can perceive, thrown any
fresh light upon the causes of these motions, by the assertion
of an ill-defined plasticity in the mass of ice, and                     illustra                       its

                           Note on the preceding Paper.
   Since the above paper was written and read, it has been
urged as a forcible argument against the views I therein put
forward, as to the impossibility of plasticity existing in a cry
stallized mass, that the mass of glacier ice may be viewed
as a sort of crystalline sponge, penetrated by water held be
tween      its
            interstices               in
                                   directions andall         depths, and           at   all

plastic, such       compound structure may admit

be in this brittle, loose and dissolving condition, and hence
must crumble away under pressure from above with great ra
pidity, while the crystalline particles thus pulverized (so to
speak) must be washed away and melted in the subglacial
water, and thus a source of very rapid descent added to all
others.

                        Hopkins, Esq., M.A., F.R.S.,                                    &c.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magasine and Journal.
       GENTLEMEN,
I     MUST request                   of you permission to offer
                                                 a few remarks
     on Prof. Forbes's reply to my letters on glaciers.
   The Professor says that I have misrepresented his theory.
The first proof he offers of it    that have dismissed  is,
                                                         some      I                               it
what too  summarily      my               in
                              second memoir     glacial motion.                     on
This may imply                 an
                     inadequate appreciation     the theory,                            of
the estimation               of     its
                       author, but ought not assuredly                                                      to   be in
considered      misrepresentation
                     as   a                                        of   it.
    Again, the Professor cites,        another instance as      misrepre                      of
 sentation, my observations respecting the inadequacy                   his                                 of
 theory, even       his mechanical reasoning were admitted,

   part  of  the  problem,      Prof. Forbes arrived            the conclusion                  at
   that the direction                    of

troversy ever provoked.           More especially is it unreasonable
when considered with immediate reference to the two primary
conclusions above-mentioned of the Professor's mechanical
reasoning; for after having satisfied himself of his having made
one oversight, the single paragraph following fig. 2 of my
Third Letter, could not fail to convince him that he had also
made a second.          Having admitted the one, he must necessa
rily admit the other.
     The Professor, in the commencement of his reply, makes a
formal disclaimer against             deductions from hypotheses re

integrant parts. But                   on

 Does Prof. Forbes intend to intimate that his own me

 vague conclusions against the demonstrative results of the
  mathematician, we pass them in silence; but when the appli
 cability of such results is denied by men of totally different
 character, men of high scientific position and acquirement,
  we expect from them not vague and general assertion, but
 explicit reasons for their objections. This is what Professor
  Forbes has not even attempted to do with reference to my

 servations on the relative motions of the upper and lower
surfaces of a glacier.      The claims of the two theories would
thus be decided beyond dispute. Accurate observations are
also required to ascertain the form which a continuous straight
line drawn on the surface of a glacier and perpendicular to
 its axis, will assume                 by
                             the more rapid motion          central                     of     its
portion.     Will            it    be
                           deformed into      continuous loop, like a
fig.   1,   or
            into   discontinuous one, like fig. 2.2 Such observa

LXXXVI.       On the rule for obtaining the Atomic Volume of
  Elementary Substances.    By BENJAMIN BoughEY, Esq.
 To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
I
     GENTLEMEN,
      FIND      it stated in several works on the subject, that by
       dividing the atomic weight of any element by                     specific                        its
gravity, the result will                           be
                                     the relative volume               ultimate                of    its
atom or its atomic volume.               But let us examine whether this
rule   in       its
                 present state          constructed is      sound principles.        on
If   we take for example the case              oxygen gas,       specific gra
                                                                   of                          its
vity  is  (water 1'000) about 00134; now                 we divide this          if                                  by
                                                                                                                      8
 (its atomic weight), the result will               5970. Again, take the  be
same     oxygen        theattemperature          32°,  and also        of
                                                                     212°, and                       at
      its  specific gravity          these temperatures
                                                                                                at be
let                                                at               treated                                           as
before, and we obtain for the atomic volume                        32°, 5500,
and   at  212°, 7700.         From these results           would appear that     it
an    atom       oxygen
                of         fills    space      a32°  equal     5500;
                                                                   at       60°,          to                    at
5970; and           212°, 7700.         But the most       generally-received
opinion         of    an at
                      atom        that       is,
                                               incapable     it expansion
                                                                  is                       of                         or
contraction, and that when heated the atoms themselves do
not undergo expansion, but are only further separated from
each other.          But how must we reconcile the results just
given with this opinion?                 thus appears that the rule just
                                                    It
stated     isfallacious               in     its
                                   present state, but           quite evident         it   is
that the fault lies, not with the rule itself, but with the spe
cific gravity.
     The question then arises, how are we                  avoid these objec
                                                                                 be to                     by

                               be                          avoided       taking

                deduced from this result? But                  we liquefy the   as if

   And will a series of specific gravities thus obtained serve
only to construct tables of relative atomic volumes? Will it
not then be reasonable to look for analogies between the spe
cific gravity, the conduction of heat, specific heat, conduction
and development of electricity, &c.*, hitherto looked for in
vain, on which to base new laws, and to explain phaenomena
hitherto inexplicable?

   the American Philosophical Society, on a recent speculation by
   Faraday on Electric Conduction and the Nature of Matterf.
     MEssrs. EDITORS,              Philadelphia, Nov. 30, 1844.
      T the last meeting of the American Philosophical Society,
        I made some verbal remarks on a recent “speculation”
of the celebrated Faraday, published in the London and Edin
burgh Philosophical Magazine for February last (vol. xxiv.
p. 136.). Of course a brief notice will be given of those re
marks in the bulletin of the Proceedings.      I send you for
publication a statement of my reasoning on the questions at
issue, hoping that it will not be found unworthy of the atten
tion of philosophical chemists.
                       Your friend,         RoBERT HARE.
   Faraday objects to the Newtonian idea of an atom being
associated with combining ratios.    These he conceives to
have been more advantageously designated as chemical equi
valents f.
   This sagacious investigator adverts to the fact, that after
each atom in a mass of the metal potassium has combined
with an atom of oxygen and an atom of water, forming thus a
hydrated oxide, the resulting aggregate occupies much less
space than        its
                metallic ingredient previously occupied;                                   so
                                                                     on be
 * I    would here also merely ask the question, would    it not         more on
philosophical principles if these tables were likewise obtained      the same
                 have proposed for the specific gravity?

that taking equal bulks of the hydrate and of potassium,
 there will be in the metal only 430 metallic atoms, while
in the hydrate there will be 700 such atoms.                      Yet in the
latter, besides the 700 atoms, there will be an equal num
ber of aqueous and oxygenous atoms, in                     2800 ponderable          all

to which those properties appertain.             Yet I cannot concur in
the idea, that because it is only with “m ” that we are ac
quainted, the existence of “a” must not be inferred; so that
bodies are to be considered as constituted of their materialized
powers.       I use the word materialized, because it is fully ad
mitted by Faraday, that by dispensing with an impenetrable
atom “a,” we do not get rid of the idea of matter, but have
to imagine each atom as existing throughout the whole sphere
of    itsforce, instead                 of
                               being condensed about the centre.

seem    to involve necessarily the conclusion that matter fills all

phaenomena    of electricity would be inexplicable.   This disin
clination to the admission of an   imponderable   electrical cause
has been the more remarkable, as his researches have not
only proved the existence of prodigious electrical power in
metals, but likewise that it is evolved during chemico-electric
reaction, in equivalent proportion to the quantity of ponder
able matter decomposed or combined.
   According to his researches, a grain of water by electrolytic
reaction with four grains of zinc, evolves as much electricity
as would charge fifteen millions of square feet of coated glass.
But in addition to the proofs of the existence of electrical
powers in metals thus furnished, it is demonstrated that this
power must be inseparably associated with metals, by the well
known fact, that in the magneto-electric machine, an appara
tus which we owe to his genius and the mechanical ingenuity
of Pixii and Saxton, a coil of wire being subjected to the in
ductive influence of a magnet, is capable of furnishing, within

   Thus while assuming the existence of fewer imponderable

Dec. 11,        N the Motion of Glaciers. By William Hopkins, M.A.,
   1843.           F.R.S., Fellow of the Society (Second Memoir).
    In  a previous memoir Mr. Hopkins had given the details of cer
tain experiments, by which it was proved that ice will descend with
a very slow unaccelerated motion down an inclined plane, presenting
a surface like that of a common slab of paving-stone, at an angle
scarcely exceeding half a degree (and probably also at still smaller
angles), provided the lower surface of the ice in immediate contact
with the inclined plane be in a state of constant but slow disintegra
tion. This experimental conclusion was brought forward in support
 of the sliding theory of De Saussure, and the author endeavoured to
 explain, according to that theory, different phaenomena connected
 with the motion of glaciers. He there considered glacial ice as a
 solid substance, having a certain degree of plasticity and flewibility,
 and the general mass of the glacier as a dislocated mass, the greater
 motion of the central portion of the glacier being much facilitated by
 these dislocations, though due partly, but in a comparatively small
 degree, to the plasticity of the general mass. In the present memoir
 Mr. Hopkins considers what would be the nature of the motion under
 other hypotheses respecting the constitution of glaciers.        (1.) The
 lower part of a glacier may be conceived to be crushed, and conse
 quently disintegrated, by the superincumbent weight, each compo
 ment particle still retaining its solidity; or (2.) the whole mass may
 be conceived to be plastic, and to move by a change of form, pro
 duced by gravity, in each component element. The author contends,
 if either of these hypotheses were true, that, catteris paribus, the more
 superficial portion of the mass must tend to move the faster as the
  depth of the glacier should be greater; and that, consequently, the
  part of the glacier near the upper extremity must generally tend to
  move much faster than that near the lower extremity, assuming
  always the whole, or much the greater part of glacial motion, to be
  due to the plasticity of the mass, and to be independent of sliding
  over its bed.   But in such case it is manifest that the general state
  of a  glacier must be one of longitudinal compression, more particu
  larly during the summer months, when the motion is greatest. Now
  the author contends that the general existenee of transverse fissures
  (at least during summer) is a conclusive proof against the existence

608                       Cambridge Philosophical Society.
of general longitudinal compression; and he         observes that no ob
server ventured to assert the fact of such compression to be dedu
cible from actual observation. He conceives this to be a serious ob
jection to the hypothesis here considered.
   In this memoir Mr. Hopkins has also investigated the directions
in which transverse fissures must be formed when referrible to the
internal tensions superinduced by the conditions to which glaciers in
general are subjected, and more especially by the more rapid motion
of their central portions.
   Assuming the velocity of each particle of the glacier to be the
same in any vertical line (which is at least true at points not remote
from the surface), the glacier may, in this investigation, be consi
dered as a lamina.    In this lamina take a rectangular element having
two of      its
           sides parallel    the axis to  the glacier, and, therefore, the

   February 5, 1844.—On the Fundamental Antithesis of Philosophy.
By W. Whewell, D.D.                                                   -
   The fundamental antithesis here   spoken of, is that which is vari
ously expressed by the opposition of thoughts and things, theory and
fact, ideas and senses, necessary and experimental truth; also by
 the opposition of reflection and sensation, subject and object.      It is
 remarked that we can have no knowledge without the union, no phi
 losophy without the separation of these two elements. This funda
 mental antithesis of philosophy is an antithesis of inseparable ele
 ments.    It is also shown that the terms which denote the two ele
ments of this antithesis cannot in any case be applied absolutely and
exclusively.     We cannot say, this is a fact and not a theory, or this
is a  theory  and not a fact; for a true theory is a fact; a fact is a fa
miliar theory. It was further observed, that the antithesis being
inseparable, one element seems, and is asserted, in different systems
of philosophy, to be derived from the other; ideas from experience,
or experience from ideas. But we must always have both elements:
thus in mechanics, and in our experience, we have necessary princi
ples, such as that every event must have a cause; and in chemistry.
also other necessary principles, as that the chemical composition of
a body determines its kind and properties.
    March 4.—On the Method of Least Squares. By R. L. Ellis,
Esq.
   The aim of this paper is to give a succinct exposition of the differ
ent demonstrations by which it has been proposed to establish the
validity of the rule known as the method of least squares.    The first
demonstration of this celebrated rule (which had been previously
proposed by Legendre) is that given by Gauss in the Theoria Motás.
The next appears to be that of Laplace, which has been followed,
without variation of principle, by Poisson and other French writers.
The demonstration of Gauss is based upon the assumption, that the
arithmetical mean is the most probable result to be derived from a
series of direct observations of an unknown magnitude.         This as
sumption is alleged by Laplace to be altogether precarious; and it
appears that Gauss acquiesced in this remark, as he subsequently,
in the Theoria Combinationis Observationum, produced another de
monstration, which is independent of this assumption.           As the first
method of Gauss has been followed by later writers, of whom Encke
is one, it seemed desirable to endeavour to ascertain if the objection
of Laplace be well-founded; and this the writer has attempted to
do in the first part of the present communication.           His conclusion
an is,
    that although the practice    of    adopting the arithmetical mean    as
    approximation     to the true value  of   the unknown magnitude ob
served,  is founded   on  just principles,  yet  that we are not entitledto
say that it   leads  tothe most probable result; and consequently that
the demonstration     in  question     invalid.
   The writer then      proceeds to is  consider Laplace's demonstration.
This involves   no  precarious    assumption,   but the mathematical part

of the investigation is of very considerable difficulty, and cannot                                             be
said to be altogether free from doubt. For Laplace's analysis, an
other, founded on a theorem which was first made use of by Fourier
in his researches on heat, is substituted; and by this change the
mathematical difficulties of the subject are very much diminished.
An attempt is also made to test the accuracy of Laplace's methods
by reference to a particular case,
   The third part of the paper relates to Gauss's second method.
The relation in which it stands to that of Laplace is distinctly
pointed out; the difference between them arising merely from this,
that whereas Laplace considered the importance of a positive or ne
                             is,
gative error (that           of  error an   excess     in defect)          propor

tional  toits arithmetical magnitude, Gauss assumes the square                  the                        of
magnitude         of
                 the error             as
                                  the measure                              its
                                                           importance, alleging
                                                                      of
that this importance not being          magnitude, does not strictly admit
                                                  a
of numerical evaluation; that some assumption                therefore requisite,is
and that that which           he
                            proposes     not more arbitrary than Laplace's,
                                                   is

more satisfactory calculations,
   The writer then shows that neither Laplace's investigations, nor
that  of Gauss         in
                     the Theoria Combinationis Observationum, tends                                             to
prove, that the results            of

probable     of   all
                   possible results.     This point, with regard             which                    to
there has occasionally been some degree                 confusion, seems

    Divergent series are either of infinite divergence, such as 1+2+3
+4+&c., in which summation of             terms may give any sum, however
great; or of finite divergence, such as cos 0-F cos 20+ ..., in which
no number of terms can give more than a certain quantity.                   The
former are rejected by most modern continental writers, the latter
are retained.
    Section 1.-All divergent series, whether their divergence be finite
or infinite, stand upon the same basis, and ought to be accepted or
rejected together, as far as any grounds of confidence are concerned
which are not directly derived from experience. The author exa
mines the reasons which Poisson gives for maintaining the contra
dictory of the preceding. That great analyst considers 1 — 1 + 1
-1   +... for instance, as l—g-H g” –g3 +..., where g is less than
unity by an infinitely small quantity.          Mr. De Morgan maintains,
that this  method,     if allowed in transformation of a finite diverging
series into a   convergent     one, of which the convergency only begins
after an infinite number of terms, must also be allowed, unless rea

infinitely divergent series, have been those in which integration has
been applied, and those only.
     In this section warning is also given against the supposition that
0+0+0+ ... must represent 0 in all cases.
     Section 3.—It generally happens that the real analytical equiva
lent of the different values of an indeterminate expression, is the mean
 of these different values. This principle is the one which was adopted
 by Leibnitz in his well-known explanation of the meaning of        1-l
  + 1 — 1 + ... Without assuming that anything like proof can be
 given, the author notes, as instances in which the thing asserted is
 true, algebraical series, trigonometrical series, Fourier's integral,
 Poisson's expression of a function between any limits by an infinite
 series of trigonometrical integrals, and also the sine and cosine of
                           b
 infinity.
             Assuming/(t     q, a dr: (b-a)  to represent the mean value
 of p a between a and b, the author tries what ought to be the value
 of tan co, if this principle be true, and finds + M-1, which on trial
 is found to satisfy the fundamental equations of trigonometry.
      Section 4.—Series of alternately positive and negative signs stand
 upon a much safer basis than those in which all the terms have the
 same signs, and that whether their divergence be finite or infinite.
     It has long been observed, that when the terms of an alternating
 series begin by diminishing, even though they afterwards increase,
 the converging portion may be made effective in approximating to
 the arithmetical equivalent of the series. The error committed by
 stopping at any term is not so great as the first of the rejected terms.
 In many alternating series this has been proved to be true, and it
 seems never to have been supposed that the theorem was anything
 but universal.     In this section instances are produced in which the
 theorem is not    true;  and at the same time various proofs of it are
 given, each of which applies to very extensive cases, and the tendency
 of which is to show that it is only under definite and unusual condi
 tions that the theorem can fail. Still, however, no positive criterion
 is established for ascertaining whether the theorem be true or not in
 any particular case.
     Section 5.—On double infinite series, in which the terms are     in
 finitely continued in both directions.
     It seems, in many different ways, that the series
        ... + p (r—2) + p (a   – 1) + pa + p (z+ 1) + p (z+2)--...
 can be resolved, by analytical transformation, into 0--0+0+0+...
 When there is no discontinuity whatever in the relation between
 q, a + p (a + 1)+... the value of the preceding is 0.      But when dis
 continuity does exist, the value of the series may be some other so
 lution of J. (a + 1) = \la. This assertion, derived from observation
 of instances, is here discussed in the case of
                -                        l

 the value of the double series is obtained, and some corresponding
 products of an infinite number of factors are deduced.

 COLOURING             MATTER OF FLINT, CARNELIAN AND AMETHYST.
    T appears from the experiments of W. Heintz, as stated in Pog
      gendorff's Annalen, that flint is coloured by organic matter,
carnelian by [per]oxide of iron, and amethyst by ferric acid.—Jame
son's Edinburgh Journal.
                                  ANTIRRHINIC            ACID.
   M. Morin gives this name to a soluble acid, procured, like the di
gitalic acid, from foxglove. It is obtained by distilling the leaves of
the plant with a large quantity of water, as long as the product has
any odour and reddens litmus paper.
   The distilled liquor is to be saturated with a slight excess of caustic
barytes, and then to be evaporated to dryness by the water-bath;
a product is obtained which resembles benzoin ; this is to be mixed
with an equal volume of oxalic acid, and distilled in a glass retort by
a water-bath; the product has a strong smell; water is to be added
to the retort, and distillation is to be repeated as long as the product
possesses a strong smell.
   The distilled liquors are to be rectified with chloride of calcium by
the water-bath; the first product is a saturated aqueous solution,
on the surface of which float oily drops of pure acid.
   The quantity of product obtained is very small, and the fresh
plant yields more than the dry.
   The properties of the antirrhinic acid thus obtained are, that it is
soluble, has an oily appearance, colourless, and reddens litmus paper
strongly; it dissolves in alcohol, and in contact with water it is con
verted into white pellicles, which are probably a hydrate, and it
eventually dissolves; its taste is disagreeable, and         smell resem     its

trated solution readily occasions head-ache, and may even produce
giddiness. The author observes that this acid strongly resembles
valerianic acid, and may possibly                   be
                                           identical with it.—Journ.                          de

tity of water; this is to be put into a silver crucible and boiled for
some time; the plumbic acid disappears by combining with the pot

crystals of plumbate of potash.

in pure water it forms a brown solution which contains biplumbate
of potash, and afterwards deposits hydrated plumbic acid. When

afterwards oxygen.

   ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE CRYSTALLIZED HYDRATES OF
               BARYTES AND STRONTI A. B.Y. M. FILHOL.
     Barytes and strontia both form two well-defined compounds with
 water; the first consists of an equivalent each of base and water,
 and is well known to all chemists: this is not the case with the
 crystallizable compound obtained by allowing a hot saturated solu
 tion of barytes or strontia to cool.
    According to Thenard and Berzelius, the crystallized hydrate of
 barytes contains 1 equivalent of barytes and 9 equivalents of water;
 the latter chemist indeed says that the crystals of hydrate of ba
 rytes contain so much water, that the quantity obtained is double
 that of the anhydrous barytes, which does not agree with preceding
 results; having occasion to learn the exact composition of the cry
 stallized hydrates of barytes and strontia, M. Filhol states that he
 prepared a considerable quantity of each, and submitted them to a
 careful analysis.
    One hundred parts of hydrate of barytes dried between sheets of
filtering paper, at the usual temperature, yielded in six analyses the
following quantities of sulphate of barytes:—
                     78-32 equivalent to 51.45 of barytes
                     78’40      ... ...         5 l'48      ...
                     78'27      ... ...          51'40
                     78°35      ... ...          51'45      ...
                     78°28      ...   ...        5 l'40      ...
                     78-34      ...   ...        51:45       -
These crystals were therefore formed of
                          Barytes . . . . . .        51-43
                          Water , , . . . . 48-57
                                                   100'
    If it be supposed that this hydrate is formed of 1 equivalent of
barytes and 8 equivalents of water, we shall obtain the following
numbers:–
                          Barytes .   . . . . .      51'46
                          Water     . . . . . .

                                                   100°
    This hydrate is therefore formed of Ba04-8HO.
    These crystals fuse in their water of crystallization with a slight
increase of temperature; it commences even at 212°; when more
strongly heated, they lose their water of crystallization.             Their den
sity at 60° is 2: 188.    M. Berzelius states it to be 4, which is cer
tainly an error, this being the density of the hydrate containing 2
equivalents of water.                                                      -
    The   hydrate  of strontia, according       to most    experiments,  is formed
of l equivalent of strontia and 12 equivalents of water, or of
                          Strontia. . . . . .       32.38

stals, but they are far from agreeing with the preceding; 100 parts
of crystallized hydrate of strontia having given a mean of 69.75 of
sulphate of strontia, which corresponds to
                                Strontia.              . . . . .           39' 17

  If we adopt the formula                    Sr0+9HO, we shall                             have these crystals
composed of—
                                    Strontia.          . . . . .           39.01

   The crystallized hydrate of strontia therefore contains 1 equivalent
of base and 9 equivalents of water;           density     60°        its
