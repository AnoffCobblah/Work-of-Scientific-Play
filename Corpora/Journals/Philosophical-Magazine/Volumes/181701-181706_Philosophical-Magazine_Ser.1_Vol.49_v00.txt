                           To Mr. Tillock.
Silt,    It  happens but seldom that a single chapter of a trea*
tise on any subject is so completely disengaged from the rest of
the work as to allow of its being published separately. There are
usually so many references, and dependences of one part on an
other, that, it will not admit of being detached.     The following,
however, is an exception.       It forms the tenth chapter of the
third volume of the Treatise on Experimental and Mathematical
Philosophy, lately published at Paris by M. Biot of the Insti
tute &c. : a work of very distinguished merit, having a consi
derable portion of its contents treated in a manner altogether
new, and containing deductions from the experiments of a most
interesting and important nature.
   The study of terrestrial magnetism has latterly declined very
much in this country; which is readily accounted for by the un
certainty attending most of its conclusions.        It excited great
interest, and indeed was one of the principal objects of pursuit,
in England,     about the end of the seventeenth and the com
mencement of the eighteenth century.
    Amongst a number of persons who have exerted themselves
in this department of knowledge we are particularly indebted to
Dr. Halley, who recommended the matter to the earnest atten
tion of Government, and after unwearied solicitation obtained per
mission for a ship to be fitted out and sent with him on a voyage
for the purpose of making magnetical observations. In this he re
peatedly traversed the Atlantic Ocean, and enriched various parts
 of nautical science with the fruits of his labour, as is abundantly
 testified by the numerous papers which he afterwards published
   Vol. 49. No. 225. Jan. 1817.               A 2                  in

in the Philosophical Transactions, the Miscellanea, Curiosa, and
other works.   On his return from this expedition, he combined
his own observations with those of others, and from them con
structed a chart, with the curve lines of the various degrees of
variation of the compass drawn upon          in directions corre
                                                           it,
 sponding with those on the surface of the earth.     The idea of
this chart was at that time perfectly new: and men of science
were led to imagine that the longitude might be discovered by
means of with sufficient accuracy for nautical purposes. Were
                  it
these lines permanent, or the changes which they undergo re
ducible to any calculable laws,       might be determined

within certain limits; but this        not the case: and although

brings before us the active labours of many ingenious indivi
duals yet;     has not been successful

                                                      in
 that present themselves in its application to the longitude.
      It  well known to philosophers, that there was a time when
           is
 the laws of the moon's motions were considered so inexplicable
 as to defy all human attempts to reduce them to any simple
 principles, capable of being applied for predicting her future-            si
 tuation for any given time with exactness: and the same could
 then be said of the tides, the orbits of comets, and various other
 particular parts of astronomy and natural philosophy: but                   by
 the unwearied diligence and researches of a few profound ma
 thematicians, this uncertainty respecting them now no longer
 exists.    There are, indeed, few things of this kind that cannot
 by degrees be brought to some system.           Empiric modes are
 first applied of explaining and computing the several motions               ;
  then       by
           investigating, comparing, and gradually approximating
 to the observations, we come at length to causes which rest on
  established principles, and ultimately every apparent anomaly              is
  accounted for,        by
                        reasonable and satisfactory theory.

of our knowledge of the changes that occur in the variation, that
  the situation of the lines before mentioned on the chart cannot
  be predicted for any distant future period: and consequently the
  method at present fails.          By combining the dip with the varia
  tion, a much greater degree of certainty will be given to it when
  the laws of both are better understood: and perhaps it will be
  still further improved by adding the intensity; or the num
  ber of vibrations which each of these needles makes in a given
  time: a property that was first noticed by our ingenious coun
  tryman Mr. George Graham, in the Philosophical Transaction^
  for 1725, p. 332.          At present, however, little or nothing can
  be done to forward the purpose in question, for want of sufficient
  observations and data, on which to establish a permanent theory.
      It will probably be asked, Why should we take pains to bring
  this method to perfection, which at best can only be an approxi-
,
  mation, when we possess so many others that are founded on
  principles not liable to uncertainty ?' The answer is plain and
  cogent : It ought on no account to be neglected, whilst there
  exists the least probability of its ever being applied to any use
  ful purpose, or whilst a single property of so curious a subject is
  not thoroughly understood.            By attempting to prove the exist
  ence of an annual parallax of the earth, the aberration of light
  and the nutation of the earth's axis were discovered : and is it
  possible to foretell that nothing will be found out by endea
  vouring to render magnetism of use to seamen ?                  Perhaps it
  may    be  found    to  form   some    connecting  link   in  the   chain of
  unexplained processes        that  are  always going   forward   in  the for
  mation and decomposition of mineralogic substances                    in the
  interior of the earth ; or perhaps it may account for certain
  actions in the arrangement of their particles, especially when
  ferruginous matter enters into the combination.               The cultiva
  tion of any department of knowledge affords pleasure : but to
  examine the operations of nature, to reduce them to system, and
  to bring her laws to light, is certainly the most exalted exercise
  which the human mind, in its present imperfect state, is capable
  of enjoying.       If the longitude cannot he found by      it,   there will
  bea    gratificationin     having the cause of its failure satisfactorily
  explained.       Till then
                           it     cannot be relinquished without regret.
  Perhaps    even   the  attempt to show its impracticability may elicit
  some    new   idea,  or  lead us to combine  it    with some extraneous
  principle or science, which may render         it    effectual for the pur-
 in the Atlantic Ocean within   a    trifle by the dead reckoning, to proceed
 along the shortest and most expeditious track by informing them what va
 riation they are to, allow in the courses which they ought to steer.

pose. Attempts to square the circle have been made without
number ; and persons might longer have continued to waste time
and talents in this fruitless inquiry, had not Lambert at length
demonstrated its impossibility in a rational form*.
     In the following Memoir a general view is given, by its inge
nious author, of all the most material properties that are known
on the subject of terrestrial magnetism.       Some new and curious
mathematical results respecting the inflexions of the magnetic
equator, and the lines of no variation and dip, are derived from
the observations made in different parts of the world; and an
hypothesis is proposed for explaining them, which, if not quite
correct and satisfactory, at least represents the magnetic actions,
and their modifications, in a way that cannot easily be contro
verted, until further discoveries shall have made us better ac
quainted with their causes.
     It is earnestly wished that astronomers, travellers, captains of
ships, and other gentlemen who possess the necessary instru
ments, would continue these researches, and publish theirobserva-
tions; for it is only by discussing a series of them, made in a
 great number of places, and continued for a long period of time,
 that we can expect to arrive at a complete knowledge of the laws
 of magnetic attraction over the whole surface of the earth.
     Particular requests might be given to the commanders of ves
sels in the service of His Majesty, the East India and other pub
 lic and private companies, to determine these data as often as
the weather and circumstances will admit.         Not only should the
 dip and variation be taken, but the number of oscillations also
 of both these needles in ten minutes, commencing at a certain
 distance from zero, as was begun by Mr. George Graham, and
 continued by Humboldt and Rossel.             It has been proved by
 the experiments of Mr. Canton, that the temperature of the
 atmosphere has a sensible influence on the variation of a needle ;
  and he accounts for the diurnal alterations by means of it ; but
 whether the density, or any of the other modifications of the
 atmosphere, besides aurora borealis, and lightning, will alter
 its direction, cannot in the-present state of our knowledge be
  ascertained : it will therefore be proper to note down the baro
 meter and thermometer, at least, with the latitude and lon
 gitude of the place of observation at the time of making each
 experiment.       Considerable difficulty will be met with occasion
  ally in taking them at sea, on account of the action of the iron
 which there is in the ship, the instability of the water, and other
  causes : but perhaps the method now generally adopted, of sus-

pending marine barometers in gimbals, just above the centre of
gravity, may, under certain modifications, be applied with ad
vantage to these compasses, in keeping them steady when the
sea is rough.       The mean of a number of observations will give
the dip and variation with tolerable exactness, even when little
dependence can be placed on a single attempt. They can always
be taken on land, with all the accuracy that the nature of the
 subject admits, provided the ship remain at anchor a sufficient
 time for the purpose.
     Exclusive of any view to utility, the subject, like all the other
 operations of nature, is in itself extremely curious ; and, it is pre
 sumed, will amply repay, with interesting and amusing novelties,
 whatever trouble may attend its cultivation. With so great a pro
 bability of its becoming useful in the important art of conduct
 ing ships from one part of the world to another, or of its lead
 ing to useful discoveries in the ceconomy of nature, by explaining
 the causes of important changes in the mineralogic and geo
 logic departments, it cannot but recommend itself strongly to
 the attention of all those who feel pleasure in the advancement
 of useful scientific knowledge.

  On the   Laws    of Terrestrial Magnetism in different Latitudes.
  w     e have mentioned elsewhere, that the dip, the variation,
  and the intensity    of the magnetic force, are not the same in all
  parts  of  the earth.     We now possess all the necessary processes
  for giving   the  present state of these phenomena with exactness.
  It is only requisite to carry with us. to different places the same
  magnetic needle, or others that are capable of being compared
  together, and to observe the three elements or data above named
  in those places.
      This great experiment was undertaken about the year 1700,
  by the celebrated astronomer Dr. Halley, to whom the English
  Government gave the command of a vessel for the purpose
  of carrying him and his instruments to different parfs of the
  globe. But the researches of Dr. Halley having for their ob
  ject the determination of the longitude of places by means of
  the variation of the compass, he confined himself principally
   to observe this element, which unfortunately appears to be the
   most variable of the three.        So that, if we wish to describe
   the present state of terrestrial magnetism, we are obliged to
                                      A 4                          have

9             On the haws       of Terrestrial Magnetism
have recourse to the detached observations of more modem
navigators.       But the needles which they have made use of not
admitting of comparison one with another, and their methods
of observing not being the same, it is conceived that these dif
ferences must produce many apparent anomalies in the results ;
and, therefore, we can at most only hope to find out the general
circumstances of these phenomena, without being able to esti
mate them in detail.         Lastly, what increases these difficulties
still further  is, that we are wholly in want of observations, made
in a great part of the globe, where they are so much the more
necessary, as the whole of the facts appear to indicate there the
action of some extremely remarkable local causes, of which               it   is
impossible to form an idea, except from the experiments them
selves.    For this reason,     I must here confine myself to point
out merely what        at present known of the general facts of these
                      is
phenomena, without undertaking to connect them                  by
                                                                 calcula
tions, for which the most essential data are wanting.          This will
be sufficient to inform navigators of the places on the globe
where   it would be most useful for them to direct their attention
and to increase their observations.
    I shall first consider the inequalities of the magnetic dip in
different climates of the earth       ;because this phenomenon ap
pears to vary with time, much less than the variation.          The first
thing to be done, in order to discover some of its laws,       to deter
                                                               is
mine the points on the globe where the dip           nothing or where
                                                     is        ;
a  needle,  that is  perfectly horizontal    before  being magnetized,
still keeps the same position afterwards.           The series of these
points form a curve line on the surface of the earth, which                   is
called the magnetic equator, and which all authors have hitherto
considered as great circle, inclined in an angle of about twelve
                a
degrees to the terrestrial equator.       This, indeed,   is what     inis
dicated  by   all the observations made on an extent of more than
1 80° of longitude     inthe Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Sea, and that
part of the South Sea which washes the coasts of South America.
To explain this, let M'M" (Plate           fig.

    This equation will determine x; that is the longitude of the
 node of the great circle from any fixed meridian A M, and the
 other will determine M' N' E', or the inclination of the magnetic
 equator* to the terrestrial equator. Now, if all the observations
 made in different parts of the world, when combined two and
 two, give nearly the same values always for x and i, we mav
 conclude that the magnetic equator is a great circle of the ter
 restrial globe, at least in the extent embraced by the ob^rva-
 tions which we have used.      To show how far this indication is
 satisfactory, I have computed the following table :

10              On the Laws        of Terrestrial Magnetism
    The agreement of these results is certainly very remarkable.
We appear to be well authorized in concluding that the mag
netic equator is really a great circle of the terrestrial sphere, in
clined to the equator in an angle of about 12°, and having its
western node situated at about 1150U4' of west longitude from
Paris* ; that is, in the South Sea a few degrees from the island
of Gallego, at nine hundred leagues from the coast of Peru. This
 places the opposite node in 295,;, 34' of west longitude.            Such
indeed has hitherto        been  the general opinion.     But what   is ex
traordinary, these elements are wholly defective, in all that part
 of the South Sea, situated below the western node between 115°
 and 2701 of longitude, which comprehends nearly a whole hemi
sphere of sea.         Indeed, in discussing some observations made
jvith the utmost care by Captain Cook and Mr. Bayly, in two
 different vessels which sailed together in the South Sea, in 1 777,
 1 find that they have both of them met with the magnetic equa
tor in 158° 5& 9" of west longitude, and in 3° 13' 40" of south
latitude ; whereas, by prolonging the great circle, that our first
observations have given us, this equator ought then to have been
found in north latitude 8° 36' 30".              This shows us, therefore,
 that the magnetic equator, after having crossed the terrestrial
 equator, at about 115° of west longitude, descends again into
 the southern part of the globe : and as the observations of Mr.
 Bayly which are confirmed by those of Mr. Dalrymple, show
 likewise that this line is without dip in about 7° of north lati
 tude in the Chinese sea, at 256° of west longitude, we must con
 clude, that between this longitude and that of 158° 50' deter
mined by the observations of Captain Cook, the magnetic
 equator and the terrestrial equator have at least one more inter
 section, independently of the eastern node, situated in the Indian
 Sea, at about 295° of longitude, and dependent on the circular
part. There are therefore in all at least three nodes, and per
 haps four, if the magnetic equator, near its western node, rise
 a little towards the north, before it descends again into the
 south, near the archipelago of the Society Islands.           Fig. 2, re
 presents   the   series  of these  inflexions, of which we shall presently
 find some striking confirmations in the effects we shall derive.
     In examining the magnetic dips observed on both sides the
 line just traced, we find that they increase in proportion as they
 recede from it.        If we confine ourselves to consider that half of
 the globe where the magnetic equator appears to be exactly cir
 cular, and which comprehends Europe, Africa, the Atlantic
 Ocean, and the eastern coasts of the two Americas, we find that
    * Paris is 9' 21" of time to the eastward of Greenwich, or 2° 20' 15" of
 space; consequently this node is in 113° 14' of west longitude from the
 Royal Observatory of Greenwich.
                                                                        the

                               in different Latitudes.                                             11
the dip remains nearly constant           on the parallels situated at
equal distances   on both   sides  this equator : so that, by following
this law, the maximum        of dip takes place in two opposite points
of the earth, of which the one situated towards the north will
be found in about 25 degrees of west longitude, and (90° 12a
or) 78" of north latitude ; whilst the other, diametrically op
posite to      it,
               will have 205° of west longitude, and 78° of south
latitude.
    Here, therefore, are the poles of the magnetic equator and                                ;
such indeed are. approximately the positions that Philosophers
have before assigned to them *.              But      we confine our      if
selves to the consideration of that half of the earth where the
 laws of the dip appear to be the most simple, we may proceed
 far beyond these general indications.           For we can represent
 these dips within     trifle in numbers,

 ward on a parallel of latitude about 65° since the beginning of 1600, and
 concludes that    makes

 12             On the    Laws of Terresrlrial Magnetism
    This formula requires that      we  know how to calculate    A'. Let
AE     be the terrestrial equator (fig. 3) ;   NE'  the magnetic equa
tor (supposed     in  like manner to be a great circle), and M the
given place on the globe, having for its longitude AE=Z, and
for its geographic latitude ME=A.           If from this point we draw
the arc of a great circle M E' perpendicular to the magnetic
equator, this arc will express the magnetic latitude of M. Now
as we know the longitude AN, or a, of the node of the magnetic
equator; expressing it by a, we shall haveNE = / a. Thus
in the spheric triangle MNE, right angled at E, we know the
two sides NE, ME: we may therefore compute the hypothenuse
MN, or H, and the angle N, by these formule :
                                                             X
          cos H  as cos A ccs  (I
                               v    a) and tang°  N= sinta"f
                                                          (i a)
The angle N being thus known, we add to it the angle of in
clination I of the two equators, and we get the angle MNE'.
Then in the triangle MNE', the arc ME', or A'= the magnetic
latitude of the point M will be obtained by the formula
                       sin a'= sin H. sin (N + I).
    Now let us compute these for Paris.
    Here the longitude l=o ; the latitude A=48° 50' 14" ; NE
or I a will be 64° 26'; that is to say, equal to the longitude of
the eastern node of the magnetic equator.          With these data we
find
      H = 73° 29' 10"; N = 51° 44' 10"; and A' = 59° 20' 10".
Lastly, with this value of a', computing i+A', and i, we find
     i + A'=132°     49'  20"; and consequently 1=73" 29' 10'.
This is therefore the dip of the magnetic needle at Paris,
according to our formula : direct experiments give it about
70°.
    Our formula, therefore, gives      a very simple relation between
the observed dips near the magnetic equator.            Indeed, in thjs
case i and A are very small quantities.          By confining ourselves
to their first powers, we may consider cos 2a as equal to 1 ; and
we may substitute for' tang (i + A'), and for sin 2a, the arcs
which correspond to them. Then the formula is reduced to
                                  i = 2A';
that is to say, each dip is double the corresponding magnetic
 latitude. This property is found to be completely substantiated
in all the observations made at a little distance from the mag
netic equator, between the longitudinal limits where it is ap
 parently circular.
    For example ;     At Tompenda in Peru, M. Humboldt observed
                                                                     th$

                             in different Latitudes.                    13
the   dip to be 3*   1 1'   42", which gives   X' or the magnetic latitude
of Tompenda equal to 1" 35' 36".     By calculating           it from its
geographic position, we obtain 1° 28' 55".
    Another example : At Quito in Peru, the magnetic latilude com
puted according to the geographic position is         X'=s 6° 33.' 10''
    Doubling  it  we  get  the dip       . .    . .   i s= 13 6 20
    Humboldt found it by observation            . .   i = 13 21 54
    The observations of La Perouse and Lacaille near the mag
netic equator, in the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Sea, being
reduced in the same manner, present us with results which agree
in a similar way with the formula.         Unfortunately these simple
laws do not extend to the opposite side of the globe, which is                '
affected by the inflexions of the magnetic equator.            If we at
tempt to apply the exact formula to some one of the southern
 islands of the South Sea,  to Otaheite, for example, where Cap
 tain Cook so often observed,  we find the southern dips far too
 great; and on the contrary, in countries situated in North Ame
 rica, nearly in the same longitude, the computed dips are much
 too small. These deviations result necessarily from the inflexion,
 which in this part of the globe brings the magnetic equator
 towards the south pole j and they give a striking confirmation
 of it.
    To agree with these phenomena, it is therefore necessary to
 suppose some perturbating local cause to exist near the archipe
 lago of the South Sea, such as a particular centre of magnetic
forces, which influences them in this hemisphere and modifies
 the central action.        Indeed, by adopting this supposition it
 makes all the results agree : and they only require a very weak
 force in the secondary centre, which derives almost the whole of
 its energy from its proximity.       But before we try to define and
 measure   it,we must consider attentively the alterations that the
variation of the needle and the intensity of the magnetic forces
experience in different latitudes.       For these phaenomena, being
also the results of the magnetic action of the earth, must be taken
into consideration,        we would account for them completely.
                            if
    To understand the dips, we began              by
                                                  seeking the series of
 places  where   they  are  nothing.  In  the same way, to discuss the
 phaenomena of the variations, we must begin           by
                                                       finding the points
 on the globe where they also are nothing.           The series of these
 points form what are called lines of' no variation*.               These
 lines do not follow the direction of the geographic meridians on
 the globe, but are very oblique to them          j and they present us
   * The
         necessary elements for this discussion were furnished     by M. de
 Humboldt.
                                                                       with

 14                On the Laws     of Terrestrial Magnetism
 with some very irregular inflexions.          According to the most re
 cent observations, there exists at present a line of no variation
 in the Atlantic Ocean between the old and the new world.                          It
 cuts the meridian of Paris, near the south latitude of 65° ; from
 this it proceeds in a NNVV direction towards about 35° of west
 longitude, whence it reaches as high up as the coasts of Para
 guay; then, after going on nearly north and south, it runs along
 the coasts of Brasil, and thus proceeds to the latitude of Ca
 yenne : but then turning suddenly to the NW, it directs its
 course towards the United States, and thence towards the other
 northern parts of the continent of America, which it traverses in
 the same direction. '
    The position of this line of no variation is not fixed on the
 globe ; at least it has not been so during the last Century and a
 half ; but has moved considerably from the east towards the
 west.    It passed through London in 1657, and through Paris in
 1664*. So that, according to its present direction, it has de
 scribed about 80c of longitude in 150 years along this parallel. But
 there is no doubt that this alteration is not uniform in its mo
tion : it    is,indeed, very unequal        indifferent parallels  at Ja;
maica,   for   example,    the variation  has   not  experienced any sen
 sible change for 140 years.        In general, according to the pre
sent slowness of this motion, we are not certain that              always
                                                                       it   is
progressive, nor that         proceeds in any given direction.
                             it                                     These
are things that time alone can bring to light.
    Some very accurate observations of the dip, made at different
times   by  the Honourable Mr. Cavendish and Mr. Gilpin in Lon
don, have proved that this element           likewise variable, although
                                             is
much less so than the variation.         In 1775, the dip in London
was 72° 30': in 1805,          was 70° 21'.
                              it                  This has also been con
firmed in France        bythe experiments of M. Humboldt.
    There exists another band having no variation nearly oppo
site the preceding one this runs in a continued direction to the
                             :
NW, takes its commencement in the great South Sea, cuts the
western point of New Holland, traverses the Indian Sea, enters
the continent of Asia at Cape Comorin, and thence passing
across Persia and Siberia westward, rises up towards Lapland.
But what      is very remarkable, this line bifurcates near the great
archipelago     of   Asia, and gives rise to another branch, which,
directing    itself  almost  wholly from south to north, passes this
archipelago,      crosses China, and returns into itself again in the
eastern part of Siberia.       The existence of this branch, and its
separation from the preceding one, are clearly pointed out                        by
observations made in the Chinese seas.              But am enabled to

present a still more certain confirmation of it in the variations
observed in Russia, and on the frontiers of China, by the cele
brated astronomer Schubert, who has been so kind as to com-
Iriunicate them to me. For, having gone in the summer of 1 805
from Casan to Tobolsk, and from Tobolsk to Irkutsk, he met the
two branches we have just described, one after another in their
northern parts, wheie they are widest asunder. This is clearly
pointed out by his observations, which I feel it my duty to re
cord here.

     The two branches which compose this line either never move,
 or move very slowly.            It is certain that the variation has not
 altered at New Holland during the last 140 years.
      Some indications are also to be found of a fourth line, without
 any variation.        It was observed by Captain Cook in the South
 Sea, near the point of the greatest inflexion of the magnetic
 equator.        This line h?s not been discovered by navigators
 further towards the north ; but it is extremely probable that it
 is continued there : for, according to a very just remark made
 by M. Humboldt, since on both sides of each line of no varia
 tion, the variation changes its sign from east to west, it neces
 sarily follows, that on the whole surface of the globe the num
 ber of lines without variation must be even, that it may fall again
 on the same sign, after all the alternations from plus to minus
                                                                                f.

     f  This will be easily understood by inspecting fig. 5. The circle A is
  divided into three parts: and if we mark the first arc CD with the
 sign + ; the second DE with  ; and the third EC with + t the first and
  last arcs will have the same sign, which is not according to nature.           On
  the contrary, in the circle B, which is divided in
                                                         Jour parts, if we mark the
  first FG with + ; the second with            ; the third with + ; and the fourth
  with  ; there will be a regular alternation of the signs in proceeding round

   Having determined the direction of the lines without varia
tion, it is necessary to fix the other limits of the phenomena,
that     is,
           to trace the series of places where the variation                                 is
greatest.    In this we find lines quite as irregular, which inter
pose themselves between the former.        The greatest of all the
variations that have been observed in the southern hemisphere,

  (t    Sir,  The
                subject of our national Money appears to me                                  a
matter of such very great importance, that although at this time
the figure. Now this will always be the case when the number of divisions
of the circle  even
                  is but   ;will be otherwise when the number of them
                                    it                                                        is
odd.   It therefore extremely probable, that there are on the surface of
             is
the earth an even number of lines of no variation, as Humboldt has re
marked.
                                                                                    exceedingly

                 A Decimal   Scale   of Money  proposed.          17
exceedingly engaged, in preparing to leave town, I have taken
the liberty of drawing up a Paper of suggestions, and inclosing
two copies to you, for explaining the very simple, easy and use
ful improvement that might be made, in our small Money system ;
Units, Tens, Hundreds, Thousands, Millions, &c. of Pounds, re
quiring no change whatever, nor should any whatever be at
tempted, as to them.
     " I shall feel most particularly obliged if you would hand or
inclose these Papers, to such of His Majesty's Ministers as they
most concern, and render the public as well as me, all the service
you can, towards accomplishing this object, which I feel confi
dent, will meet ready and general approbation.  I particularly
hope, that the English Names of Pound, Tenth, Hundredth, and
 Thousandth may be adopted for the Coins, without Latin or other
 foreign prefixes to the word Pound; because, when new Measures
 and Weights are introduced, they should have foreign prefixes
 (and I hope those used in France) as they must have double or com
pound Names, to distinguish the four various classes ; viz. Mea
 sures oflengt h, of surface, of solidity, and Weight ; yet for our
 Money, if English Names are used, they need not, in common
 use at least, be compound, or have Pound added, but Tenth, may
 always mean 2s. Hundredth, the -J^th of this, and Thousandth,
 the new substitute for Farthing.
     "  I hope it will not be too late, in part at least of the in
 tended issue of new Shillings and Sixpences, to put on them
 the inscriptions,    5 Hundredths,    and 25 Thousandths, respec
 tively ; as this would be of very considerable use, and could do no
 possible harm.

    " Mr.  Farey*s Suggestions, as to the issue of Decimal Money.
     "  Mr. Farey senior (of 37, Howland-street, Fitzroy-square)
  in a Report to the Board of Agriculture on Derbyshire, the 3rd
 volume of which is now just printed, and will, as he expects, be
  published in a few days, has entered into the subject of Measures,
  Weights, and Money, with somewhat different, and as he hopes
  considerably more practicable views, than many others have
 done.  In pp. 465 and 466 (printed off in March last) his ob
 servations as to Money, are as follows ; viz."
     '
       Lastly; as to Money, we fortunately now use in Accounts,
  only the four denominations, Pounds, Shillings, Pence, and
 Farthings; amongst these, the Pound Sterling is so much more
 generally and importantly used, than either of the other three
 denominations, that no hesitation can take place, in proposing
  this as the unit of Money, or circulating medium of value ; and
 fortunately, Two Shillings is the exact ^th of this unit, as fol
  lows ; viz.

                                      (TVth of two Shillings, or of 48
half-pence), is so near to 5 half-pence, and -ji^th of these last
being a Farthing, no serious inconvenience or injustice could
follow, on the enacting of the above decimal divisions of the
Pound, by appropriate names, and issuing Coin corresponding
thereto, to permit, for one or two years, a Farthing to pass (in
change only), for -^y^dth of a Pound, and 5 half-pence (or 2^d
of the present coin), instead of the T-^dth of a Pound, before the
present Copper Money need wholly be called in ; and so, with
out any harm, Sixpences, Shillings, Eighteenpences, Half-Crowns,
and Three-Shilling Pieces, might, for a time at least, continue
to circulate with the new Decimal Coin, as the 2^-lOOdths,

of the Pound Sterling.

forming the Measures and Weights, on similar principles.'
     "   And in the concluding Chapter, p. 681, Note, now printing
 off (14th June), after some remarks in favour of proposing and
 adopting decimal scales, and these only, whenever Weights,
 Measures and Monies shall be attempted to be altered, from their
 present denominations, his remarks are as follows ; viz."
      ' The call now
                        (June 1S16) so strongly expressed, for a Coin
 age     of Pound   Pieces  of Gold, instead of Guineas (which once
 prevailed amongst us) comes most opportunely, for the adoption
 abovementioned; and I would beg earnestly to press on the atten
 tion of His Majesty's Ministers, the propriety and the great advan
 tages which will result, from accompanying the issue of these new
 Pound-pieces, by moderate numbers of Tenth-pieces, Hundredth-
 pieces, and Thousandth-pieces, of a Pound, for circulation, alono
 with the present (or new) Silver and Copper Coins, as recom^
 mended in p. 465, until the Public are fully habituated to their
  relations, and see by use, the utility of a decimal scale
                                                              of Money,

  I hope, it will also do, with all our Weights and Measures.'

  20              Decimal Scales      of Money   proposed.
      "  Mr. Farey   has  little wish to go further at present, (or very
  little)than offering   this  plan and the four new Coins, to the Public*
  for their acceptance and adoption, reserving further proceedings
  thereon, until a complete decimal scale of Measures, and W eights
  also is matured, and in action ; and therefore, it would, he sug
  gests, be proper to enact,
      " 1st. That no persons should be entitled to demand any of
  the new decimal Coins, instead of the present legal ones, if such
  are tendered.
      " 2d. That a Pound-piece, might legally be tendered and given
  in payment, instead or in lieu of 20 shillings.
      " 3d. That a Tenth-piece might be tendered and given instead
   of Two Shillings, or of 4 Six-pences, or of 24 Pence, &c.
      " 4th. That a single Hundred-piece might be given in lieu of
  Twopence-halfpenny,          or 10 Farthings; two of such for five-
  pence, or 20 Farthings; three of such and a one Thousandth-piece
  for sevenpence-halfpenny, or 6 pence and 3 halfpence; four of
  such and a one Thousandth-piece for Tenpence, or 6 pence and
  4 pence ; and beyond which         number of four Hundredth-pieces,
  in any one payment, no person should be compellable to take
  them, instead of the present Coins.
      *' 5th. That a
                      single Thousandth-piece might be given in lieu of
  a Farthing, two of such for a half-penny, three of such for three
  Farthings, and so on, to ten of such Thousandth-pieces (which
  together are equivalent to Twopence-halfpenny,        within less than
  the half a farthing), beyond which number of ten Thousandth-
  pieces, no person should be compellable to take them, instead of
  the present Coins.
      " Mr. Farey begs further to remark^ that his proposal, as
  above, has no dependance on the questions, as to how great a
  weight of Gold, of Silver, or of Copper, or how fine, should be
i put into the four new Coins, respectively; as he assumes, that
  the Pound will nominally and legally, be equal to 20 shillings,
  2i0 pence, and 960 Farthings respectively; and the new Coin,
  exact decimations of each other. .
      " He cannot avoid expressing a hope, that no propositions
  will be listened to, for destroying all our present Coins and the
  Pound sterling with them, in favour of exact aliquot parts of a
  Troy pound of Gold, or of Silver, or the like ; much less, the
  still more improper proposal of some, for destroying all theee,
  except the Farthing, in order from this very trifling unit, rather
                                                                '
  than the Pound Sterling, to raise a decimal scale of Monies,
  which in the ordinary transactions of business, would from the
  greatness of the numbers, be intolerable, and how much more so
  in the Public accounts ?"

   " Sir,  The    objection which you so strongly stated in our
last conversation, to the introduction of the decimals of the
Pound sterling ; viz. that Persons whose dealings were wholly
effected in Copper Money, without the aid of Silver Coin (which
is a very extreme case) would lose 10 pence in every Pound
Sterling, or 4-g- per cent, by taking Thousandths of a Pound in
lieu of Farthings,  has suggested to me a remedy, which I beg
now to submit for your consideration : viz. That a new denomi
nation, and small Coin should be temporarily introduced, which
might be called Mites, each -JTth part of a Farthing in value,
which would admit of calculations, and payments being made,
and of accounts being kept in 3 columns            s.    as at present,                                                                                                                                                                                J.
or exactly equivalent calculations, payments, and accounts, in
two new Columns, Pound-decimals and Mites, or                 M. as in                                                                                                                                                                                                 £.

One Tenth, makes Twopence-halfpenny ; and with Two Tenths,

values of these temporary Coins, would be soon understood by
every one, and the above Coins would suffice, for readily making
 up any exact sum required.
    " As fast as bargains and dealings came to be made in the De

be laid aside ; and after a sufficient time, when this came to be
 almost wholly the case, in consequence of further issues of the
new Coin, all the present Coin might be called in, and the use
of three troublesome columns in accounts, wholly done away ;

without any reduction, for multiplying by its quantity of a com

need any reduction, advantages that would be incalculable, in a
trading and scientific community.

 III.   On the Article in our last Number, entitled" Controversy
         concerning Safe-lamps."      By W. P. Knight, Esq.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
Sib,      I  perused, with a certain degree of surprise, an article
 in your excellent Magazine, entitled " Controversy concerning
Safe-lamps," which you introduce by expressing an opinion
that "you had conceived that the discoveries of Sir H. Davy
and Mr. George Stevenson were made independent of each
other.3'     I do not think the question of dates so near to each
other of any importance ; and I am still inclined to think that
Mr. Stevenson began, without knowing what Sir H. Davy was
doing, though he probably did hear that he Was engaged in the
 inquiry.
    When I first saw the account of Mr. G. Stevenson's lamp in the
Philosophical Magazine, I had an idea that it was a lamp which
might burn safely in explosive atmospheres : but having seen the
lamp during a journey that I made in the north of England
this summer, I was obliged to give up this opinion ; and since
I have read Mr. R. W. Brandling's letter, 1 am convinced that
Mr. Stevenson never made any discovery, and that there         is not
the slightest analogy between what he attempted and that which
Sir H. Davy discovered and carried into execution.
    It is said " that Mr. G. Stevenson had conceived an idea that
hydrogen gas might be admitted into a lamp so as to be gra
dually consumed."        If any thing be meant by this idea, it must
be    that explosive mixtures admitted into a lantern in small

24              On the     Article in our last Number, entitled
quantities at a time, will not explode, but be gradually consumed
by combustion  which is utterly false.          Whatever quantity of
explosive gas   is admitted   to the contact  of flame, it will explode,
that      is,will burn at once, and not be gradually consumed
            it                                                                              ;
and   inthe wire-gauze safe-lamp the whole cylinder           filled with  is
flame.
    But on this erroneous idea Mr. G. Stevenson,                 said, en it   is
deavoured to construct       safe-lampa     First, by admitting air
                                                     :                                      by
one tube, then       three tubes (which Mr. R. Brandling calls ca
                       by
pillary, though   no dimensions   are stated), and last of all^        row            by

                                          is
in public.       It on this, therefore, that
                      is                         shall make my obser

cate explosion     the glass cylinder was loose, and there was no
                   :
thing to prevent the communication of explosion through it.
I  never heard that this lamp was exposed to any other proof
than that of sending pure fire-damp into                       it,
                                                    which would extin

                                                    it
to the outward atmosphere.           shall now say something of Sir
                                               I
 H.Davy's principles, which were made known to scientific men,
and pretty generally communicated, whilst Mr. G. Stevenson's
were in embryo, or confined to the Killingworth Colliery.
    Sir H. Davy's first idea of a safe-lamp was founded on dis                       a
covery which he made  that           very small admixture of azote
                                               a
prevented the explosion of detonating mixtures of fire-damp*.
 Hence he made         light burn in a close lamp supplied with
                           a                                                                a
limited quantity of air; and when this air was further deteriorated
 by  an admixture of fire-damp the light was extinguished.            This
 lamp, though the principle of        was strictly philosophical, could
                                               it
not have been very useful, for          must have been extinguished
                                                it
 by   avery slight admixture of fire-damp in air.
 I    must, however, vindicate this first principle of Sir H. Davy
 against an enlightened and liberal advocate of his cause, the Rev.
 John Hodgson, who says that Mr. John Murray thought of a
 diminished atmosphere: whereas, as far as             can learn fromI
 the perusal of his modest and luminous little treatise, he only
 anticipated his namesake (Dr.(Murray) and Mr. R. W. Brandling
in  the idea of tube for bringing the air from
                   a                                    distance.     a

     The great principle of security that Sir         H. Davy discovered,               is,
that certain cooling surfaces used for transmitting gas destroy
the power of communicating explosion.     To this no other per
son can  lay claim and  :  required great sagacity, and multiplied
                            it
and  varied experiments, to trace this principle from its opera
tion in long metallic tubes and canals, to that in      tissue per  a
meable to light and air, and impermeable to flame.
   Capillary tubes or narrow canals, as Sir H. Davy has shown,
are not safe as such.    He has demonstrated that their power of
preventing   the passage of explosion depends upon their number                         :
nor are numerous small apertures safe, unless they exist in a
whole surface. The explosion of hydrogen,         well known, will
                                                          it   is
pass through an aperture of l-70th of an inch in diameter, or
through a glass tube l-40th of an inch diameter and six inches
long.
     Mr. R. W. Brandling        is   of opinion   that wire-gauze        is   onlv the
extremities of capillary tubes  this opinion
                                       :        too ridiculous to
                                                               is
merit serious notice.       Itsingular that Mr. R. W. Brandling
                                 is
has not discovered the principle of the wire-gauze safe-lamp in
the  common wire firescreen.        According to such analogical
reasoning,   the steam-engine   would  be only the prolongation of
a teakettle, and the air-pump an improvement of the wet leather
used     children for raising smooth stones.

voice.
     Mr. R. W. Brandling    himself the constructor of
                                 is                         rival             a
lamp, and on such an occasion he cannot be regarded as       very              a
unprejudiced advocate, or even witness     and, except to those
                                                      ;
who are very ignorant of the most common principles of che
mistry, there can be no question of analogy between the at
tempts of Mr. Stevenson, as they have been justly called      the                 by
committee of the coal trade (however laudable), and the scientific
discoveries  of Sir H. Davy.
     Mr. G. Stevenson may (as Mr. Hodgson     says in his candid
and gentleman-like communications) be       very modest and in
                                                      a

 the late progress of chemical philosophy, that the discoverer of
 the laws of electrical decomposition ; of the composition of the
 alkalies, earths and acids, supposed to be simple ; of the inde
 pendence of the supporters of combustion; should have developed
 a new chemical principle with respect to flame : or that he
 should have accomplished an object on which he was employed
 with great zeal and unwearied industry for some months.
    Though I have taken great pleasure in chemical inquiries, I am
not known as a publisher; nor should I have volunteered any ob
 servations on this occasion, had I not been deeply penetrated by
the greatness of the benefits conferred on humanity by the in
vention of the wire-gauze safe-lamp, during an examination that
 I made of some of the mines in the neighbourhood of Newcastle.
 I saw some hundreds of the lamps in the hands of the miners,
 who spoke of them with a mixture of gratitude and affection
under'the name of Davies.         I should feel unworthy of perusing
works of philosophy, if I did not find my heart glow at such a
sight, and if I did not feel some indignation when I hear the
merits of such a benefactor to society depreciated.
    Our great English chemical philosopher by his various bril
liant discoveries laid long ago the foundation for an unperishable
fame ; and if his discovery of the chemical agencies of electricity
be regarded as the solid base of the column of his scientific glory,
the discoveries which terminated in the safe-lamp may be re
garded as its Corinthian capital, equally beautiful and useful j
and this column will stand " untouched by time," when the
rubbish and dirt which envy and jealousy heap around it shall
decay and disappear : and even should this generation neglect
it, posterity will not fail to crown   with civic garlands, in which
                                         it
the evergreen oak and laurel are blended, emblems of a triumph
of genius and labour over one of the most destructive agents with
which humanity had ever to contend.

IV.   On Vision: in Answer           to Mr. Pater. By Mr. Andrew
                                     Horn.
                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,  Whether         the ignorance and inconsistency manifested
by Mr. Pater, in your number for November,     be real or assumed,
isof little importance. One thing certain, that "good humour"
                                        is
never can atone for these blemishes in any writer.      hazard the

assertion, that there     not one among the numerous readers of
                          is

                             On Vision.
the Philosophical Magazine, except Mr. P., that would confound
"   my idea" of the manner in which vision is accomplished, with
that of " his friend," who seems to have understood nearly as
much of optics as himself. Much as it may surprise Mr. P., I can
assure him, that my theory is verily built upon his " old opinion,
that light acts upon the optic nerve, and excites sensation" 
there, and not upon the retina.
    In my former communication (No. 220, p. 1 1 7), I merely stated
the principle of my theory, and introduced an experiment which
 I had made in support of that principle. Should any gentleman
scientifically answer my arguments, and invalidate the experi
ments adduced in the pamphlet, where the theory is fully deve
loped,! should at once renounce it as an untenable hypothesis; but
till then I am warranted in retaining an opinion sanctioned by high
philosophical authority, that
                                 " the phenomena are more philoso
phically explained by this theory than any hitherto proposed."
    In the whole circle of science, no theory has obtained more
admiration than that of light and colours, as established by New
ton upon his experiments with the prism.          But it certainly owes
more to    the mathematical genius of its author than to the truth
 of its physical principles.      He assumes it as a first principle,
supported by mathematical calculation, that the prismatic spec
 trum is an image of the sun ; and then proceeds, with the same
rigid adherence to mathematical demonstration, to show, that
 the prism decomposes the rays that enter the foramen in the win
 dow-shutter, so as to produce a spectrum whose length is about
 five times its breadth, and composed of seven colours.             This
 altogether is taken as a demonstration that light is composed
 of so many different kinds of rays, that differ in refrangibility in
 the same order in which they stand to the refringent angle of the
 prism. In the formation of the spectrum we are to suppose an
 infinite number of circles, composed of rays differently refran
 gible, and projected a little beyond each other, so that the as
 semblage of circles forms an oblong image, the extremities only
 of which are circular.
    But the principle is fallacious, that supposes the prismatic spec
 trum to be an image of the sun, when it is evidently an image of
 the hole in the window-shutter,      with its polarized light. As for
 the lengthening of the spectrum, there is no proof that the rays
 are decomposed and separated by the prism.            The fact is,  that
  the prism modifies the direction of the rays coming from the
  aperture, which otherwise would be dispersed     ;    so that, so faris
  the prism from decomposing the rays,      it  collects and transmits
  them in such directions as to mix and compound them in the
  spectrum.    Having made these remarks,     I    shall now endeavour
  to demonstrate how the colours in the prismatic spectrum are
                                                              produced.

produced.     Let a c (Plate I. fig. 9.) represent an aperture in the
window-shutter of a darkened room, through which no, a beam
of solar light, is transmitted ; and def, a prism placed behind
the aperture ac.      Now the ray ac is not attracted, but repelled
at the lower edge of the hole, towards the higher angle of the
prism d ; in like manner, the ray n a is refracted from the upper
edge of the aperture towards e, the refiingent angle of the prism,
and becomes incident at r".       It is evident that these two rays
are most refracted, and have the greatest polarity of all the rays
that compose the beam of light ; and therefore, as the angle of
refraction is in each nearly equal, both rays will be red. The in
termediate rays, incident upon de, will give a succession of co
lour according to their refraction or polarity ; the ray next to r'

   V.   On  Mr. George Stevenson's Pretensions to the          Discovery
              of the Safe-lamp. By A Correspondent.
  *
                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,      I
  Philosophical
               presume, when you         say in the last 'number of the
                   Magazine that you had conceived that Mr. George
   Stevenson's and Sir H. Davy's discoveries were made indepen
   dent of each other, that you must allude to Sir H. Davy's first
  lamp, with apertures in the bottom and top ; for I cannot sup
  pose that you can mean to establish an analogy between Sir H.
  Davy's wire-gauze safe-lamp, and any thing that Mr. G. Steven
  son has attempted.
      The only date of Mr. G. Stevenson's that can be considered as
  of any value, is that of Nov. 24, which is more than a fortnight
  after Sir H. Davy's first paper, and a week after his second paper
  had been read to the Royal Society, and twenty days after Sir
  H. Davy's discovery had been made known to the coal-trade,
  «id a month after it had been stated publicly to the Chemical
  Society of London,
                         " that if a lamp was supplied with air through
  small apertures only, below, explosive atmosphere would extin
  guish the flame," and
                              " that explosive atmospheres could not
  transmit the explosion through small tubes."
      Mr. G. Stevenson says, that he only profited in the practice
 of his lamp by the publications of scientific men ; and it is pretty
 evident, from the circumstances of dates, that he profited by what
 Sir H. Davy had published, though certainly the profit was very
 small.
     Mr. G. Stevenson is said to have embraced the idea of ad
 mitting hydrogen in small quantities, so as to consume it by com-
.bustion, and this in a close vessel.        Nothing can be more ab
 surd than the idea.       He attempted this with a tube and a slider
 as late as Nov. 17, long after Sir H. Davy, had shown and pub
 lished that capillary tubes, of a certain diameter and in certain
 numbers, were safe, and that a lamp supplied with air through
 small apertures in the bottom        was safe.
     Mr. G. Stevenson's friends at first were very anxious to show
 that his lamp was not stolen from Sir H. Davy's.             When, on
Nov. 3, Dr. Grey and the Rev. J. Hodgson spoke of Sir H. Davy's
                                                             discoveries,

discoveries, Mr. Lambert of Killingworth Colliery said that Mr*
Stevenson had made a safe-lamp : but it is evident from his own
confession, that this was the lamp with a single tube and a slider,
upon a principle which had been recommended by John Murray,
 esq.
     But, sir, what can be more vague than the certificate  ?  Trials
 are said to have been made,     but not how.      Hydrogen is talked
 of, explosive mixtures   of which will pass through tubes much too
 fine to supply air to a light, unless there were scores of them. *
     Mr. W. Brandling himself, the inventor of a safe-lamp, is the
 advocate for Mr. G. Stevenson. If Mr.W. Brandling knew, Nov.
,24th, that Mr. G. Stevenson had discovered a safe-lamp, why did
 he himself, in December, bring forward a lamp with a bellows and
 a tube at the bottom ?      And why did he not oppose the vote of
 thanks at which he was present, March 4th, when it was unani
 mously agreed that the united thanks and approbation of all pre
 sent should be given, for the great and important discovery of a
 safety-lamp for exploring mines charged with inflammable gas,
 and when they expressed their admiration of the talents and ac
 quirements which had achieved so momentous and important a
  discovery ?
     These, sir, are convincing facts. It is evident that even now
 neither Mr. W. Brandling nor Mr. G. Stevenson has any scien
 tific ideas on the subject of safe-lamps.    If they were so well in
 formed on the subject of flame, why did they not invent the wire-
 gauze safe-lamp, which Sir H. Davy himself did not discover till
 two months after his researches were begun, and which was at
 tained by the natural course of analogy, guided and confirmed by
  experiment and improved observation ?
      Because an ingenious and illiterate mechanic conceives that
  a light will hum from hydrogen without atmospherical air, and
  tries by a tube with a slider to verify this happy idea  therefore
  the inventor of a lamp composed of a tissue permeable to light
  and air, and impermeable to flame, (by which the fire-damp itself
  is consumed and made to give light, and which is daily giving
  security to hundreds of miners,) is entitled to no praise from the
  coal owners, but islo be calumniated by a man who is constantly
  profiting by his labours ! !
      If the wire-gauze safe-lamp had failed, who would have borne
  the blame ? Mr. G. Stevenson or Mr. W. Brandling ? or any of
  those persons so anxious at first to prove it of no value, and then
  so desirous of proving that it was no discovery ?      No ; the real
   inventor and the first victims would have been those enlightened
  gentlemen who trusted their lives to the resources of science,
  and made the first experiments in mines with it ; the Rev. John
  Hodgson, Mr. Buddie, Mr. Murray, Mr. Peele. Now that it is
                                                                     iu

VI. Remarks on Mr. Laplace's Table                              of the Depression     of
                 Mercury in the Tubes                  of   Barometers * .
                                    To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,-M R. Laplace speaks              this paper of having "discovered"
                                             in
and    " reduced to the fundamental principle of chemical affinities"
the theory of capillary action        at least there can be no doubt
                                            :
that his expressions are meant to be understood as relating en
tirely to his own investigations.            must confess that
                                                   I                 have       I
never thought his reasoning on the corpuscular powers of matter
sufficiently demonstrative      b;ut:        only at this moment that
                                                  it   is
I  have been able fully to satisfy myself,                      by
                                                        different train of
                                                                     a
arguments, with respect to the true foundation of the laws of
 capillary action.
    It  has been shown             by
                               an anonymous writer in Nicholson's
Journal for September 1807, that the superficial strata of co
hesive bodies, of     athickness less than the distance to which the                            
 cohesive force extends, must be less dense, and less coherent
 with the strata beneath them, than other parts of the body.
 Hence      may be inferred that a small portion of a liquid, in the
            it
 middle of such     astratum, will be less strongly pressed above and
 below than a similar portion of the internal part of the liquid,
 while the lateral pressure          undiminished, the particles in the
                                            is
 direction of the surface on each side exerting their full cohesive
 power.     This inequality must necessarily occasion a tendency
 in the stratum to acquire        greater thickness and a less length,
                                        a
 or in other words       contractile force, which will be the same in
                            a
 every part of the surface, and which will sufficiently explain all
 the phenomena of capillary action.
    Mr. Laplace has indeed denied the existence of such                ten       a
 sion but there
       :                some reason
                        is              to apprehend that he may have
 been since disposed to retract this opinion         as he most assuredly
                                                               ;
 would disclaim the preference which he has given to the slovenly
 method in which his table          computed,
                                         is          he should ever have

      University *.
 The       terms mountain and hill are words altogether relative in
  their signification, and are variously used in different parts of the
  World, according to the experience and conceptions of those who
  apply them.       In this country, elevations which are known only
  as hills, would in Great Britain assume the character of moun
 tains ; while on the other hand, our highest summits dwindle to
 an inferior size, when contrasted with the peaks and ridges of
 Switzerland, of Tibet, and Peru.            The face of the country in
 many parts      of the United States is uneven, rugged, and precipi
 tous ; its chains of highlands occasionally shoot up into emi
 nences, which are conspicuous at a great distance, and which
 are long and difficult of ascent.        But the highest of these eleva
 tions has no claim to be considered a mountain even of secon
 dary size, when compared with others which may be found in
 every quarter of the globe.        The surface of the lake of Lausa-
 nice, in France, is higher than any mountain in the United
 States; and the city ofHiobamba in Peru is built at an eleva
 tion more than twice as great f.
     It is not, however, for their great elevation alone, that moun
 tains become interesting to the naturalist and traveller.          Those
 of minor or secondary size are equally objects of curiosity, and
often furnish to the explorer more satisfactory results. The me
diocrity of their height renders them of course more accessible,
and more susceptible of investigation in all their parts.            Being
short of the limits of perpetual snow, they are covered with vege
tables, wherever the earth on them is sufficiently deep. The pro
spect from such mountains, as Baron Humboldt has observed, is
far more interesting than that from extreme elevations, where
the scenery of the adjacent country is lost and confounded by the
remoteness of its situation.

     In  the  United States, exclusive, or possibly inclusive, of Loui
siana,    the highest point or ridge of land is undoubtedly that of the
White mountains in New Hampshire.                From the earliest settle
ment of the country these mountains have attracted the notice of
the inhabitants, and of mariners along the coast, by the distance
at which they are visible, and the whiteness of their appearance
during three quarters of the year.           They were for a long time
the subject of fabulous representations ; the Indians had a super
stitious dread of them ; and travellers who occasionally ascended
their summits, returned with exaggerated re|iorts of the difficulty
and distance, as well as of the strange productions found on the
more elevated parts       of their surface.
     The earliest account of an ascent of the White mountains is
given in Gov. Winthrop's Journal, and appears to have taken
place in the year 1642. This account is somewhat curious, if not
otherwise, at least for its antiquity *.
    *  "  One Darby Field, an Irishman, Hying about Piscat, being accompa
 nied  with two Indians, went to the top of the White Hill.      He made his
journey in eighteen days. His relation at his return was, that it was about
 160 miles from Saco : that after forty miles travel, he did for the most part
 ascend ; and within twelve miles of the top was neither tree nor grass, but
 low savins, which they went upon the top of sometimes, but a continual
 ascent upon rocks, on a ridge betw een two valleys filled with snow, out of
 which came two branches of the Saco river, winch met at the foot of the
 hill, where was an Indian town of some 200 people.     Some of them accom
 panied him within eight miles of the top, but durst go no further, telling
 him that no Indian ever dared to go higher, and that he would die if he
 went. So they staid there till his return ; and hit two Indians took courage
 by his example, and went with him.      They went divers times through the
 thick clouds for a good space, and within four miles of the top they had
 no clouds, hut very cold.    By the way among the rocks there were two
 ponds ; one a blackish w ater, and the other reddish.     The top of ail was
 plain, about sixty feet square.    On the north side was such a precipice as
 they could scarcely discern the bottom. They had neither cloud nor wind
 on the top, and modciate heat. AH the country about him seemed a level,
 except here and there a hill rising above the rest and far beneath then*.
 He saw to the north a great water which he judged to be 100 miles broad,
 but could see no land beyond it. The sea by Saco seemed as if it had been
 within twenty miles.    He saw also a sea to the eastward, which he judged
  to be the Gulf of Canada:    he saw some great waters in parts to the west
 ward, which he judged to be the grtat lake Canada river comes out of.
 He found there much Muscovy glass : they could rive out pieces forty feet
 long, and seven or eight broad.     When he came back to the Indians, he
  found them drying themselves by the fire, for they had had a great tempest
  of wind and rain. About a month after, he went again with five or six of his
  company ; then they had some wind on the top, and some clouds above them
  which hid the sun. They brought some stones which they supposed had been
  diamonds, but they were most crystal."  Wintltrop't Journal, p, 247.
     The relation of Darby Field may be considered as in the main correct,
  after making reasonable deductions for the distance, the length of the Mus
  covy glass, and the quantity of water in view, which it may be suspected
  has not been seen by any visitor since his time.

34              Some Account  of the White Mountains
     Within the last forty years the White mountains have heeti
repeatedly ascended by different exploring parties, and several
accounts of their productions and phenomena have been pub
lished. The object of this paper is to detail such observations as,
were made by a party from Boston, who visited them in the be
ginning of July of the last summer.
     These mountains are situated in lat. about 44° 15' N, and
long. 71° 20' W. from Greenwich.        They are distant about 150
miles from Boston. Their Indian name, according to Dr. Belk
nap, was Agiocochook.
     Our approach to thern was made from the north-west, com
 mencing at the town of Lancaster, a village situated on the Con
 necticut river, 25 miles from their base. From this town a road
 has been cut, passing through a gap of the mountains to Port
 land, and constituting the principal outlet of the Coos country.
 This road takes the course of the Israel's river, a branch of the
 Connecticut, passing between the Pliny mountains on the left,
 and the Pondicherry mountain on the right. The village of Lan
 caster is situated in a vallev, surrounded in several directions by
 very elevated ridges of land. A number of the summits in sight
 of this place could not be estimated at less than 3,000 feet in
 height, judging from the experience we had acquired of several
 hills of known altitude on the road, and the accounts given by the
 inhabitants of the time necessary for their ascent and descent.
     The road from Lancaster passes through Jefferson (formerly
  Dartmouth), Bretton woods and Nash and Sawyer's, location, to
  the Notch of the mountains.      This road in its course runs over-
  the foot of the Pondicherry mountain.       It lies for most of the
  way through thick woods, but rarely enlivened with the appear
  ance of cultivation.   At Playstead's house, thirteen miles from
  their base, we had a fair view of the White Hills,       They pre
  sented the appearance of a continued waving range of summits,
  pf which it was difficult to select the highest.     At Rosebrooks,
    j
  4 miles from the Notch, the view of them was very distinct and
  satisfactory.   We could now clearly discern the character of the
  summits, five or six of which were entirely bald, and presented
   the appearance of a gray and ragged mass of stones towering
  above the woods, with which the sides and base were clothed.
   In several places we observed a broad continued stripe descend-,
  ing the mountain, and having the appearance of a regular road
   cut through the trees and rocks, from near the base to the sum
  mit of tl^e mountain.     On examining these with a telescope,
  they were found to be channels of streams ; and in several, the
  water could be seen dashing down the rocks.
      Between Rosebrooks and the Notch is a plain, or rather a
  swamp, the waters of which pass off in different directions, partly

                         of New Hampshire.                           35
 to the Ammunoosuck, a branch of the Connecticut, and partly
 by an opposite course to the Sacp. After crossing several brooks
running towards the former, we came to another stream, the
 water of which was 90 sluggish that it required some time to
 become satisfied that it was actually flowing in the opposite di
 rection.   This stream has its origin in a pond of one or two
 acres, situated near the road, and having no other inlet or out
 let.   This pond appears to be the principal source of the Saco
 river.
    The waters of this stream being collected from several sources
 proceed directly toward the side of the mountain.         At the point
where to all appearance they must be intercepted in theircour.se,
there occurs one of the most extraordinary features of the place,
well known by the name of the Notch.             The whole mountain,
which otherwise forms a continued range, is here cloven down
quite to its base, affording a free opening to the waters of the
Saco, which pass off with a gradual descent toward the sea.
This gap is so narrow that space has with difficulty been ob
tained for the road, which follows the course of the Saco through
the Notch eastward.       In one place the river disappears, i being
lost in the caves and crevices of the rocks, and under the shelves
of the adjoining precipice, at length reappearing at the distance
of some rods below. The Notch gradually widens into a long
narrow valley, in the lower part of which is situated the town of
Bartlett.
    There is no part of the mountain more calculated to excite
interest and wonder than the scenery of this natural gap.          The
crags and precipices on both sides rise at an angle of great
steepness, forming a support or basement for the lofty and irre
gular ridges above.     One of the most picturesque objects in our
view was a cliff presenting a perpendicular face of great height,
and crowned at its inaccessible summit with a profusion of
flowering shrubs*.      For many miles below the commencement
of the Notch the eye meets on both sides a succession of steep
and precipitous mountains, rising to the height of some thou
sands of feet, and utterly inaccessible from the valley below.
The sides of these mountains consist in some parts of bald rock,
streaked or variegated by the trickling of water, in others they
are covered with trees and shrubs.            The occasional torrents
formed by the freshets in the spring have in many places swept
away the stones and trees from their course, for a great distance,
and left the vestiges of their way in a wide path or gully over
naked rocks.

36              Some Account      of the White Mountains
     In some instances the fire had run over the sides of the moun
 tain, destroying the vegetation and leaving the dead trunks of
 the trees standing like stubble in a field, and presenting a sin
 gular appearance of desolation for some miles in extent.              Several
 brooks,    the  tributaries   of the   Saco, fall down the abrupt decli
 vities, forming a succession of beautiful cascades in sight of the
 road.    We were told that the wind sweeps through the Notch
 at times with great violence.              The lightning is said to strike
 frequently in the mountains from the clouds about their sides,
 and the sound of the thunder in this place is represented as un
 usually loud and severe.         The report of a musket discharged in
 the Notch     was   followed by a long echo, reverberated for some
 time from both sides of the mountain.
     The White Hills have been ascended by various routes, from
 the irdifferent sides. The course which is usually considered as
 attended with the least difficulties, is that which commences at
 the plain of Pigwacket, at present the town of Conway, and fol
 lows the course of Ellis river, a northern branch of the Saco,
 having its origin high in the mountain.
    The place of leaving the road, to follow the t rack of this stream,
 is in the town of Adams, about twenty miles from the summit of
 the highest part of the mountain.                Of this distance seven or
 eight   miles   may  be   rode   over   on   horseback,  the rest must be
 performed     on  foot.    After  leaving    the borders of cultivation, our
 course lay through thick woods,               on a level or  with a gentle
 ascent, not much encumbered with an under growth of bushes,
for six miles.       The walking was tolerably good, except the cir
 cumstance of being obliged once or twice to ford the streams.
 Our encampment for the night was made at the mouth of New
 river, a principal branch of the Ellis.          This river takes its name
 from the recency of its origin, which happened in October 1775.
At this time, during a great flood that took place in consequence
 of heavy rains, a large body of waters, which had formerly de
scended by other channels, found their way over the eastern brink
of the mountains, and fell down toward the Ellis, carrying the
rocks and trees before them in their course, and inundating the
adjacent country.         By this freshet the banks of the Saco were
overflowed, cattle were drowned, and fields of corn were swept
away and destroyed.           Since that period, the New river has re
mained a constant stream, and at the place where it descends
the last precipice, forms a splendid cascade of 100 feet in height.
    From this encampment, which was seven miles from the top
of the mountain, we proceeded the next day (July 2) two or
three miles by the side of Ellis river, on a gradual ascent, occa
sionally encumbered by the trunks of fallen trees. We now left
                                      ,   -                               the

leading directly towards the principal summit.        After climbing
by the side of this stream for a considerable distance, the trees
of the forest around us began to diminish in height, and we found
                                                                       '
ourselves at the second zone or region of the mountain.         This
region is entirely covered with a thick low growth of evergreens,
principally the black spruce and silver fir, which rise to about
the height of a man's head, and put o;;t numerous, strong, ho*
rizontal branches, which are closely interwoven with each other,
and surround the mountain with a formidable hedge, a quarter
of a mile in thickness. This zone of evergreens has always con
stituted one of the most serious difficulties in the ascent of the
White Hills. The passage through them is now much facilitated
by a path cut by the direction of Colonel Gibbs, who ascended
the mountain some years since.
   On emerging from this thicket, the barometer stood at 25,93,
giving our elevation above the sea at 4,443 feet. We were now
above all woods, and at the foot of what is called the bald part
of the mountain.      It rose before us with a steepness surpassing
that of any ground we had passed, and presented to view a huge,
dreary, irregular pile of dark naked rocks.
    We crossed a plain or gentle slope, of a quarter of a mile, and
began to climb upon the side. There was here a continued and
laborious ascent of half a mile, which must be performed by cau
tiously stepping from one rock to another, as they present them
selves like irregular stairs, winding on the broken surface of the
mountain.      In the interstices of these rocks were occasional
patches of dwarfish fir and spruce, and beautiful tufts of small
alpine shrubs, then in full flower.
    Having surmounted this height, we found ourselves on a se
cond plain. This, like the first, was covered with withered grass
and a few tufts- of flowers.   Its continuity is interrupted by se
veral declivities, one of which we descended to our left, to reach
a brook that crosses it here from the rocks above.         There re
mained now to be ascended only the principal peak ; the one
designated in Winthrop's Journal by the name of the sugar-loaf,
and in Belknap's New Hampshire by the name of Mount Wash
ington.    This we accomplished in half an hour, by climbing
the ridge to tire north of  it,   and walking on this ridge to the
summit.
  If  the traveller could be transported at once to the top of this
mountain, from the country below, he would no doubt be asto
nished and delighted at the magnitude of his elevation, at the
extent and variety of the surrounding scenery, and above all,     by
the huge and desolate pile of rocks, extending to great distance

in    every direction     beneath him, and appearing to insulate hirfl
from the rest of the world.               But the length and fatigue of the
 approach, the time occupied in the ascent, the gradual manner
 in which the prospect has been unfolding itself, are circumstances
 which leave less novelty to be enjoyed at the summit, than at
 first view of the subject would be expected.
      The day of our visit was uncommonlv fine ; yet the atmosphere
was hazy, and our view of remote objects was very indistinct.
 The Moosehillock, one of the highest mountains of New Hamp
shire, situated in Coventry, near the Connecticut, was visible on
 the south. The Kyarsarge, Double-headed Mountains, and se
 veral others, were in full view at the east. The country around,
 in almost every direction, is uneven and mountainous.                   Its ap
 pearance is described by Josselyn, in his            "  Rarities of   New    En
 gland," published in 1672, who says that the country beyond
 tha mountains to the northward " is daunting terrible, being full
of rocky hills, as thick as mole-hills in a meadow, and clothed
 with infinite thick woods *."
      Our anticipations were not realised, in regard to several ph»-
 nomena we had been taught to expect at the summit. The state
 of the air was mild and temperate ; so that the over coats which
 we carried up in expectation of extreme cold, were left at the
 foot of the last ascent. The thermometer stood at 57 Fahr. on
 the summit at twelve o'clock, and on the same day at Conway,
 twenty-five miles distant on the plain below, it was at 80. The
 snow lay in patches of an acre in extent upon the sides, but ap
 peared to be rapidly dissolving.            We were not conscious of any
 material alteration in the density of the atmosphere, as neither
 sound nor respiration was perceptibly impeded.                    Instead of an
 absence from these barren regions, of animal and vegetable life,
 we found a multitude of insects buzzing around the highest rocks,
 every -stone was covered with lichens, and some plants were in
 flower in the crevices within a few feet of the summit.
      The ascent from our encampment at the mouth of New river,
 including stops, had employed us six hours and a half. The
  descent from the summit to the same place occupied about fiv«

                  Height of the White Mountains.
    The great distance at which these mountains are visible, and
the apparent length of their ascent, have led to estimates of their
height considerably exceeding the probable truth.               The Rev.
Dr. Cutler, who twice visited them, and took barometrical ob
servations, computes the height in round numbers at 10,000
feet above the level of the sea.          Dr. Belknap, in his History of
New Hampshire, is persuaded that this computation is too mo
derate, and that subsequent calculations will make the height
 even greater.     Mr. Bowditch has published in the Transactions
of the American Academy a logarithmic calculation, founded
on the barometer as observed by Dr. Cutler and Professor Peck,
in 1804, which gives them an elevation of 7,055.
    Capt. Partridge, an engineer in the United States' service,
visited the mountains some years since, and took barometrical
observations on several of the principal peaks. His observations,
now in possession of Professor Farrar at the university, give to
the highest summit an elevation of only 6,103 feet.
    A mountain barometer, of Englefield's construction, carried
 bv Mr. Gray of our party, stood on the summit at noon at 24,23;
 the accompanying thermometer being at 57.               At the same day,
 at Cambridge,     the barometer        stood  at 29,95, and the thermo
 meter at 76.     This difference of the barometer, after making
 the necessary corrections for temperature, and variation in the
 surface of the cistern, would give, according to Sir H.C. Engle
 field's formula, a difference of 6,230 feet in the altitude of the
 two places.    A logarithmic calculation was made, from the same
 data, by Professor Farrar, which resulted in a difference of 6,194
 feet.    This number being added to thirty-one feet, the height
 of Cambridge above tiie sea, will give 6,225 feet, which may be
 assumed as the probable height of the White Hills above the
  waters of the ocean.

40             Some  Account   of the White Mountains
computation is founded, it may be observed, that the barometer
employed was of the most approved and modern construction,
being guarded against accidents with an express view to its use
in expeditions of this sort ; that it went and returned without
injury; and at the end of the journey agreed with other instru
ments at the university, precisely as it had done before its re*
moval.
     In confirmation of the present estimate, it may also be ob
served, that a geometrical admeasurement, taken by Dr. Shat-
 tuck and others from the plain in front of Rosebrooks house,
gave to the summit an elevation of 4,620 feet above that place.
 This being added to 1,648, the barometrical height of Rose-
 brooks above the sea, will give a total of 6,268 feet, differing
 only forty-three feet from our estimate.
     W. Maclure, Esq. author of the geological map of the United
 States, informs me, that from two geometrical admeasurements
 made some years since on the eastern and western sides of the;
 mountain, he arrived at results nearly similar.
                               Minerals.
     The White Mountains when viewed from the westward, present
 a long ridge bounded by an undulating or serpentine line.        On
 a near view, the outline is found to be notched and ragged, but
 wholly destitute of sharp cliffs and needles, or sudden perpendi
 cular eminences.     When the mountain is ascended, its upper
 most or bald portion, 1,800 feet in height, is found to consist
  wholly of a loose, irregular, disconnected heap of rocks, of all
  shapes and dimensions, from one to thirty feet in diameter, lying
  confusedly one above another, but all resting firmly in their
  places, having found situations where they can resist the torrents,
  that roll over them, in descending the sides of the mountain at
  certain seasons of the year.     These rocks are of gneiss and mi
  caceous schistus, or rather of an intermediate substance between
  the two, approaching sometimes the one and sometimes the other.
  The mica is abundant and brilliant, but its stratification is un
  even and irregular, and often interrupted by thin strata of
  quartz.     Owing to the irregular position of the rocks, their
  strata are found resting in every possible direction.   Large veins
  of quartz very frequently traverse them, and specimens of pure
   mica may occasionally be obtained, the plates of which are se
  veral inches in diameter.    There is nothing in the colour of the
   rocks which can in any way account for the white appearance of
  the mountains, since they are uniformly incrusted with dark-gray
  lichens, which give them an almost blackish appearance. Their
   distant white appearance can only be accounted for by the pre
  sence of snow, which covers the summits for two-thirds or more
                                                                   of

bt the year; In summer, their remote appearance is blue, like
that of other distant objects.
    In the middle and lower parts of the mountain, the character
of micaceous slate, which in the course we took appeared to be
the predominant constituent of the mountain, is more perfectly
formed.     The strata are remarkably smooth and even, and their
fissure presents the most brilliant silvery lustre.      The bed of the
cascade at New River was principally of this material, inter
sected by thick veins of quartz, in which were contained large
crystals of schorl.     The pebbles in the streams were chiefly of
micaceous slate, and occasionally of gneiss, of granite, and of
JMire white quartz.      We also met with hornblende containing
traces of carbonate of lime.
    The object of most of our party being botanical, and our course
 generally rapid, the observations and collections we were able
 to make in mineralogy were necessarily limited.          George Gibbsj
'Esq. who has twice ascended the mountain             on  different  sides,
 with a view to the examination of its geology, has favoured me
 with the following remarks made by him at the time.  In some
  places where the geology of the mountain was exposed, he found
 the lower strata of greenstone and greenstone slate, with some
 granite.    Higher up, granite and gneiss prevailed.         The green
 stone is fine-grained, containing pyrites.        The  greenstone slate
 contains actinote.     The granite contains emerald, tourmaline,
 white quartz and feldspar, white and reddish mica, and garnets
 of different sizes.     The granite is distinctly stratified.         Thp
 strata of these rocks are from six inches to many feet in thick
 ness, the granite being thickest, generally two or three feet.
 The dip of the strata is small and from the mountain.                 The
 rock, on the summit and for some hundred feet        below,   was  gneiss,
 afterwards granite prevailed.        Near the Notch Col. Gibbs ob
 served rocks of coarse reddish jasper and porphyry, and obtained
 from the inhabitants specimens of fluor spar and magnetic iron
  ore.
                                  Plants.
     The vegetation of the White Hills has been divided with pro
  priety into three zones.     1 . That of the common forest trees ;
  2. that of dwarf evergreens ; and, 3. that of alpine plants.
     The woods which extend from the base up the sides to the
  height of about 4,000 feet from the sea, consist of the rock-
                                                                        the
  maple {Jeer sacchurinum), which is the most abundant tree,
  red maple {Acer ruhrum),        the  silver fir {Pinus  balsamea),    the
  hemlock {Pinus Canadensis), the       black   and white  spruce   {Pinut
         &   alba), the white  pine           Strobus),  the beech ( Fa-
  nigra                               {Pinus
 gus ferrughtea),      the black, yellow, and white birch {Betula

     42           Some Account    of the While Mountains
     lento, lulea & papyracea) . The undergrowth was composed
    principally of the Viburnum lanlanoides, the Acer montanum
     and striatum, and Sorbus Americana.       Under our feet was the
     Oxaiis Acelawllu beyond every other species of plant, Dracena
.*   horealis, Corvut Canadensis, Gaultheria hispidula, &c.
        Where the common      forest trees terminate,  the second zone
    of the mountain immediately commences, the line      betweeen them
    being very distinctly drawn.     This region consists of a belt of
    the black spruce and silver fir, rising to the height of seven or
    eight feet, and putting out long, firm, horizontal, or depending
    branches, so that each tree covers a considerable extent of ground.
    This mode of growth may be ascribed to two causes: 1. The
    great length of time that the snow rests upon them, weighing
    down their branches, and confining them in an horizontal di
    rection. 2. The extreme cold which probably prevails here in
    winter, and which is destructive to ail vegetation that is not
    secured by being buried under the snow.      Upon the ground un
    der these evergreen trees there were but few other vegetables.
    The only plants which I recollect in flower were the Houstonia
    ccerulea uncommonly large, and Cornus Canadensis.
        Above the zone of firs, which terminates as abruptly as it be
    gan, is a third or bald region wholly destitute of any growth of
    wood.     The predominance of rocks on this portion leaves but
    a scanty surface covered with soil capable of giving root to ve
    getation ; yet to the botanist this is by far the most interesting
   part of the mountain.       Many of the plants of this region are
    rare, and not to be found in the region below.        They are for
   the most part natives of cold climates and situations, such as are
   found in high latitudes or at great elevations.        Among them
   are natives of Siberia, of Lapland, of Greenland and Labrador.
   Vegetables of this race, usually known by the name of Alpine
   plants, have always been found difficult of cultivation. They
   are impatient of drought, and of both the extremes of heat and
   cold.     During the severity of the winter, in their native situa
   tions they are preserved from injury by the great depth of snow
   under which they are covered, which secures them from the in
   clemency of the air, while they partake the temperature of the
   earth below them.      When the snow leaves them, which fre7
   ouently does not happen till the middle of summer, they instantly
   s4ioot up with a vigour proportionate to the length of time they
   have been dormant ; rapidly unfold their flowers, and mature
   their fruits; and having run through the whole course of their
   vegetation in a few weeks, are again ready to be entombed for
   the rest of the year under their accustomed covering of snow.
   These plants, notwithstanding the high and barren elevations
   at which they frequently grow, do not suffer for want of moisture,
                                                                 being

and by the trickling of water over their roots from the eminences
above.
   The following list contains most of the plants, which we found
on the uppermost or bald portion of the mountain.                              For a con
siderable increase of the collection, I am indebted to my friend
Mr. F. Boott, whose botanical zeal induced him to undertake a

    The vegetation in spots extended quite to \he top of the
mountain.        Diapensia Lapponica and Lycopodium lucidulum,
the former in full flower, were growing within six feet of the
summit.        All the rocks were incrusted with lichens, among
which    L. velleus is the one which predominates, and contributes
essentially to the dark gray appearance of the mountain.
    In the foregoing list of vegetables, it will be seen that a con
siderable number of species are natives of Europe as well as of
this country.       A question of some interest has arisen  whether
any plants are originally common to both continents f, and
whether those species which approach each other so nearly in
their external characters, as to be known at present by the same
names, are in reality the same species. The analogy of the animal
kingdom seems to favour the negative of this question.                             Baron
Humboldt has asserted, upon the highest authorities, that no
quadruped or terrestrial bird, attd even no reptile or insect, has
been found common to the equinoctial regions of the old and
new world.        In like manner he affirms that the phanerogamous
plants, which have been recognised as natives of the tropical
regions of both continents, are extremely few.                      In the temperate
zones,    the   number      of American         plants     which       wear European
names is continually diminishing in books.                         The separation of

     Specimens of the plants were sent to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks ;
and Mr. Boott (we understand) has pointed out the following corrections,
the result of a hasty examination of the plants which he made with Mr.
Brown.      Lycopodium lucididum is H. Sclago (Smith's Flora Srilamiica). 
Holcus monticola is H. ulpinus (Wald. Flora Lapponica.)  Scirpus brac

them has in some instances been carried further than a strict
adherence to the present grounds of botanical distinction will
justify.       Yet there still remain species wholly agreeing in their
botanical characters, but sufficiently differing in their qualities,
places of growth, times of flowering, &c. to render it not im
probable that they are distinct.              A species of JEthusa grows
 about Boston, which externally bears the strictest comparison
 with JEthusa Cynaprum of Europe.                   It is however altogether
 destitute of the nauseous or garlic taste for which that plant is
 noted. Mem/anthcs trifoliata in New-England flowers a month
 earlier than in Great Britain, though our seasons are perhaps
 always more backward.              Botanists have not yet distinguished
 the chesnut-tree of this country from that of Europe, although
 its wood is weak and brittle, aud never used, as in Europe, for
 hoops and other purposes where strength and tenacity are re
 quired.        On grounds like the foregoing a great number of ve
 getables which have not emigrated to us since the discovery of
 America, und which are not found far to the north of us, may be
 suspected of being really distinct in nature from those which nearly
  resemble them in Europe, and are known by the same names*.
      But as we approach toward the north, and arrive in high lati
 tudes, the probability of finding plants identically the same is
 greatly increased.         About the arctic circle, the two continents
 approach each other so nearly, and are so connected by ice
 during part of the year, that they may, as far as botany is con
 cerned, be considered the same country.                The same plants may
 be equally disseminated on both, and these may extend as far
 toward the south as the general coldness of the climate suited to
  their constitution continues.           Beyond this they may for some
  distance be found in alpine situations on the tops of the highest
     * Still we should strictly beware of hastily changing names, and establish
  ing new species on slight or doubtful distinctions.        Botany, at present,
  knows no other mode of distinguishing plants, than that by their external
   forms, and to this, in the present state of the science, we must rigidly ad-,
  here.      If an American plant cannot readily be distinguished from an
  European, by a clear specific character, no harm can ensue, and much con
  fusion may he avoided, by suffering it to remain as a variety, under that
   same specific name.      A real for the discovery and establishment of new
   speaies, however laudable in its general object, has been productive of
   much mischief to the botany of this country.       We have had many specific
   names founded in varieties, and many accompanied with hasty and imper
   fect descriptions, which leave it doubtful whether they refer to species or
   varieties. Different botanists, without communication or intercourse with
   each other, have described the same plants under different names, and
    different plants under the same names, in various parts of the country.
   There is at present 410 greater obstacle to the progress of botany here,
   than the load of uncertain synonyms, doubtful species, and superfluous
    names, with which many of our best books are encumbered.
                                                                    mountain}.

 mountains.      There are also plants of such versatility of consti
 tution, that they bear all the varieties of climate from Hudson's.
 Bay to Virginia and Carolina. Such plants may well be common
 to the two continents.
                                    Animals.
    The unsettled state of the country for some distance around
 these mountains, the many recesses and solitudes which they
possess, that are rarely visited by man, has rendered them still
 a resort for many of the original animals of the continent, whose
 species have nearly disappeared from the more inhabited parts.
The moose ( Census alces ?) still resides here ; and we were told
 that upon the Pliny mountains, about twenty miles to the N. W.
some of these animals are killed in the course of every winter.
The bear (Ursus Americanus) inhabits the woods about the base
and sides of the mountain, where he is not unfrequently met
with*. The wolves {Canis Lupus) being gregarious, move in
troops, and are said to visit this part of the country once in three
or four years. Several of them were killed last winter in Eaton,
 a town adjoining the mountains. The wolverene [Ursus luscus) y
 raccoon {Ursus Lolor), porcupine (Hystrix dorsatu) and sable,
the two latter in considerable numbers, are found in various parts,
of the forests. The wild cat ( Felis montana ?) is occasionally
killed here. The catamount (Felis concolor s. Couguar) is at
the present day seldom heard of.
    Of birds we saw but few. Most of our migratory land birds.,
choosing to share with man the fruits of his cultivation, are more
frequently found about the abodes of civilization than in the so
litude of the forest, In Bretton woods several woodpeckers were
sjhot by our party, all of them very beautiful species ; and among
the rest Picus tridactylus, remarkably distinguished from the
rest of his family by the number of his toes. The partridge (Te-
trao TJmbellus) we frequently scared. This bird, as well as.
a species of plover or of Tringa, has been seen in the upper or
bald part of the mountain.
    We were told by the people in Bartlett and Conway, that the
rattlesnake (Crolahts horridus) infests the rocks and sides of the
hills in great numbers, and that twenty of these reptiles had
been killed in a day.          They even approach dwelling-houses, at
the doors of which they have been killed.            The inhabitants re
gard   them   with    little  apprehension,  since they are represented
as slow and clumsy in their motions, and as always giving notice
on being approached, by a loud and long-continued rattle, re-,
sembling very much the singing of a locust.             We saw none of

 VIII.      Experiments on various refractory Substances by means
      of the Oxi-hydrogen Blow-pipe. By J. Murray, Esq*
                             To   Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,      I feel    happy in being able to resume the detail of
 experiments      made   with Newman's blow-pipe, an instrument of
  no   mean   importance to the chemist and mineralogist.  The ap
  plication of an explosive mixture of the gaseous constituents of
  water, in a condensed form, for the obtainment of an exalted tem-        i
  perature, marks an extraordinary period in the anna'* of science.
  The chain of brilliant results which has characterized its appli
  cation by Dr. Clarke* gives to the machine a most imposing
  and interesting form.        The scientific chemist will appreciate its
  value, and duly acknowledge his thanks to Dr. Clarke, who
  has first pointed out its control over the most refractory con
  stituents of the globe, in that masterly manner of which his re
   sults are evidence.      Not satisfied with the exhibition of these
   beautiful phenomena, he has succeeded in rendering the instru
   ment peifectly secure against explosion.          The substitution of
   a little oil instead of water, in the cell of the reservoir, is all the
   requirement.     Dr. Clarke has been good enough to communicate:
   this important fact to me ; and I am glad that the event of my
   experiments since that period, has fully justified the conclusion.
    Much praise is also due to Mr. Newman of Lisle-street, for the
   ingenuity he has displayed in its structure, and bis unwearied
    efforts to render it safe.   I may here state that Geo. Rennie, esq.
   joined    me  in the  experiments which 1 shall now describe; and
    though a second explosion has occurred in the course of our ma
    nipulations, it has served but to redouble our exertions, and
    impart a new impujse, and excite a livelier interest.

 IX.    On the ancient Names         for Colour, particularly as applied
    to the   Colour  of the   Light of Stars. By T. Forster, Esq.
                                To  Mr.   Tilloch.
  Sir,  Having lately met with several treatises on the mu
  tations of colour    in the light of the fixed stars, in which         this
  fact has  been attempted to be proved by citations from the works
  of the ancient poets and others, who have described the colour
  of particular stars now evidently not answering the same de
  scription; and having myself made some observations on the
  colour of stars, 1 was led to refer back to the ancient au-
      Vol. 49. No. 225. Jan. 1817.                        D         thorities

  50            On the ancient Names          for   Colour, particularly
 thorities themselves, and was consequently induced thereby to
 enter more at large into the real import of the names used bv
 the Roman and Greek writers for colours.                   And I am convinced
 that no accurate argument can be drawn from the Classical writers
 respecting the real colours of stars, or any other natural bodies,
 from the very vague and indefinite meaning of the names of co
 lours themselves, and also from the excessive latitude given by
 poetic writers to the signification of words. I would, however,
 make an exception of such cases as those wherein two particular
 colours are contrasted to each other in the same passage.
     To apply this observation to our subject : Though the observa
 tions of TychoBrahe, and other more modern astronomers, rela
 tive to the light of the stars, are valuable, being written at a time
 when, philosophical Latin having become the medium of com
 municating science, terms were used in a more definite sense ;
 yet I should suspect the accuracy of any arguments drawn from
 the early Greek and Roman poets, in which the colour of the
 starlight is alluded to ; making an exception only of such pas
 sages as contrasted strikingly opposite colours.
    1 shall offer a few examples to illustrate               this position ; and
 conclude with referring to the etymological^ import of many
 words designating colours.
 I. Passages wherein two or more colours are contrasted and
    distinguished,          but which stilt do not accurately define the pre
     cise   tint.
     The ancients have in            some instances used words for colour in
 a sense hardly           to he mistaken, by employing them to contrast
 two phenomena whose difference of colour is marked and well
 known everywhere, and which we have no reason to think
 changes from time to time.                 Instances are to be met with, in
 which the colours produced by refraction of the light of the
 heavenly bodies constitute examples.
    Ovid, in Metamorph. xv. 192, uses rubere, to redden, for the
 red colour of the sun near the horizon, produced by denser re
 fraction ; and contrasts it with the term candidus, applied to the
 sun in his greatest altitude ; whereas from a lesser degree of re
 fraction it approaches nearer to white. Thus,
            "  Ipse Dei clypeiis, territ cum tollitur inla,
              Mane rubet : terrSque rulivt, cum conditur ima,
              Candidus in snmmo est. Melior nattira qufkl illic
          .   ittlieris est, terncque procnl couta^ia vitat."
    Virgil, in Georg. i. 431, among the signs of wind, evidently
,marks the red colour of the moon :
              " At,   si virgitieum suffuderit ore ruborem,        -  .
                                                                        , ,
                 Ventus erit: vento semper rubet aurea Phoebe."
                                                                             He

              as applied to the Colour             of the Light of Stars.           51
     He shortly afterwards contrasts this red colour with pura, ct
 white, that is free from coloration, when, before fine weather,
 the moon,
            "  Pura, neque obtusis percoelum cornibus ibit."
    Horace has the same expression for the pure light                   of the moon,
 in Carm. ii. v. 20.
                       " Ut   pura nocturno renidet
                             Luna mari."
     Aratus also, in Dios. 53, evidently contrasts the red with the
 white colour, in the following lines on the presages of weather :

     Again, speaking of the more certain prognostic of rain in pro
portion as the circles called halos are more reddened,  a fact
 well known to modern meteorologists,  he says :

     Theophraatus, in Sign. Temp, contrasts the blackish colour of
the sun and moon, by the interposition of an obscure cloud, as
 a sign of rain, with the red colour which is a forerunner of wind.

 II.    Passages wherein a most extended and undcfinable signifi
       cation is given to the names of colours by the ancients.
     A proof of the very indefinite import of names for colours among
the ancients may be drawn, 1st, from their incongruity with the
known colours of the substances to which they are applied, if
taken in the strict sense : and 2dly» from examples in which the
same term is applied to bodies of a known difference of colour.
A few examples will suffice, which happen to be in my mind, and
will lead to a more extensive inquiry.
     Pcirpureus is applied,
     1 . To the rose, in which                it approaches the nearest to our
         modern    idea of purple;-^ thus in Virgil, c. 14.
                                 "  Rosa purpurea."
    *  If the reader wishes to pursue, this subject further,        I  have put a lona;
list of references in the notes to a Jate edition of the Dioseineia of Aratus,
                                             , '    -           '

52         On the ancient Names for Colour, particularly
   2.   To the colour of the violet ; as in Virg. Georg. iii.
                       " Viols sublucet purpura nigrse."
   3. To the narcissus,            as in    Virg. Eel. v. 38.
                   " Pro   molli viola, pro purpureo narcisso."
   4.   To the colour of the sea, as in              Virg. Georg. iv. 3/3,
       speaking of the Po, or Eridanus :
                        ' quo non per pinguia culta
               In  mare purpureum violentior influit amnis."
   5.   To the colour which          is given to the green waves of the sea
       (virides, undce) by       the   rough wind; as
               " Spiritus Eurorum      virides quum purpurat    undas."
In which        case   purpurat may mean, 1st, that it gives the sea
that purple colour sometimes occurring in storms ; or, 2dly, that
it causes the brilliant white or silver colour of the frothy spumes
of the rough waves in the sun : the last sense is most likely, as
purple is applied.
   6. To the brilliancy of the sun and other luminous bodies in
       general;      as
               "  Purpureas inter soles, et Candida Luna;
                  Sydera."
       The word wogtpvgeo;          has    in Greek a signification almost as
           unlimited.
   7.    To flowers in general,         as if it signified only brilliancy, from
           the gaudy contrast of flowers to their leaves.
 Candidus is applied,
    1. -To things fair or beautiful in the most general acceptation,
           as to the constellation Taurus.
                 " Candidus auratis aperit cum cornibus annum,
                  Taurus," &c.         Virg. Georg.
    2.   To the sun whep high, either from its brightness or white
        ness   in comparison with his disk in            a horizontal position,
                     "   Candidus in summo est," &c.         Ovid.
        Also, Solis candor frequently for the sun's bright light.
    The word comes from candeo, to shine, and has no limited
 meaning, as to colour, whatever.
    The word Cceruleus seems to have been derived from xeiXoc.
        It  is applied,
    1.   To the snake, perhaps from the blue colour of                  some par
        ticular snake.
    2.   To the      sea  Caerula      verrunt (remigio).        See also many
        passages      wherein the ocean seems to be called cceruleus,
        vjridis,    and purpureus,           almost indifferently,      as it ac
                                                                           corded

            as applied to the       Colour     of the Light of Stars.     53
       accorded with versification in poetry, or avoided tautology.
       I    may add, that Alius is the most restricted in its signifi
       cation.      Niger as extended as any. Argenteus and Au
       reus are again more limited in their meaning, as are in ge
       neral the colours taken from metals.
 Flavus     is put,
    1. For red hair, as
                                flava Mineiva, &c.
    2. For many flowers of different colours, for crimson, &c. And
       numerous other substances might be added, were it not for
       swelling this paper.
 Ruber is applied variously:
    1. To the hyacinth*, as Virg. Echg.
                          "  Suave rubens hyncinthus."
    2.  To the red colour of the heavenly bodies before wind,             as
       above quoted :
                         "  Vento nthcl  a urea  Phuebe," &c.
   3.   To the moon itself, .although her colour is so often con
       trasted with red, and called pallida, alba, Candida, &e. ;
       consequently cannot ever be depended on as representing
       the red colour of any fixed star, called by the ancients
       rubra.
    Festus Avienus in the          Ant hoi. Vet. Lai. says,
                    "          reparation Cynthia format
                  .   Lucis honorc jubar, curvatis cornibus   arcus
                      Quod de fratre rubet.''
    There are    so many other instances where rubere is put for
nitere, splendescere, &c. that I am convinced no argument can
be drawn from its application to the light of stars by ancient
poets.     An ingenious paper on this subject, however, has been
inserted in the Philosophical Transactions by Mr. Barker ; but
from an examination of the subject among the ancient writers,
too long to be inserted in full here, I am induced to rely much
less than he does on the particular signification of the ancient
 terms for colour.
   Similar observations apply to 7rop$vpio;, t-ctvUo;, \svxo;, cce~
ruleus, fulvus, luleus, alius, niger, &c. ; and to the words
for colours in other languages.                 In short, in the progress of
science,   while      literature     was   emerging from the dark ages,
the names of colours, like other words, were derived from
reference to particular coloured bodies: but as there were
   * It is not
               quite certain what flowers the Hyacinth and Narcissus of the
ancients were. Our present narcissus has no properties from which it
could be derived, as it evidently is from

not names enough to express all the tints of nature, their signi
fication was widely extended, particularly by the license of the
ancient poets ; and it is only by modern philosophers, as science
advanced, that they have become more determined in their signi
fication.
     In a former paper in the Philosophical Magazine* I have given
a series of the etymological derivations of the names for colours in
our language, where by reference to ohl books, and by the faci
lity of etymology, in English, we can trace them to their primi
tive meaning in the mother tongue ; and 1 have proposed a
new Nomenclature for colours, which shall express the proportion
of primitive colours which compose the beautiful and extensively
varied tints by which the surface of the globe is everywhere or
namented.          And I have added these observations, on the applica
tion of the names for colour to the illustration of change of colours
of the fixed stars, with a view that those who have more classical

    Yellow.  This      word is derived from the Anglo-Saxon -verb geselgan,
accendere (to inflame,)    and signifies the colour of flame.    In like manner
the Latin Jiammeus, as well as Jiavus, come from Qj-iyfix, flame, from
    K.ED.  The etymology of the word seems doubtful.         HorneTooke has
omitted it in his etymological account of colours in the Diversions of
Purley.     I  suspect, however, it may have some connection with the word
ray, and expresses the colour of the sun's rays
    Blue.  This word seems to come from blopan, Jlorere (to blow as a
flower does), and signifies the colour of flowers;  certainly the most inde
finite of all our names for colours, like the Greek l*,t'i, from i£ and atlas,,
i. e. color e floribus.
    Green is derived from the Anglo-Saxon verb gpenruan, vitescere.           In
like manner the Latin virere gave the adjective viridis.
    Purple is commonly used in modern times for the compound of red
 and blue, is derived from the Latin purpureas, and signifies only flume co
loured; from *ut,fire.
    Brown is a corruption of the past participle of the Anglo-Saxon verb
 bpennan, vrere (to burn), and signifies the colour of burnt substances ;
Laving etymological ly no distinction between it and ash colour.         In like
 manner the Latin fuscus comes from tpurxuv, uttulare, at noticed by Tooke;
 and has the same real meaning, as well as the same application, as brown.
 Query, Whence come fuhus and uquilus ?
     White comes from the Mocso Gothick ©jYtJjCjjVN» Spumare. Our
 word Gray is derived from gepcjnian, injicere, meaning the colour of
 tainted, infused, or damaged articles, and is most properly used when ap
 plied to mixtures, which appear as if tainted or tinged with foreign co
 lours, as the salt and pepper mixtures, &c.
    The dilutions of yellow by white are called straw colour.
    Black has probably the same root as " bleak," perhaps from blseap,
 and signifies deprived of colour,
                                                                        reading

poetic writings in matters of philosophy.

X.     Combination of the Electric Column, the Thermometer,
    Barometer, and Hygrometer in one Instrument, for Electro-
   atmospherical Researches.        By A Correspondent.
                             To  Mr. TUlock.
Sir,      The    electric column of De Luc promises to be not only
an interesting but also a useful apparatus,     as its powers seem to
be influenced by the electrical state of the atmosphere.        It has
occurred to me, that a combination which would at one view give
all the different states of the atmosphere, would be very con
venient in electro-atmospherical researches. If you should con
sider the following worthy a place among your more important
communications, it is much at your service.
                                   Yours, &c.
                                                                  D.
    I trust the plan will not require much explanation. It may be
sufficient to say that A (Plate I. fig. 6) is a powerful column insu
lated on Mr. Singer's plan; C, a thermometer; and B, a barometer,
which should have a brass or an ivory index with a gilt wire to
form a communication with the bottom of the column ; the
parts E F may be covered with sealing-wax ; G may be a small
figure or a glass tube ; D is the index of a catgut hygrometer
 stretched on small pulleys on the bottom of the stand, as is re
presented by H  I (fig. 7 and 8.)

 Sir,     Evident justice      to the Parties who direct the Govern
 ment Trigonometrical Survey of our Island, carrying on under
 the Board of Ordnance,        and toward a highly respectable and
 able Mineralogist and Geological Investigator (the President this
 year of the Geological Society) requires of me, without delay, to
                                 D 4                         apologize

t56          A Geologist    is attacked to the  Trig. Survey.
 apologize     for, and correct the too hasty doubts which I hate
 thrown, in pages 427 and 431 of your xlviiith volume, on the al-
 ledged fact, of Dr. MacCulloch (whose chemical services in the
 Board's Establishments are well known and appreciated) being
 associated with Col. Mudge and Capt. Colbv in the Trig. Sur
 vey, for applving the principles of Geological investigation, to
 the ascertaining of the subficial structure of the vicinity of each
 Station therein.
     Some of the gentlemen who honour me by their friendship,
 whom I had supposed very likely to know of any such associa
 tion, or investigation being on foot,      as I have mentioned, were,
 as   I had the means of ascertaining (even since your last number
  appeared), unacquainted therewith, and that most others of my
 acquaintance were equally so, I had reasons to conclude : and
 besides, the notification I have thrown doubt upon, assumed, that
 Dr. M. would be "going from station to station with" the Trig.
  Surveyors, contrary to the fact.         These circumstances misled
 me from the course I ought to have followed, of making direct
 inquiries, before so expressing myself in print.
      I have sincere pleasure in adding, that I now understand,
  Dr. MacCulloch entered near three years ago on the task, taking
  the Country before him in such order, locally, as he judged best
  adapted to his investigations, of ascertaining the Geological facts
  regarding the vicinity of each Station.        The great abilities dis
  played by     Dr.  M.  in   the  many valuable  Papers with which he
  has enriched the volumes of the Geological Transactions, and
  his known preference, to depending on his own personal observa
  tion, as to identity or order of svperposition of the terrestrial
  Masses, to dependence on any Geognostic Rules, founded merely
  on the Mineral characters of hand- specimens collected (however
   numerous they may be), which seems so common among those,
   who would degrade Geology into a mere "branch of Mineralogy ;"
   all those considerations excite in me great expectations, and a
   strong desire to see the results of Dr. M's labours towards the im
   portant objects, on which I have been solicitous for 15 years past,
   as explained in your last number.        If you can oblige me by in
   sertion at this very late period of the month I shall feel highly
    obliged, and am, sir,

XII.      On the indispensible Necessity of perfectly ventilating
    Coal-pits, and the Insufficiency and Danger of Safety -lamps,
    as Substitutes for such Ventilation.            By Mr. John Farey,
    Sen.   Mineral Surveyor.
                              To   Mr. Ttllocfi.
SiRj      As    your correspondent, Mr J. Murray, affects now great
moderation in the discussions carrying on, regarding safety-                 1
lamps for coal-pits, and says, in your last number, p. 453,
                                                                     " It is
painful to see the asperities of controversy" on this subject,  I
think it but just, on the part of Mr. Longmire, myself, and
others, who have been aspersed, to request the insertion of the
following letter, which appeared in a newspaper printed at Car
lisle, called the "Patriot," of February the 10th last:
                " To the Editor the Carlisle Patriot.
    " Sir,  I confess I read inofthe Old Monthly Magazine            of the
 1st  inst., with considerable surprise, and no Utile indignation,
the attempt of Mr. Farey, senior, to damp the efforts of scienti
fic men in the cause of humanity, and to interdict the continued
use of safe-lamps.          He would hang up the safety-lamp like U
 bucket for the extinguishment          of flame, only to be used when
 the house is on
                    fire.   The   safety-lamp    ought ' to be hung up in
 the office of the overlooker, on the pit hill,' and to be used oc
 casionally, forsooth ; i. e. on the recommencement of labour on
 the Monday, or the like.          This is absolutely trifling with hu
man existence ; it is playing at the gp.me of life and death.
 I affirm that it is impossible to calculate on the explosive point,
 so as to take precautionary measures, ensuring safety ; the dis
 engagement of carbonated hydrogen may be instantaneous, and
 the explosive measure filled up on the moment.              Breaking into
 old workings, for example, or excavating seams where the blowers
 are more prevalent, would render the occasional use of the safe-
 lamp a mere non-entity ; to act on Mr.Farey's wise suggestions,
 is neither more nor less than to sport on the verge
                                                             of a precipice.
 Certainly,   I  admit   with  Mr.  Farey,   that the use of the ?afe-lamp
 ought   not  to  relax   our endeavours    in  the grand and  piimary ob
ject   of a  proper   ventilation    but to say that its unintemiitting
 use would relax such efforts, is to argue from the abuse "fa va
  luable discovery, and is illogical.          Farey would, it seems, only
  employ the lamp when it could be of no use : this is redly a cu
  rious specimen of his reasoning, if reasoning it w              be called-
  When the phaenomena on the flame of a candle indie              e that the
   explodible mixture has reached its maximum,             the lamp of Sir
   H. Davy is of no service whatever, for it is instantly extinguished.
   Now, how must those who have laudably directed their labours

58                     On ventilating Coal-pits.
 in this channel think of Mr. Farey and his associates ? This is
 indeed a bad reception, and a sad return towards those who sa
 crifice their means, and direct their time and talents towards
 4
   a consummation so devoutly to be wished.'             Certainly, there
 is no remuneration but that wholesome return which springs up
 in the breast, when it approves the labour.
     " It surely must be apparent to every one the least conversant
 with chemical philosophy, that the sparks from a steel mill,
 which serve to guide the miner in exploring the workings, can
 afford him no certain security. I confess that the recommenda
 tion of Sir H. Davy, for employing red hot charcoal (not exhibit
 ing flame) when his lamp can no longer burn, was one which
 startled me. What is the consequence of such a substitute ? An
 exchange of carbonated hydrogen for carbonic acid gas.  Fire
 damp is supplanted by choke damp  we escape Scylla to suffer
 by Charybdis. The question has somewhat of the complexion of
 the antidote proposed for accidents by fire in the theatres. The
 good people were calmed by the comfortable assurance, that in
 such an occurrence the managers could drown the pit in a few
 minutes 1 Thus, then, we want a lamp to guide us when such
 a desideratum is most needed. This is amply afforded by a pro
position which ,1 published in my ' Elements of Chemical Sci
 ence,' in August last, for bringing the atmospheric air from the
stratum of air contiguous to the floor of the mine, taking advan
 tage of the ascending carburetted hydrogen :  this I proposed to
 do by a flexible tube.      My latest improvement of the chimney
was a spiral tube, having a central sphere. I have since applied
a small lever with a delicate ball at each extremity -this ope
rates in the hollow sphere, and so long as a free current is main
 tained, the ball hangs in medio ; but should unforeseen circum
stances, on which it is impossible to calculate, occasion the flame
to ascend, the air which it propels before     it,  occasions the ball to
rise, and shut the upper aperture; and again, should          a    current
 descend,    the ball      by
                       will,     the impulse,  fall, and   shut the under
aperture.      That the projection of this lamp rested with me in
point of priority, have clearly proved, and not with Dr. Murray
of  Edinburgh.
                 I I  lay this claim, therefore, as the, first who pub
licly proposed an air-tight lamp, to be fed          byair brought from
the floor of the mine.       The mere aperture at top, instead of the
chimney, as proposed      by   Dr. M., gives no assurance of security
whatever.      However     convinced
                                   I   may be of the certain safety of
 the spiral chimney, independent     of  the lever, still I  have wished
 to make assurance doubly sure,'

sible casualty.      My claims of this priority, and description of

before the Society for Preventing Accidents in Mines, by Lord
Percy, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh, by Mr. Neill, Secre
tary to the Wernerian Natural History Society.               My remarks
were before the public in August last, and three months ere this,
in the hands of my printer : I had also communicated my sen
timents hereon even long before, to my friend J. C. Gotch, esq.
banker, Kettering.          Far from underrating the value of Sir H.
 Davy's lamp,       I think    it deserves instant adoption, and to be
continually used.         These lamps may go together  the one is
more convenient for general purposes, the other will act in cases
where its fellow is of no use. Sir H. Davy's exertions in the cause
 of humanity deserve the eternal gratitude of that species of which
 he is an honour.       I confess I see no force in the objections of Dr.
 Thomson to Sir H's safe lamp.
    " If you will allow me, I shall in your next number give such
 cautions in the employment of charcoal, and in the occurrence
 of choke damp in cellars, wells, &c. and the means of subduing
 their effects, as may be useful.

     On this day, reperusing       the letter in the Monthly Magazine
 which Mr. M. thus harshly          and unfairly commented on, and also
 an earlier letter of mine in       the same work, inserted also in your
 xlvth volume, p. 436 and          contrasting these with the numerous
 letters, papers, and essays which have since appeared on the
 subject of inflammable gases in coal pits, I beg to say, that I
 do not observe a single fact or point of my arguments therein,
 which has yet been materially shaken, by any thing which has
 since transpired or been advanced. Indeed, Mr. M. alone seems
 to have had the hardihood, to attack either the matter or the
 manner of my communications ; and in what way and manner he
  (who now affects moderation) did this, your readers will see above.
     In arguing (Monthly Mag. Vol. xli. p. 33.) on the chief and
 peculiar defects of the Newcastle system of Collierying, viz. the
 vastly too greatly extended Works to be ventilated by one up-cast
  Shaft, I assumed only, with Mr. Buddie, that the
                                                             " run of the
 air," or length of laterally air-tight gallery, which required to
  be constantly maintained, " or imminent danger ensues," some
 times exceeds thirty miles!; but on making inquiries, last summer,
  as I passed through, and made a short stay at Newcastle, I was
  then very credibly informed, that I had very greatly under-rated
  the extent of the chief cause, which had occasioned so much fuss
  about safety-lamps ; for that forty, fifty, sixty, and even ninety
  miles of such air-courses were, or had lately been attempted to
  be maintained, between a down-cast and an up-cast shaft ! ! ; and
  that in various parts of this vast single magazine of combustible
                                                                       or

                         On ventilating Conl-pils.
  or explosive    gus, almost proportionally large numbers (above
  what    is usual in large Collieries any-where else) of Men and
  Boys, thoughtless of their danger, were daily employed.
     Judge therefore, reader, who it is who are " sporting on the
  verge of a precipice," "trifling with human existence," " play
  ing at the game of life and death," &c. : I, who have candidly
  pointed out the peculiar circumstances of management, which
 have led to the catastrophes which all deplore, and who have
 laboured to bring back these important Works, not to any new
  or theoretic point of improvement of my own pointing out, but
 merely to the moderate extent       (f  individual underground Works *,
  amd great comparative security to the Men, which they had
  and enjoyed 40 or 50 years aso!, and which the Colliers in
 nearly every other part of the British Empire still enjoy! ; and
 long will continue to do so, I trust, from their Managers being
  fully aware, of the perfect insufficiency and danger of any lamp,
 in place of the effectual ventilation of modeeately extended
 works, especially while conducted on the post and stall, or pillar
 and board system (as about Newcastle), instead of the incompa*
 lably better plan, of "the long-way of working," wherein scarcely
 any pillars are wasted, or empty spaces left, for air or water to
 accumulate in !.
     I lately inspected an underground Work, carried on for five
 years past, in the midst of a considerable Coal district, wherein
 the post and stall plan had entirely been followed, from time
 immemorial, and in which Work, its very considerable money
produce per acre, from the same seams, had been nearly doubled
by the change, to the Derbyshire or long-way of working ! ; and
whereby, security also from accidents, is in a greater degree ob
 tained.     Here, as everywhere else, where I have had opportu
 nities in the last autumn, of consulting experienced Coal-viewers,
 Agents and Overlookers, to the number of 20 or more, I have
found them unanimous, in esteeming Safety-lamps no other than
 dangerous toys ; and calculated to bolster up and prolong a bad
system of working.           While thus supported, and by the con
 scious honesty      of my  own   motives, I shall not be dismayed, or
remain silent, in consequence of all the expressions of " indig
nation," which Lecturers, Chemists, Amateurs or Theorists can
hurl at me.

Sir,  In     your Journal for December I observe a letter by
Mr.   J.Murray, at the close of which is a reference to the lamp
which I have proposed for coal-mines, which seems to call for
some notice from me.     From what he states of a parade being
unnecessarily made with regard to this lamp, and of its being
brought forward as a rival to another, he seems not to be aware
that the paper describing it, which appeared lately in Dr. Thom
son's Journal, is merely the original one read before the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, so far back as November 1815, and which
has not appeared earlier, as the volume of the Transactions con
taining it has only been lately published ; and I thought it un
necessary to deviate from the established practice, and publish
it in any unusual mode. Having announced at first the general
plan, and having sent a copy of the original paper to Newcastle,
as soon as possible after it was read, I conceived myself to have
done all that for the sake of humanity I was called on to do ;
and I was not disposed to excite any party in its support, to make

      XIV.   On the Safe-lamp, and the Ventilation       of Mines.
                           By Mr.    J. Murray.
                              To  Mr. TUloch.
Sir,  Tn virtue of my promise I shall now advert, and that
but briefly, to the methods I have proposed to the Society for
Prevention of Accidents in Coal Mines, to aid the purposes of
ventilation.      And here let me premise that I firmly believe the
present system of ventilation to be radically defective:  so far as
it goes, it proceeds upon the well-known principle that aerial
fluids will flow towards the source of heat and rarefied medium :
but it ought to conjoin with this, a provision for the specific
gravities of those gases which the miner has to contend with ;
namely, hydrocarbonate and carbonic acid gas.
    Towards this desideratum approximations have been made by
the ingenuity of Mr. Ryan and Mr. Menzies.            It may be ques
tioned, however, whether these ingenious plans can in every
case be made practically effective:  repeated and extensive dis
locations would likely render an insulation of the coal-field ex
tremely difficult, if at all to be accomplished ; and there are
other reason^ which will readily present themselves to the re
flecting mind,  as the difficulty of determining the limits of the
 strata, and the like. Add to this, elastic volumes cannot rest
upon each other, without mingling together; the liberated hydro-
carbonate would in the very act of ascent diffuse itself suffi
ciently through the air of .the mine to complete an explosive
 mixture.
                                                                   The

of horn secured   from  accidental   external injury by being sur
rounded with wires; a is the flexible hose which feeds the lampr
by air contiguous to the floor of the mine.     I have already con
tended for the priority of suggesting the structure of a safety-
lamp founded on the specific levity of the fire-damp, and a
comparison of dates will confirm to me the award, b is a hol
low metallic ball attached to the chimney.      This spherical bulb
will be kept constantly supplied with carbonic acid gas and
azote, the products of combustion; and therefore should a dis-
lodgement of fire-damp from the floor of the mine take place,
and the included flame expand upwards, it would never come in
contact with the external atmosphere above, for it would cease
to be flame so soon as it encountered the mephitic airs and
aqueous vapour included in the ball of the chimney-       As for ex
plosion, this would be prevented by the heated rarefied medium
within the cylinder of the lamp.      Experiment taught me also
(and  I was  led to  it,   by
                         considering  that a fowling-piece not cor
rectly and evenly   bored  would   inevitably burst) that explosive
mixtures of gases would not pass through       spiral tube; and such

    For the removal of the carbonic acid gas suggested the pro I
priety of sinking  a well in the lowest part of the pavement of the
mine, as its recipient, and inclined grooves or gutters termina
ting here, to conduct the gas to this reservoir, from all parts of the
field of coal.   As carbonic acid gas may be pumped out like                    li
quid matter, the appendage of an air-pump to the steam-engine,
with a hose connecting the pump-tree with the cavity in ques
tion, would as effectually remove       as       were so much water;

machinery like that of     common barrel churn), be made to con
dense and absorb an estensive volume of the gas, and the chalk
so formed would be precipitated.           fresh portion of quicklime

lime-water, and be made to absorb further volume, and so on.

d&               On the Order      of the   Upper Strata
and unknown       agents.     It is composed chiefly of water-worft      :
fragments     of flints, mixed with sand and clay in various pro
portions.
    Upper Freshwater Formation.  This (in the Isle of Wight)
eonsists of a calcareous rock, in which numerous fossil fresh
water shells are imbedded.          It agrees in character and situation
ivith the corresponding formation in the basin of Paris, and
other parts of the continent of Europe.           Traces of a freshwater
formation are to be observed also in the London basin, between
the alluvium and London clay, consisting of marl with fresh
water shells, and containing also numerous bones of land ani
mals, as the elephant, hippopotamus,               buffalo, elk, ox, &c.
These have been found chiefly at Sheppey, Brentford, Essex,
 Sitffiolk, and Norfolk.      In other places, as at Sheppey, Ems-
worth in Sussex, &c. vast quantities of the fruits of tropical
countries have been found in a corresponding situation.
    Upper Marine Formation.  This bed consists of blueish or
greenish marl and clay containing a great number of fossil marine
shells, which in general are different from those found in the
London clay.         It is known in this country with certainty only
in the Isle of Wight.
    Lower Freshwater Formation.  This formation is ascertained
in the Isle of Wight.         It is placed under the last, and consists
of clay, marl, and sand, with vegetable matter resembling an
imperfect coal or peat, and contains numerous fragments of fresh
water shells.      At the bottom is found a mixture of marine with
fresh-water shells. As the alternation of marine with fresh-water
strata has not been observed in any other part of this country
except the Isletrf Wight, the traces of a fresh-water formation
in the London basin cannot perhaps be referred to this. -
    Sand without Shells.  In the Isle of Wight this sand is ex--
tremely pure ; it is dug at Alum Bay, and is used for making the
best glass.     The Bagshot sand perhaps belongs to this, and pos
sibly   the Grayweathers ; but the positions of these have not yet-
 been -accurately determined.
     London Clay.  This is the blue clay of London, Highgate,
Brentford, Sheppey, Portsmouth, Stubbington, Hordwell, South
 end, Harwich, &c. It is distinguished by its septaria, and its
beautiful and numerous organic remains. In Alum Bay it is the
most northerly of the vertical strata. Bognor Rocks are subor
 dinate to this bed.      It agrees in its fossils and geognostic situaT
im\ with the lower beds of the caleaire grossi&re of the Paris              .
 basis.                                                      

    Plastic Clay and Sa?fd.  The clay in this formation is often
extremely pure, and fit for the potter.          It is much employed in
the gottenes in Staffordshire.            It is seen in Alum Bay, the       .
                                                                           '

trough of Poole, and at the bottom of the blue clay in many
parts of the London basin.      An iriiperfect coal, or lignite, also
frequently occurs in it. This formation corresponds to the French
plastic clay, which lies over their chalk.
   Chalk with Flints. This formation in England extends from-
Flamborough-head      in Yorkshire to a little beyond Lyme Regis
in Devonshire [Dorsetshire]; and, where it is not covered by the
beds above, forms chalk-hills or downs.        It is distinguished by
the regular layers of flint nodules.
   Chalk without Flints.  The inferior bed of chalk in the south-'
east part of England is always without flints.        When the chalk
with flints is wanting, it forms the surface.        The relations of
both maybe seen at the Culver and Compton Bay in the Isle of
Wight, Handfast-point, Beachyhead,     Guildford, Dorking, &e. '
It differs from the former only in the absence of flints, in the'
beds being thicker, and the chalk being sometimes a little
harder.
     Chalk Marl.  This    bed consists of chalk and an intimate mix
ture of clav.   It   is always found below the two last strata.     It
may be readily distinguished from chalk, by its falling to pieces
on being wetted and dried again.          Some varieties of       when
                                                                     a it,

    Green Sand-stone.  The formation to which         have given this5

                                                  calcareous matter,
and contains also mica and green earth.         From the variety in
the proportion of the latter ingredient,    it   is some divided into
                                                      by

                                      a
be made, since these alternate, and pass into each other.                    It   is
found in the wealds of Kent and Sussex, at the foot of the
chalk downs, and        dug at Rygate and Mearsham for firestone.

             XVII.   Proceedings    of Learned Societies,
                          ROYAL SOCIETY.
After       the vacation for the holidays, the Society met on the
9th   of January, and at this and   a subsequent meeting on the 16th
 it was occupied with the reading of New Researches upon Flame,
 by Sir Humphry Davy, which are of a most singular and interest
 ing nature.
    Sir H. Davy divided his New Researches upon Flame into four
 parts. In the first he considered the effects of rarefaction by the
 air-pump, and of condensation on flame.          In the second he ex
 amined the phenomena of rarefaction by heat, in relation to flame
and combustion.        In the third, the effects of the mixture of ga
seous substances not concerned in combustion or flame.            And iu
 the fourth he described various practical and theoretical appli
 cations of the results of his researches.      Rarefaction by remov
ing pressure    he finds, contrary  to  the  opinion of Grothers, has
no influence on combustion, except in relation to the heat pro
duced in rarefied atmospheres.         Combustion continues in rare,
atmospheres as long as sufficient heat is produced in the process
to effect the combination of oxygen with the inflammable basis i
and the degree of rarefaction at which flames are extinguished is
different for every species of flame :  those that require little
heat for their combustion burn in much rarer atmospheres, and
likewise those that produce much heat in their combustion.
 Carburetted hydrogen, which requires a strong heat for its com
bustion, and which produces comparatively little heat, is extin ,
guished in an atmosphere rarefied only four times ; whereas sul
phur, which requires very little heat for its combustion^ burns in
an atmosphere rarefied 20 times ; and phosphorus, which re
quires only a common temperature for its combustion, burns in
an atmosphere rarefied tjO times. By heating atmospheres or ex
plosive mixtures which have ceased to support combustion, or to
explode from rarefaction, combustion or explosion may be made
to take place. Sir H. Davy's general conclusion in the first sec
tion   is, that, whether the atmosphere be rarefied or condensed,
combustion takes place at the same temperature in        it ;   and that
the diminution or increase of heat, from the smaller or larger
quantities burning in rare and condensed atmospheres, are thereal
causes of the extinction, diminution, or increase of combustions
in them.
     In the second section Sir H. shows, in direct opposition to
Grothers, that expansion     by  heat uniformly increases the combus
tibility of gaseous mixtures.      He states  a    fact particularly cu
rious and interesting from the application he has made of         it  in
                                    £
                                    3                            another

70                         Royal Society,
another paper ; namely, that there are slow combustions with
out flame, and which take place at temperatures below the point
of the visible ignition of metal. He determines in this part of the
paper, that the electrical spark or flaine does not produce heat
by compression, but by expansion by an actual increase of tem
perature.
    fn the third section he shows that different elastic fluids have
different .effects in extinguishing flame ; that nitrous oxide is the
lowest, defiant gas the highest, as to this power : and this does
not depend upon capacity for heat or density ; but on an actual
power of abstracting heat, which is much highest in the combus
tible gases, and which seems analogous to conducting power in
solids and fluids. Steam has very low powers of preventing ex
plosion, and azote has low powers compared to inflammable
gases.    The increased cooling power of the azote in condensed
mixtures prevents the combustion from increasing very rapidly,
and the diminished cooling power in rarefied atmospheres inter
feres with a rapid diminution of the heat of combustion ; so that
at all pressures which can occur at the surface of the earth, the
atmosphere still retains the same relations to combustion.
    Sir Humphry began the fourth-section by illustrating the sim
ple explanation which he has always given of the operation of wire
gauze in intercepting flame, by some decisive experiments.        He
pointed out the    limits of the size of the wire and the mesh, which
differ for different flames;  that of phosphuretted hydrogen and
sulphur requiring the smallest mesh, and that of carburetted hy
drogen or fire damp being stopped comparatively by the largest
mesh ; and the law being always as the heal required for burning
the gas, and as the heat produced by the combustion of the gas.
To prevent explosion from passing from a mixture of oxygen and
hydrogen requires 7000 or 8000 apertures to the square inch,
whilst carburetted hydrogen and atmospheric air will not pass
their explosion through a mesh containing 700 or 800j          He re
fers to the form of the miners wire-gauze lamp, which he has
adopted after many experiments, aad which under all circum
stances has been found to offer absolute security.         By the in
crease of the combustibility of gaseous mixtures by heat, he ex
plained the effects of various lamps and fire-places.
    He stated, i:i speaking of meteoric appearances, that falling
stars could not be owing to the combustion of gaseous meteors ;
but that they must be solid ignited masses moving with great ve
locity in the upper regions of the atmosphere.  It would exceed
our limits to attempt to enter into all the applications of these
researches ; and indeed such an attempt would be incompatible
with the nature of the investigations, many of which were too

they offer throughout new views of the doctrine of combustion
and flame, and practical applications of these views.
   On Thursday, Jan. 23, another paper was read by Sir H. Davy,
in which he describes some experiments for rendering invisible
combustions visible. By producing these combustions by a heated
wire of platinum or palladium, the wire becomes ignited, and
continues so as long as the combustion can go on. A simple mode
of illustrating this new principle is by gently heating a fine wire
of platinum having its extremity coiled three or four times, and
plunging it into a wine-glass containing a few drops of ether ; it
will becorrie red hot, and continue red hot as long as any vapour of
ether mixed with air exists in the glass.     It is a combustipn in
visible, except when it is produced by bodies that are tolerably
good conductors, but of small capacity and small radiating powers.
   He applies this new principle to a safety-lamp which will give
light in atmospheres containing so much coal gas as not to be
explosive. The twilled wire-gauze lamp gives a safe light in all
atmospheres that are explosive ; and by a little apparatus placed
in the top of                    beautiful light without flame in all
                    it,
                    it   gives      a
atmospheres, non-explosive     from  fire-damp, that are respirable        ;
and   isrelighted into jlame    explosive mixtures or atmospherical
                                    by
air.
    Part of short paper
           a                Dr. Brewster was also read, detailing
                               by
some further experiments on the effects of heat    changing the
                                                             in
powers of bodies in polarizing light. The Society then adjourned
till the Tth of Febrcary.
                     CALCUTTA ASIATIC SOCIETY.
  At a late meeting of this Society              very interesting com
                                                 several
munications were submitted to its consideration.                Amongst
these was the journal of Mr. Fraser's Tour to the Sources of
the Satlej and Jumna, and thence across           most difficult and in

curious document     was   also   communicated       respecting several
classes of robbers and murderers,       known     in the south of India-
 by the name of Phansesgars, and in the upper provinces               by
                                                                     the

By      an improved process, this substance may now be obtained
in great quantities,    and exceedingly pure.   A few days ago an
experiment was made by a French gentleman, in the laboratory
of the Royal Institution, by which about an ounce of potassium        ,
was obtained from three or four ounces of potash.        The appa
ratus employed    was   a double-recurved gun-barrel, similar to that
usually employed ; but connected at one end with a tube of glass
descending into an open vessel of mercury, which by the pres
sure of the atmosphere tends to maintain a pressure within,
equal to that of the atmosphere.
                    STEAM ENGINES IN CORNWALL.
     Messrs. Lean, in their monthly report of work done by steam
engines, state, that several counters of engines were idle in De
cember.
     The average work of twenty-five reported was 22,319,663
pounds of water lifted one foot high with each bushel of coals.
Besides these, the following appear in the report for December.
    Woolf's engine at Wheal Abraham, loaded 15-1 per square
inch in engine cylinder, lifted 43,3S3,351 pounds with each
bushel. His other engine, at the same mine, loaded 3' 1 per inch,
lifted 25,675,547 pounds:  his engine at Wheal Vor, loaded 12-1
per inch, lifted 35,307,233 pounds : and his engine at Wheal
Unity, loaded 138 per square inch, lifted 32,044,976 pounds
one foot high with each bushel.
    The altered engine at Wheal Chance, loaded 13-4 per inch,
lifted 47,048,844 pounds with each bushel.
     Some of our correspondents have asked us why the lightest-
loaded engine does the least work with the coals ?         They will
understand this by asking themselves another question : Suppose
the load only one ounce, what would the engine then lift with
each bushel ? A certain portion of the coals is consumed in
merely keeping the engine in motion  whether it carries the full
load or not.

DESTRUCTION       OF THE EXTENSIVE COLLIERIES AT CHIRK IN
                            DENBIGHSHIRE.
    On Saturday evening, the 28th of December, owing, as it is
supposed, to inattention in the servants of the Ellesmere Canal
Company, the stop-gates, plugs, &c. for regulating the quantity
of water on that part of the canal which is embanked up to Chirk
aqueduct, were neglected : the fatal consequence was, that the
embankment being overpowered by the great weight of super
fluous water, gave way, and falling down a precipice, completely
dammed up the river Ceriog, which flows below it, and over
which the canal is continued by an aqueduct.        The water being
thus impeded, quickly found its way in another direction, and in.
half an hour every pit belonging to the colliery was filled with
water, earth, gravel, &c.        The machinery was torn in pieces
by the tremendous force of the current, and very considerable
damage done to the surroundingcountry.       Most providentially this
was the only night in which, for several years past, the workmen
were absent from the, pits. They had been allowed a little time
to collect Christmas bounties, &c. and thus this dreadful calamity
is not aggravated by the loss of the many valuable lives which
must have been otherwise inevitably sacrificed.        All the horses
employed     in the  works were   drowned.   The   immediate   loss to
the proprietors of the works is immense; and the destruction of
so valuable a colliery, which has for a long series of years,
produced fuel for the country, and employment for its poor, is
a   public calamity.
                       EXPEDITIONS TO AFRICA.
    The particular details of the unfortunate expedition to explore
the river Congo have since our last publication reached the
Admiralty.      It appears that the ship Congo under the command
of captain Tuckey, with the Dorothy transport in company, arrived
at the mouth of the Congo about the beginning of July. The
Congo having been pifrposely built to draw little water, it left the
 transport, and proceeded alone up the river, to the extent of
 120 miles, when her progress was stopped by rapids and other
difficulties of the current.    Captain Tuckey with all the principal
individuals attached to the expedition then disembarked, resolving
to prosecute their survey by land.     The country as they proceeded
 became barren and mountainous ; and the climate, though mild
  (Fahrenheit's thermometer seldom exceeding 76 degrees by day,
 and never descending below 60 at night,) was so excessively dry
 that it became extremely difficult to procure water.      The people
 are represented as timid and pusillanimous : they opposed no
 obstacle to the progress of our adventurers, and readily furnished
 whatever guides were required.
     After penetrating about 150 miles, (being 120 further than any
 white person had ever been before,) Captain Tuckey and his com
                                                              panions

  74                       Expedition to Africa.
  panions became at last so exhausted by fatigue and the nume
  rous privations, especially of water, to whirh they were exposed,
  that they were obliged to retrace their steps.  With great dif
  ficulty they regained the banks of the Congo : but scarce had
  .they embarked, when the effects of their journey began to di-
  play themselves in the most fatal form.        All of them were seized
  with fever, and in a short time all but one (of those engaged on
  shore) fell victims to its fury.      The following are the names of
  some    of  the principal sufferers :
      Captain Tuckey, commander of the expedition ; Lieutenant
   Hawkev, lieutenant of the Congo ; Mr. Professor Smith, bota
   nist ; Mr. Tudor, comparative anatomist ; Mr. Cranch, col
   lector of objects of natural history ; Mr. Galwey, a friend of
   Captain Tuckey, who volunteered from pure love of science ; and
   Mr. Eyre, the purser.
      In a letter from Mr. Mackerrow, the surgeon of the Congo,
   and who remained on board during the land expedition, the fol
   lowing particulars are added:
      " Of the eighteen who died in the river, fourteen had been on
  shore, marching for some time, and were far advanced before
  reaching the ship.
      " Professor Smith, who saw many of them when taken ill, gave
   to some a dose of calomel, but to others nothing had been ad
   ministered.
      " The fever appeared in some degree contagious, as all the
   attendants upon the sick were attacked, and before we left the
   river it pervaded nearly the whole crew, also some of the trans
  port's ; but as for myself, although constantly among them, I did
   not feel the slightest indisposition until we left the coasl, when \
   was attacked : however, I considered mental anxiety and dis
   turbed rest as the sole causes.
      " Captain Tuckey had been afflicted many years with chronic,
   hepatitis ; and on returning from travellingjfoe weeks on shore,
   he was so excessively reduced, that all attempts to restore the
   energy of his system proved ineffectual.
      " Mr. Tudor was in the last stage of fever before } saw him,
   as were Messrs. Cranch and Galwey.
      '? Professor Smith died in two days after he came under my
   care, during which time he refused every thing, whether as nu
   triment or medicine.
I
      " Lieutenant Hawkey was taken ill after leaving the river, and
  died on the fourth day ; his case was rather singular ; symptoms
  were irritability of stomach, with extreme languor and debility,
  but he had neither pain nor fever.
      " Mr. Eyre had a violent fever, and on the third day breathed
  his last- : before death a yellow suffusion had taken placcj with
  vomiting of matter like coffee ground."
                                                                   The

       The Journals of Captain Tuckey and the gentlemen in the
    scientific departments are, it is said, highly interesting and satis
    factory, as far as they go ; and will no doubt soon be laid before
    the public.

   XIX.     Essays   an Chemical   Philosophy.    By Mr. M. Allen,
                                  Lecturer.
                                  Essay   I.
   It   is intended in these Essays to offer a brief outline of the laws
  and principles of natural science ; and as some of the ideas pro
   posed to be offered, may be found to differ from the principles
   and reasoning which have been advanced by others, the reader
   is requested not to be hasty in either receiving or rejecting what
   may be advanced, but to suspend his decision till the way
  has been cleared for their statement, and their application to
  chemical affinitv, electricitv, caloric, light, astronomy, and the
  immense detail of facts in Nature and in chemical or artificial
  operations, has been exhibited.
      The bare mention of the subject precludes the necessity of
   argument to show its importance.  It is the desideratum of'
  science.     It is true that the operations and effects of the power
   of Nature, called attraction, have been submitted to rigid and
   mathematical calculation : but it is equally true, that only by a
   misnomer have these been denominated the laws of its action;
   for they merely point out the uniformity of those effects which
   the laws and principles of its action produce.        The same mis
   application of the words " laws and principles" is committed in
   applying them to those circumstances by which the operation
   of these laws and principles is facilitated, opposed or modi
   fied, such as pulverization, solution, gravity, &c.     The subject
   therefore requires, as has been said, no argument to establish its
   importance, however desirable it might be that more adequate
   powers than the writer can boast had undertaken the present
   tank.     He feels however no apprehensions for the fate of his
   attempt, for truth is the object he aims at ; and so far as he
   may succeed in making this manifest, he knows that, in this phi
  losophical age, he lias nothing to fear from the hostility of pre
  judice. All opposition, however, is not prejudice.        Opposition
   often exerts itself beneficially in defence of truth ; but prejudice
  resists and presumes to answer before it has examined and un
   derstood the things it had predetermined to oppose.
      Without further preface, I will at once proceed to the classifi
  cation or division of science, intended to be pursued, and to state
  the reasons for adopting the names and arrangements employed
   in such classification or division ;  and, as the primary head,
  what relates to attraction  attractive agencies  and passive sub
   stances.

                                  I. jit traction.
    Attraction, in common language, is applied both to the cause,
and to the effect which that cause produces ; and though philo
sophers now use it in a more abstract and arbitrary manner, yet
they appear to have chosen it in the first instance, rather as de
scriptive of effects, than as expressive of any abstract idea they
could form or convey of its essence.            In this sense Newton con
sidered the word ; and though he adopted and applied                    from    it,
the want of       more suitable word, in the most enlarged manner,
                   a
he complained of those who mistook his reasons for this, and
evidently considered attraction as only the effect of another
power*.       The term at traction, as well as the term repulsion, can
express only the mere property of a power, and                  therefore an
                                                                     is
improper     name    for   the  power    itself   and
                                                  ;     philosophers would
render an important service to science, were they unanimously
to consent to introduce for the latter some other word more de
 fined and correct in its application, as the vis natures, or cause
 producing attraction and repulsion, or attractive and repulsive
 or other effects.     The reasons for this will appear to more ad
vantage       by
               and  by.     Let    suffice at present, to state, to define
                                      it
and restrict the term, that the reader may understand the sense
invariably meant to attach to              in the remarks which may be
                                            it
 laid before him in these Essays.           The vis naturae        employed
                                                                          is
as   a term to express the sole grand power or principle of Nature;
and, agreeably to this- view,           defined to be that " cause which
                                           is
produces all the motion and union               matter."
                                                 of
    This general definition        offered, from
                                      is               conviction that this

power    is alone sufficient to explain all the phenomena of Nature
 and of Art.      Let     not be imagined, that

 the trtie philosopher, the servant of nature, traces the operation
 and endeavours to ascertain the laws of that power by which all
 these are produced.
     In this sense then I contend, that the power which in che
 mistry binds and unites matter together, is the same power that
 carries matter from one point to another ; and I therefore de
 fine it to be " that power which produces all the motion and
 union of matter." According to this view of its operations, it is
 not necessary to call to the aid of science a repulsive or pro
jectile power, in order to explain either the minute or extended
 movements and changes, or " motion and union," of matter,
 which are for ever going on in every part of the creation.
 Nature is but another word for this power. The operations
 are the objects of all natural science ; and circumstances alone
 constitute the difference of each of our artificial divisions of hu
 man knowledge.         It has been said " that electricity, caloric and
 light are powers by which repulsion is produced ; and the proofs
adduced in support of this opinion are, that, by the application of
 these in an increased degree, " repulsion is established between
the particles of matter, and the force of attraction is overcome:"
and hence, it is said, " solids become fluids, and fluids gases."
But these effects, as well as every other attributed to a repulsive
power, may, it is believed, be better explained without the in
troduction of more than one universal power of Nature.
    Repulsion is a term which can never be used with propriety
as expressive of a distinct cause of effects, contrary                and in
opposition     to  those  of  attraction,    if  by  that  word    we   mean
the power of Nature.          It may indeed be used as a descriptive
term, and to this it ought to be restricted.             We may speak of
certain powers having a repulsive effect on matter, but never
 {with propriety) of repulsion itself as the power or primary
cause of any effect whatever.
    It is said, " the magnetic and electric attractions so far agree
with the attraction of gravity as to operate at sensible distances,
and even, as has been attempted to be proved, according to the
same law          and yet these powers with caloric and light are
classed together in the same system of chemistry*,
                                                                    " as the
powers by which repulsion is produced."              In fact, this definition
of repulsion    is not the  definition  of  it  as a  cause, but of certain
effects of other powers,     to  which    the   name   "repulsion" is ap
plied as descriptive of their kind or mode of operation. And in
this sense alone its applicalion,is proper. The definition says in
direct words, " Electricity, caloric, and light, are (themselves)
the powers by which repulsion (itself) is produced;" and yet to

  the consideration of this word, not as a descriptive term of effects,
  but as a name for a distinct power of causation, five pages are
  devoted for one that is given to attraction, as the grand and
  universal power of Nature, of whose effects Newton traced with
  an unerring hand the grand and extensive outlines.
      The same cause will always produce the same effects, the cir
  cumstances being the same.          Now these powers, electricity, ca
  loric, and light, are invariably treated as powers principally con
 cerned in the attractions which take place among the particles
  of matter, or chemical attraction. How then are they said to
 produce effects the very reverse of attraction ? In fact, this con
 fusion has originated in the arbitrary and undefined application
  of the term attraction: it is one cause which produces different
  effects, either (as will hereafter be proved in detail) from dif
ference of circumstances, or in the degree of the same power
                                                                        
 from these causes arises its two-fold action, of carrying bodies
 and the particles of bodies in one direction, and drawing them
 in another.
     Attraction' binds matter together, and the same power (I
 contend) carries it from one point to another. The latter is the
 repvhion of chemists, but the repulsive effects of Nature; and
 these varied modifications of the same power serve but to exhibit
 so many instances of the superior and all-pervading omnipotent
 influence of that power.           Artificial and arbitrary distinctions
 have made Science and Nature two very different things.              Che
 mistry has been defined as " the science which treats of the in
sensible motions of matter," or say " of the minute and intri
 cate changes of Nature."            Now, if the minute and intricate
 changes of Nature are connected with her sublime and extended
 movements,  if minute atoms and celestial masses are moved by
 the same power, regulated by the same laws, and merely modified
 by circumstances,  then this definition is defective, and it 'only
 applies partially. If then it be allowed that the object of chemistry
 is to examine the one, and that not only the most difficult, but
 which must contain the first principles of the other, that other
 and subsequent part of natural science is a continuation of the
 first, and they ought to be considered as parts of one whole.
  Chemical philosophy* I would therefore define to be that science
 which investigates the movements and changes of Nature, and
 endeavours to ascertain the laws and principles by which these
 effects are produced.       This is its proper object  it is the golden
 key by which we unlock the secrets of Nature, and arc enabled
 to discover the laws of that power by which Nature produces ajl
 her operations.

    Distinctions      are made between     it and other branches of science,
making it a      separate and insulated portion of human knowledge.
Whereas every student must have observed that, in every advance
he makes in chemistry, his views of Nature are enlarged, and he
is enabled more correctly to ascertain the laws and principles of
the operation of the grand power, the cause of all the motion
and union of matter.             The further therefore we advance, the
more these artificial divisions of science will be confounded, and
the more certainlv will be preindicated a time when they will be
lost in the magmtude and splendour of trnth.
    Notwithstanding these partial definitions and arbitrary di
stinctions, every description we have of the powers, the objects,
and the application of this science does more justice to its im
portance, and develops, not an insulated portion of knowledge,
but, in fact, all that we include by the phrase Natural Philosophy,
and, more than this, the word Chemistry implied and included.
 I am firmly persuaded that improved chemistry, or, which is the
same thing, correct views on the laws which attraction or the
power of Nature observes, will simplify science, and render its
acquirement easy, delightful, and rapid.                It will not appear
strange that I should hold chemistry destined to this honour,
 after what has already been said ; nor do I argue so much from
 the wonders it has already accomplished, as from the nature of
 the science.        Its professed object is to remove the veil from the
 face of Nature,  to discover the wonderful properties of mat
 ter,  and to become acquainted with the mysterious power by
 which they fare made to produce the various movements and
 changes in the order of things, as well those of Nature, as those
 of art in civilized society. Does it not comprehend the elements
 of every science?         Is it not the centre and circumference of a
 great   circle,  in  which   they all have their origin and termination ?
 Can it be otherwise, when its sole consideration is the primum
 mobile of matter ?

  the surface of the water to some distance from the spot imme

                            To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,  During        the reign of pedantry, knowledge that was not
 dug out of a folio was considered as trifling,? and beneath a man
 of letters.   But now, the diffusion of science in periodical publi
 cations has been found so useful to mankind, that men of the
 first eminence do not disdain to send their contributions to li
 terary journals.
     I was led to these reflections by some useful medical papers,
 which I have lately seen in the Philosophical Magazine, and in
 other publications,, in which medical knowledge of the first im
 portance has been communicated to the public.
     The columns of that excellent paper The Star have lately
 been filled with answers to a riddle, which it was said had been
 proposed by Miss Seward.          This good-natured condescension
 could only be attributed to the liberal desire of giving to some
 of various competitors the chance of gaining 50/. I have rea
 son to doubt the existence of the legacy which ha? given birth
 to so many rhimes.        But I now, sir, beg leave by vour means
 to offer fifty guineas reward, for the solution of a problem
 which would be really useful to my fellow creatures.          It is a
 case in medicine ; and I promise to pay fifty guineas to any per
 son who shall point out a cure for the disease, or a part of that
 sum proportioned to the degree of palliation which may be pro
 duced by his prescription.
     As 1 have been your correspondent from the commencement
 of your Magazine, in 1797, to the present time; and as I have
 by other means been known to you, you will, I think, trust to
 the performance of my promise.
     Should this public application be successful, it would I think
 open the way to similar proposals for the advancement of the
 practical part of medical science, giving a motive and an op
 portunity for the exertion of latent merit.
                   I am, sir,
                              Your obedient servant,

   Z: of seventy-two years of age, of uniformly temperate and
active habits, and of health in general good, though not robust,
was afflicted twenty years ago with the jaundice arising from
gallstones which have not since troubled him ; and three years
ago, with a hernia humor alls, which suppurated, and left the pa
tient considerably debilitated.       Some time after this disease,
his stomach became disordered, and has ever since been liable
to loss of appetite, extreme flatulency, and frequent vomitings
This vomiting has usually occurred at night, about eight or ten
hours after dinner.      Sometimes, but rarely, food was ejected
from the stomach.        In general a bitter fluid, resembling bile,
was thrown up.       The violence of these symptoms sometimes in
termitted for three or four weeks, and then returned again, as if
from some noxious accumulation in the stomach.
   Of course the patient was weakened and somewhat emaciated
by the continuance of this disease; but his spirits, and the activity
of his mind, have at no time been depressed.            Every article of
diet that is considered    as flatulent   had  been  at different times
sedulously excluded.      Animal and vegetable food have been tried
alternately and in conjunction.      Abstinence from wine, and from
all fermented liquors, has also been tried ; and these trials have
been made with care by a person used to experiment, and whose
appetite is entirely subservient to control; and from repeated trials,
he has found nothing which has appeared peculiarly obnoxious
to his stomach, but fried fat, and the skinny or sinewy parts
of meat, and the acetous acid.
   At different times, wine of all sorts, and malt liquor, have
been disagreeable to him.        At other times, Port wine, mixed
with twice the quantity of water, has been his beverage at din
ner, with sometimes one, or at most two small glasses of Port
wine after dinner.     But malt liquor, viz. small beer of a good
quality, has seemed to agree with him better than any other li
quid.    Water, which in his neighbourhood is excellent, has not
been found salutary  for whether water, beer, or wine, or meat,
or vegetables, or simple puddings, or roasted apples, made part
M his diet, the same inordinate flatulency and sometimes subse
 quent vomiting have recurred.        It is to be observed, the acidity
which usually attends common indigestion has not been a sym
 ptom in this disease.
    The bowels have in general been kept in a proper state by a
small quantity of aloes taken in the form of Darwin's dinner
pills, which has never produced any constriction nor any excess.
    Various remedies have been proposed by the medical friends
of the patient, who is happily known to many men of medical
eminence.     Opium, bitters, alkalies have been tried; but every
kind of drug seems to have been ineffectual.        Iudeed the patient,
                                                                 though

 though he has the most sincere regard for individuals of the
 medical profession, and a high opinion of their skill, is not at all
 inclined to tamper with his constitution.
     There is another symptom attendant upon this disease, which
 must be mentioned.          Ever since his recovery from the hernia
 humoralis, three years ago, his urine has never returned to its
 natural colour, but has constantly been of a whevish appearance,
 yet without flocculi or gluten.     It has been voided in usual quan
 tities in the day time, but with unusual frequency in the night.
At times the urinary secretion has been affected by a strange
propulsion of wind from the urethra, attended with a considerable
 hissing or explosive noise, and ejecting a white fluid that has the
exact appearance of cuckoo-spittle ; but which, on being touched,
 appears to be nothing but common urine mixed with air, with
out any gelatinous consistence.         This symptom is always at
 tended with a slight distension of the rectum, so that the patient
cannot determine the source from whence this gas is evolved ;
but this affection is not attended with any pain or inconve
 nience.
     The pulse has usually been regular, beating from 72 to 86 in
 a minute ; at times however it has intermitted, and totally stopt
 for some seconds ; but this irregularity has of late been less fre
 quent.
     At the beginning of dinner, a spoonful or two of soup, or the
first morsel he eats, particularly if salt or spiced, produces a
profuse perspiration on the head, though at other times neither
 heat nor exercise produces perspiration.       

 XXII.      Observations on the Advantages arising from the Use of
     the Wire-gauze Safety-lamp, commonly called The Davy.
     By Mr. John Buddlts.
H aving        observed in some of the periodical publications      cer
tain remarks on Sir H. Davy's lamp, which in my mind appear
to have originated in motives unconnected with truth and the
improvement of science, I feel myself called upon to do an act of
                                                                justice

              the Use   of the Wire-gauze Safety-lamp.              91
justice to the merit of the invention, in a public statement of its
great utility and extensive use in the coal-mines of this country.
   It   is not to be expected that     any great discovery should   be
brought to light without subjecting its author to the envy and
insult of dabblers in science. Enough of rancour and spleen have
certainly been shown in this case.  But I shall not take up my
time with enumerating the names and the misrepresentations of
those officious and mischievous persons, who have endeavoured
to persuade the world that there is little either of merit or utility
in this invention: their motives are too apparent not to be di
stinctly seen through, by all observing and liberal-minded men.
1 must, however, in justice to myself, most positively contradict
a calumny which has been industriously circulated, and I feel the
greatest reluctance in noticing this vile report, because it is a
libel upon the honour and integrity of Sir H. Davy, as well as
myself. It has been reported that I had clandestinely communi
cated certain ideas of Mr. Geo. Stevenson on a safety-lamp, to
Sir H. Davy,  than which there never was a more gross, a more
unfounded, or more malignant statement circulated.          I think it
right to notice this in the strongest terms, lest the falsehood
should finally pass for a truth. It should have been contradicted
sooner, had 1 not thought it of a nature too ridiculous to be re
 ceived with credit: even at present I could not have been in
duced to notice so contemptible a slander, were I not assured
 that it still continues to be propagated.
     The wire gauze lamp, however, is in use, and the benefits that
 it offers to mankind must in-time subdue the uneasy sensatiom
 of envy and ingratitude that it has excited. During the last ten
 months it has been extensively employed in all the collieries
 under my inspection ; and it gives me the highest pleasure to be
 able to state, that during that time not the slightest accident by
 fire has occurred from its use, though several hundreds of lamps
 are daily employed.
     In the parts of mines where fire-damp prevails, the surveys
 and inspections are now carried on by the light of the lamp with
 out apprehension of danger from explosion ; for experience has
 shown us, that, with the caution of keeping it in proper repair,
 it is absolutely safe ; and for the truth of this, I appeal to all
 my professional brethren who have had occasion to use       it, with
   out fear of contradiction.
     The colliers never hesitate   amoment to take     itinto any rc-
  spirable part  ofa  .mine,  however much   it may be  charged   with
  fire-damp;    for, whenever it appears   that the air,  either  from
  discharges of gas, or from casual interruptions of the circulating
  Current, becomes explosive,  only give the collier his Davy, and
                                                                    im

92          Observations on Ike Advantages       arising from
pure atmosphere,     that he would do in any other sitoiation with
a candle.
    There has been much quibbling about the perfect safety of the
wire-gauze lamp.        1 scarcely know how the words perfect safety
can apply to any invention for the preservation of human life ;
but when we have seen some hundreds of the wire-gauze lamps
in daily use for several months past, in all varieties of explosive
mixture, in the most dangerous mines of this country, without
the slightest accident occurring, it seems only reasonable to in,-
fer, that they approximate as nearly to perfect safety as any thing
of human contrivance or manufacture can be expected to do.
    It would, however, be quite unreasonable to expect that accw
dents are never to happen, where the wire-gauze lamps are used;
for it must always be remembered, that, setting aside the chance
of their being damaged by some of the casualties incidental to
coal mining, they are to be intrusted to the management of a
body of men amongst whom negligent individuals will be found,
who may use damaged lamps, or expose the naked flame to the
fire-damp, in spite of the utmost vigilance of the overmen and
inspectors of the mines.        Instances of great negligence have oc
curred, fortunately without any ill consequences  always with the
dismissal of the offender from his employment ; but it would be
absurd to condemn the lamp, or even to quibble upon its want of
safety, on this account.
    Independent of the principle of safety from explosion, which
the wire-gauze affords, I do not hesitate to assert its superiority
over every other medium which has yet been contrived for emit
ting light in safety-lamps, inasmuch as its flexibility enables it to
sustain very great violence.        This I say of the common gauze,
which has hitherto been used.          The twilled gauze, which Sir H.
has lately adopted, is of such strength as in a great measure to
obviate every objection on the score of weakness, or liability to
be damaged.       It is a substance Which unites the great advan
tages of durability, and transmitting sufficient light.           Of the
wire-gauze     lamp,     therefore, whether with plain or twilled
gauze, my decided opinion       is,   that
                                        it    so greatly excels all other
lamps which   I    have hitherto seen, with respect to safety, con
venience, and light, that           should not think myself justified
in using any of them while   I I    possess the highly superior advan
tages  of it. I  do   not  wish  to  speak invidiously of the labours of
other men, but would have      it    understood, thatI    have been in
fluenced in my conduct in this affair     by   rational and disinterested
motives ;    and (when the responsibility    I    am under is  duly con
sidered)  no  one  can  certainly   disbelieve  me  when
                                                      I     say,by   con
scientious and moral considerations.
   Both safety apertures and tubes occurred to Sir H. Davy, in
                                                                     ,the

the very outset of his inquiries ; but besides the complexity of
tubes, and the difficulty of admitting sufficient air to feed the
flame by apertures, glass, or some other transparent substance,
had to be employed, as a medium for the transmission of light,
and these are imminently liable to accident.            He therefore re
linquished    these  discoveries, and adopted cylinders of wire-gauze,
on account of their combining the advantages of transparent
substances without being liable to their inconveniences * ; and
the same reasons, 1 have no doubt, have decided others in the
choice of the wire-gauze lamp.
   Great pains have heen taken to impress the public mind, that
certain viewers of this neighbourhood bruited about the excellence
of Sir H. Davy's lamp, and brought it into use in preference to
others of some pretended superior merit.           The falsehood of this
calumny is only equalled by its absurdity.           Is it likely, in the
name of common sense, that those to whose care the lives of so
many of their fellow-creatures are intrusted, and who also risk
their own existence daily on the wire-gauze lamp, should have
adopted it from any other consideration than that of a thorough
conviction of its exceeding every other description of lamp, in
safety, simplicity, and utility?       It would certainly be expecting
too much of human nature to suppose that such a compliment
could be paid to any one, let his rank in society cr his eminence
in science be what they may. Such an idea could only have
sprung from the conceited opinions of those closet and fireside
viewers, who know little more of a coal-mine than its name, and
who cannot be supposed to be competent to sit in judgement on
matters in which they are wholly devoid of experience: and it is
only from such, that we have ever heard of any objections to the
wire-gauze      lamp.
   No   one    that has actually the charge of a fiery colliery has
hitherto denied the safety of this lamp, or set it on a level with
any that have been constructed on modifications of its principles.
It can scarcely happen that unprejudiced and practical men can
have any doubts on the subject; and though much abuse has
been bestowed on our profession, for ignorance, stupidity, aver
sion to improvement, and the like, I am, however, enabled to
state, that, at least in the present instance, the viewers of this
 country have readily adopted a great improvement in the science
of mining.        The schemes of visionaries and theorists may have
been treated with indifference ; \\xt real improvements have al
ways, I believe, been readily patronized by the coal owners of this
 country.

                 lamp. By W. P. Knight, Esq.
                            To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,     In  my letter written to you last month, on the very
 absurd claim advanced by Mr. Brandling, I stated it as my opi
 nion, that with respect to dates so near each other as those
 quoted by Mr. Hodgson and Mr. Brandling, it was difficult to
 draw any inference as to priority.       In perusing, however, the
 evidence with more attention, I feel it necessary to alter my opi
 nion.    I had turned over the leaves of Dr. Thomas Thomson's
 Journal, and in his account of the Royal Society for the last
 year, I found in the notice of Sir H. Davy's papers no mention
 made of either tubes or safe apertures. On mentioning this to a
 Fellow of the Royal Society who was present when these papers
 were read, he informed me that nothing could be more inac
 curate than Dr. Thomson's, account.
     That in the first paper, read Nov. 9, it was distinctly stated
 that explosion from fire-damp would not pass through small
 tubes, and that small apertures were insisted upon in the safe-
 lamp ; and that the great object of the second paper, read Nov.
  16, was to enforce the use of tubes or safe apertures. The same
 gentleman mentioned that he had seen a lamp fed with air by
 four safe tubes in Sir Joseph Banks's library, in the middle of
November.      On referring back to the Philosophical Magazine,
 J find safe apertures and tubes distinctly mentioned as forming
leading circumstances in Sir H. Davy's papers.
    Now the Rev. John Hodgson states, that he publicly com
municated to various persons Sir H. Davy's discovery, that ex
plosions from fire-damp would not pass through tubes of small
diameter, on Nov. 2d and 6th, that Sir H. Davy had made a
safe-lamp, and that this was mentioned to one of Mr. George
Stevenson's employers; yet Mr. Stevenson shows no lamp with
small tubes till Nov. 2 1 .   Before this time he had made his ex
periments with a tube and a slider. Will any person believe that
Mr. G. Stevenson did not endeavour to profit by what he had
heard Sir H. Davy had done ? Besides, if he had an independent
claim, why was it not made at this time ? When Mr. G. Ste
venson's third lamp with holes was brought forward Dec. 5th ;
this was stated to be the safe-lamp* that he had made before
Sir H. Davy's researches were published.       But I must conclude
so evident a case.

 After        having thus explained all that is at present known, on
 the direction     of these two magnetic forces in different parts of the
earth, it remains for us to consider their absolute intensity.
 This has been much less attended to than the variation and dip}
 which, no doubt, arises from its being more difficult to measure
 with exactness.        In this department, I know of no accurate ob

 in the expedition of Admit ul d'Entrecasteaux*.

 96             On the Laws of Terrestrial Magnetism
    The researches of M. Humboldt on this subject have brought
 to light a very remarkable phenomenon, which      the general-            is,
  increase of    the hitensity in proceeding from the magnetic equator
   towards the poles.
     The same compass which at the departure of M. Humboldt
  gave 245 oscillations in ten minutes at Paris, gave only 211 at
  Peru; and has constantly varied in the same direction, that to
             it                                                                           is
  say, the number of oscillations has always diminished in ap
  proaching the magnetic equator, and always increased in re
  ceding from   it   towards the north.        These differences cannot be
  attributed to a diminution of the magnetic strength of the com
 pass nor can we suppose
      ;                           it     would be weakened        the effect by
  of time and heat for, after residence of three years in the
                       :               a
  warmest country of the earth, this compass again gave as rapid
  oscillations at Mexico as at Paris.           Lastly, M. Humboldt neg
  lected nothing in his observations to ensure exactness: and they
  have since been confirmed       by    the results which he has found in
  making     the   needle   oscillate  successively in the magnetic meri
 dian,   and  in  the  plane  at  right angles to it: for the dip obtained -
  from these data, agrees perfectly with that                     by
                                                           experiment,                     al
 though he did not then know the connexion between these ele
 ments which has since been pointed out                 M. Laplace. The
                                                         by
 exactness of these observations never having been called in ques
 tion, the truth of the consequences derived from them must also
 be admitted  :     and this
                           is     the increase of the terrestrial magnetic
 force, in proceeding from the magnetic equator towards its poles.
The experiments made         by     M. Rossel, at Brest and in New Hol
 land, lead also to the same conclusion.
     The explanation just given of our knowledge of the magnetism
 of the earth,    is sufficient to show how very imperfect         is.           it       Ig
norant as we are of an immensity of essential data, principally
with respect to the variation, we cannot yet expect to arrive at
its true causes.        We can therefore only seek for some empiric
laws, which,    by   embracing the greatest possible number of facts,
may bring before us their numeric relations, and point out the
principal elements on which to rest the observations.
 I    have already mentioned, that         a great portion of the observed
dips, especially     in  those  parts  of  the  globe where the magnetic

 action of two magnetic centres placed at a small distance one
 from the other, near the centre of the earth.             Both M. Hum
 boldt and myself have been led to this result in the work which
 I have mentioned above, and our Memoir was already published
 when I learned that the celebrated astronomer Mayer had also
 arrived at the same conclusion, in discussing the dips known in
 his time : and that he even used it to represent the variations, in
 a Memoir read to the Society of Gottingen, but never printed*.
The son of this great astronomer having been so obliging as to

                                          :
vered, in an experimental manner, that the law of magnetic at
 tractions     reciprocally as the square of the distance.

    This consequence, which we have both deduced from elements
 so different, appears to indicate something more than a merely
empiric law.              therefore necessary to examine               little

for then the magnetic equator would be              great circle perpendi   a
cular to the right line drawn              the two centres of action, andj
                                                           by
there would not result from             the inflexion which we have ob

served     inthe South Sea.       In other respects, such a magnet, in
whatever way        might be placed, would necessarily give symme

formable to the facts observed, especially in the South Sea and
the continent of Asia.

depart from        as little as possible

that it  represents   the   observations     made  in Europe and in the
Atlantic Ocean sufficiently well, let us try to make such            modi                      a

where the magnetic equator suddenly experiences its inflexion.
We shall arrive at this        placing     by

98                  On the Laws of Terrestrial Magnetism
this magnet, so as to cause the anomalies which occur on thk
side of the globe to disappear, and also to make the small dips
that have been observed to take place in the southern part of
the South Sea, agree with the large dips which take place in
North America.        By thus dividing some other secondary centres
in the points of the globe where the irregularities of the variations
appear most extraordinary, it is probable that we should end, by
representing all of them with exactness, as also the dip3 and in
tensities.     Thus it is in the system of the world : the principal
motion produced by the action of the Run, is modified by the
perturbations that are caused by the small masses of the planets.
But as it is necessary to know the places of these masses, in or
der to calculate their influence, so likewise it is necessary that
the most accurate observations should point out the position of
the different secondary magnetic centres, before we can compute
 their effects.
    Is the central magnetic action, indicated by these phaenomena
with so much probability, really produced by a magnetic nucleus
contained in the interior of the terrestrial globe ; or, is it hot
the principal resultant of all the magnetic particles disseminated
 in its substance?      Of this we are ignorant: but the last sup
position appears     to be the most probable.    The secondary cen
tres would then be determined by some local attractions be
coming preponderant.         And, indeed, the observations show in
a way not to be doubted, that the general system of dips, of
variations, and of magnetic intensities, is very sensibly modi
fied, sometimes in a sudden aud irregular manner, by the neigh
 bourhood of great chains of mountains.          This appears to be
confirmed by the singular inflexion which the magnetic equa
 tor experiences near the numerous archipelagos of the South
Sea.     It is well known, indeed, that the islands with which this
 sea is scattered, are only the summits of very high mountains
 which elevate themselves quite to a peak from the midst of an
 ocean where we can find no bottom.            If the madrepores, of
 which they appear to be composed, only form a thin layer, and
if,  as has been supposed         by
                                   some very able naturalists, the re
mainder of their mass has been produced            the action of sub
                                                   by
terraneous fires, the system of these islands would form the most
 extensive volcanic chain that there     on the surface of the globe.

 Then, all the irregularities produced        by
                                              this system in the ge

Necessarily change the chemical state and the natural arrange
ment of the ferruginous parts, in places where it exercises itself ;
which changes cannot be made without affecting the direction
of the magnetic needle, and modifying the general action of the
globe in those points.         There are, indeed, several examples of
these alterations which have happened suddenly; and M. Hum
boldt has observed similar ones at Peru, after a great earth
quake*.       It is therefore possible* that the particular magnetic
centre belonging to the South Sea is owing to similar causes.
There existj without doubt, analogous ones in other countries :
and is it not their alterations            which during the last two
hundred years have produced these changes of variation of the
compass ; which changes are so irregular, that it has hitherto
been impossible to fmd any law for them, but which, by this
very irregularity, appear to announce that they are not the
effect of an uniform and constant cause? According to this idea,
nothing in Europe would oblige the compass to return towards
the east; and indeed, since it has ceased to decline to the west, it
has not been observed to retrograde by any sensible quantity :
so that, according to the observations hitherto made, it is im
possible to decide whether it will ever return or not.
    The magnetic action of the terrestrial globe is not confined
these   will act on eacli other, and gradually change the forces with which
they attract, and thereby influence the variation of the compass. This
action will however, in time, bring the whole to an equilibrium ; and as two
poles appear to be the natural and most simple state, to this it will always
have a tendency to return, although the internal changes that take place in
the bowels of the earth, arising from chemical causes, may frequently coun
teract and retard this operation.     The metallic substances which the earth
Contains near its surface are well known to be continually altering theif
nature: and if the variation of the compass depend at all upon the changes
of these substances, as is commonly supposed, it is evident, these changes
 take place much more rapidlv than is generally believed.
    * Father de la Torre observed in Italy, during the great eruption of
 MountVesnvius, that the variation was lo" in the morning; at noon it was
 14*; and in the evening it was 10', and it continued in that state till the
 lava grew so cold as no longer to emit any light in the night, after which it
 slowly increased to 13J degrees, where it remained.
    Daniel Bcrnouilli found the needle change its position 45' by an earth
 quake
    Professor Midler, at Manheim, observed also that the variation of the
 needle in that place was greatly affected by the earthquake in Calabria.
 Such streams of lava as flowed from Hecla in the last dreadful eruption,
 must have made a transference of magnetic matter that would considerably
 affect the needle : but no observations seem to have been made on the oc
  casion ; for we know that common iron-stone, which has no effect on the
 needle, will, by mere cementation with any inflammable substance, becon.e
  magnetic.    In this way Dr. Knight sometimes made artificial loadstones.

                                          ;
has been proved by Gay Lussac and myself, in an aerostatic
ascent.   It even appears, according to our observations, that
the intensity of this action decreases slowly in proportion as we
remove from the terrestrial surface ; for we did not find any
sensible diminution at the height to which we were elevated.
Probablv its diminution follows the general law of magnetic
actions; that is, the inverse ratio of the square of the distance*?
if so, it will extend indefinitely into space. Analogy leads us to
think that the moon, the sun, and the other celestial bodies,
are endowed with similar actions; and the more so, as the com
position of aeroliths that have fallen on our globe have shown
lis that the heavenly bodies contain, in like manner, magnetic
substances, such as nickel andiron-)".      The magnetic actions of
alL these bodies must, therefore, according to their positions and
distances, influence the direction of the magnetic needle on
the earth's surface, as well as the absolute intensity of the di
recting force: and as these positions and distances are con
tinually changing, by the effect of the motion of the earth
and of all the planets, it must follow that there will also be per
petual alterations in the magnetic forces.       For example : If the
magnetic    action  of the sun and of the moon be sensible, the
motion of rotation of the earth round itself, and its motion of
revolution round the sun, must produce diurnal and annual os
cillations in the magnetic needle. Now, not only do such mo
tions exist, but their periods, having been established by a long-
series of observations, agree with the cause which we have just
pointed out. At Paris, according to M. Cassini, the maximum-
of the diurnal variation X appears to take place between noon and
three in the afternoon; then the needle becomes stationary; it then,
approaches towards the terrestrial meridian, until about eight in
the evening; then it stops, and remains stationary during the
whole of the night.      But in the morning, about eight, it begins
again to recede from the meridian.        If this second motion re
                                                                      move
   * This wns the law of
                          magnetic attraction discovered by Coulomb ; but
Dr. Brook Taylor found by experiments which he made to ascertain          it,
that at small distances   itwas nearly-in the inverse ratio of the square of
the distance: and further off   it was inversely as the cube of the distance,
or even more than that.  Phil. Transactions, vol. xxix.
f    Itis here supposed   that these stones come to us from some of the
heavenly bodies, which has not yet been proved.
 t   The diurnal variation was first observed by Mr. George Graham in
March, April, and May 1722, and published in the Transactions of the
Royal Society, No. 383. The greatest variation westward which he found
was 14' 45', and the least 13" 5C,        mean of about 1000 observations.

move   it further than the evening before, it follows that the va
riation              from one day to the next; if the contrary,
          is increasing
it is decreasing.  The greatest diurnal variations generally take
place -during the months of April, May, June, and July; that is
to say, between the two equinoxes of spring and autumn.     They
are at Paris from 13 to 16 minutes.     The least are from 8 to
 10 minutes, and they take place during the remainder of the
year.   Now, if we compare the analogous positions of the needle
on different days, but at the same hours, in order to have its
general progress, we find that, from the spring equinox to the
following summer solstice, the variation is decreasing ; and that
it is increasing all the rest of the year, that     from the sum        is,
mer solstice to the following spring equinox (as       represented            is
in fig. 4). For our knowledge of these periods we are indebted
to M. Cassini, who has established them         observations made by
during eight years   at the Observatory at Paris.
    Lastly numerous observations prove that the magnetic needle
           ;
is subject to sudden and accidental alterations, which depend on
the appearance of those luminous meteors called aurorce bo-

   Mr. Canton attempts to account for these changes             observing thatby
the force of magnet

                              is                  A small magnet being placed

from the natural position, the magnet was covered with a brass vessel, into
which hot water was poured. The needle gradually receded from the
magnet 3-4ths of a degree, and returned gradually to its place, as the water
cooled.   The parts of the earth to the eastward aie first hiated in the
morning, and therefore the magnetic force of the earth          weakened, and is
the needle   ismade to move to the westward but as the sun warms the

western side of the earth        the afternoon, the needle must move
                                    in                                   a con               in
trary direction.    iEpinus supposes that the sun acts on the earth as a mag
net acts on    piece of soft iron and in the morning propels the fluid into
               a                              ;
the N.W. parts        The needle directs itself to this constipated fluid, and
therefore  it points to the eastward of the magnetic north m the lfternoon.
Neither of these explanations will account for the great diversity of the,
diurnal variations in different places, which are so great, that Professor
Robison thinks, we can hardly ascribe the diurnal variation to any change
in  the magnetism of the primitive terrestrial magnet, and must rather
look for its cause   in local circumstances.

reales*.       The absolute      cause of this correspondence      between
them is      unknown, as well as that of the aurora lorealis itself.
The influence of this meteor on the needle, is commonly of short
continuance ; for, after being quickly agitated as long as this
manifests itself, the needle then returns to its usual position, and
proceeds again in the accustomed order of its motions : but it
also happens occasionally that it experiences a durable removal
from its place, some instances of which have been observed by
 M. Cassini.
     To measure these variations, whether diurnal or annual, Cou
 lomb used a steel needle, suspended to an assemblage of single
 filaments of silk as taken from the natural investment of the silk
 worm, and just sufficient to support it. At the two extremities
 of the needle he fixed two metal arcs, carrying very fine circular
 divisions.      The whole apparatus was inclosed in a box glazed
 above, in order that the needle might be observed without being
 agitated by currents of air.        Two microscopes fixed on the box,
 and furnished with hair micrometers, could each be directed
  to the divided arcs carried by the needle, and thus showed its
 smallest motions.         M. de Prony used for the same purpose a
 long magnetic needle, carrying on its length a telescope which
 moved with it ; the motion of which was observed on a distant
 mark. M. Humboldt, who made a number of observations with
 this apparatus, considers it very exaet.
      It is important, for the future progress of natural philosophy,
 that we should determine with accuracy the present intensity of
  terrestrial magnetism, in the same manner as the weight of the
  atmosphere and the actual temperature of different climates have
  beeii^ ascertained.       By repeating the same observations after
  some centuries, it would be known whether the magnetic force
  varies in its energy, at it is certain it has varied in its two di
  rections.
      The first method which presents itself to the mind, is to observe
  the variation, the dip, and the intensity, immediately, by means
  of three needles appropriated to this purpose, and then to pre
  serve them carefully for further trials from time to time. As they
  are liable to lose their magnetism in this interval, they might be
  restored to the same state by a fresh process, using for this pur
  pose bars well combined together, according to the method of
     *  " The aurora boreulis is observed in Europe to disturb the needle ex
   ceedingly; sometimes drawing it several degrees from its position.     It is
   always found to increase its deviation f rom the meridian, and makes the
   needle point more westerly.    This disturbance sometimes amounts to six or
  seven degrees, and is generally observed to be greatest when the aurora
   horenlis is most remarkable.    No needie but a magnetic one is affected by
   the uurora borealis ; we may therefore conclude that there is some natural
   connexion between this meteor and magnetism."-- Robkon.

the double touch*.        Indeed, in the application of this process,
the needles, by the influence of the extreme bars, are brought
instantaneously to a much stronger degree of magnetism than
that which they could preserve when they are lefi to themselves;
so that, if their internal constitution remain the same, the de
gree of magnetism .in which they are fixed must also remain
the same, or at least can only experience that degree of altera
tion which arises from a change of intensity in the magnetic
force of the globe.      This method might be rendered much more
certain by keeping thus a stated number of well tried needles,
the separate effects of which might be ascertained at any pre
vious stated epoch.        For      if,
                                   -in trying them again at any other
time,  it   should be found that they have preserved among them
their original properties, we might conclude with certainty that
they have not been altered in their constitution, and consequently
the observation of their absolute energies would determine the
real state of the magnetic force.
    But the adoption of this method requires the preservation of
the needles, and the assurance -of their identity.               This care
might    be  dispensed  with,    we
                                  if could   find  a method of  fabricating
two needles capable of being accurately compared together at
any time.       For this purpose we must not think of employing
steel, which, being    a   mixture of carbon and iron,          necessarily
                                                               is
variable in its proportions.       But this defect might be supplied,
if  we could procure some wire of perfectly pure soft iron             che  by
mical means.       For, according     to  the   experiments  of  Coulomb,
which we have already mentioned, twisting gives such                 degree
                                                                        a
 of density and elasticity to iron, that       it takes magnetism nearly
as well as steel, and retains          equally as long:
                                          it              it   is,
                                                                 therefore,
only necessary to regulate the quantity of twisting.             Now, this
is easily done   by   taking wires of an assigned length and size,
 and measuring the number of turns which they are twisted                         by
 means of a micrometer.       Each of these wires should then be mag
netized to saturation, and certain number of them should be col
                                  a
lected together, so as to form       bundle, the directing force of which
should be measured, either             by a
                                     a magnetic balance or          by
                                                                   the me
 thod of oscillations.     All the difficulty  is thus reduced to the pro
curing of pure iron, and this difficulty belongs solely to chemistry.
    If in any given place piece of soft iron, such as key for
                                  a                                  a

presently acquires two poles, which act on the magnetic needle
in  contrary directions.       Turn the key about, and its poles will
change, and the      same   effect may be reproduced.

  XXV. Answer to Mr. John Farey Sen. and              to  Dr. John
                  Murray. By J. Murray, Esq.
                          To   Mr.  Tilloch.
          M    Y name being introduced by Mr.' John Farey senior,
and Dr. John Murray, in your last number, I am peremptorily
called upon for an early reply.  That answer is now submitted.
    A contest regarding the priority of an invention may certainly
be carried on without asperity, for the object is merely to ascer
tain a fact ; and it is equally obvious that few would be found so
silly as to wish to have the merit of inventing a thing of no use.
Mr. Farey has nothing to do with this contest : his is of a dif
ferent kind.     He aims at inducing the neglect, the disuse, and
the contempt of the invention of the safety-lamp.       Now if others
could with him believe it useless, and be brought to consider it
not merely as a matter of indifference, but as criminal, to defend
Unen from the danger of being destroyed by explosions of fire
damp, they might then talk of it with much composure.                But
others do not take the same view of it as Mr. Farey, and he of
all men has the least right to complain if the charges which
he brings against others should, sometimes, be met by terms
which ought not to appear in the nicely-balanced language of
courtesy- I am unconscious of having offended Mr. Longmire. If
 I have, I entreat his forgiveness. The good and generous mind
will impute it to an honest warmth in favour of a discovery the
most important that has ever risen upon the horizon of existence:
and when I consider " what it has done for thousands," Iam,
absorbed and lost in the contemplation.          I may be called an
enthusiast: Indeed I am  I assume not the character of a man
 of science : but 1 trust Mr. Farey senior will not deny me the
appellation of a philosopher.    I shall be content to follow (though
 at an immeasurable distance between) onward in that path of
research which has been illuminated by the discoveries of Sir
 H. Davy.
    The recommendation of an occasional use of the safe-lamp
 is one which will not be followed; nor can I conceive any thing
more absurd or ridiculous than to employ the instrument
 on a Monday, and then hang it up the week through.                  The
 fatal effects of such a procedure have been recently awfully ex
 emplified in the last colliery which I descended.          I entieated
 Mr. Roscoe to the continued use of Sir H. Davy's safe-lamp  to
be uniform and universal.       The neglect of the precaution has
 accelerated that event which I hope will be a fence against any
 impressions from the doctrines of Mr. Farey senior. Sir H. Davy's
                                                                   lamp

  Answer to    Mr. John Farey   Sen. and to Dr. John Murray,    105
lamp was used in the Bagilt colliery, and some were ordered from
Mr. Newman of Lisle-street, by Mr. Roscoe, to whom I submitted
Mr. N.'s address ; but such has been either only occasional, or
used in such parts of the mine as were too alarming to be disre
garded.     I would not for a moment be understood to impeach
either the prudence or precaution of Mr. Edward Roscoe, whose
attention and care are highly honourable to him.
    Mr. Farey senior cannot say I took him by surprise in the letter
inserted in " The Carlisle Patriot," as I dispatched to him the
paper which contained it.      For what purpose he has kept it out
of sight for about a twelvemonth, I cannot even conjecture ; nor
can I divine for what end it is now introduced.           I may here
state, that at this period I had not seen Sir H. Davy's safe-lamp,
nor was aware of the extent of its application.       It was then in
infancy, and I only obtained a confused and indistinct idea of
its structure and properties through the medium of the press ; but
when I received one, and passed it through explosive atmospheres,
and saw its simplicity and its efficacy, and proved its " mighti
ness," I became a convert, and believed.      All other lamps asso
ciated with this, notwithstanding Dr. Murray's self-complacent
opinion, are bubbles in the comparison-  " Hyperion to a satyr."
Mr. Farey's latter paragraph is pitiful, very pitiful.
   Dr. John Murray commences his paper with observing, that
I was not aware of its being taken from The Transactions of the
Royal Society of Edinburgh.       There is nothing to warrant this
conclusion  I questioned the propriety of making this a leading
article in the Annals of Philosophy ; and as for the violence of
fered to Dr. John Murray, judge ye :  In reply to the article in
the " Edinburgh Star," I explained and gave in answer a satis
factory rejoinder.    In concluding, I remarked  " It must be evi
dent that the Doctor, feeling himself anticipated, is sore upon the
subject.    This is the punctum saliens." Such is the violence
I have done to the person and character of Dr. Murray! Con
fident that my reply was most conclusive, Dr. J. Murray antici
pates in his paper an answer; but he excuses himself from no
ticing it. This is an easy way of getting rid of his dilemma. Why
does Dr. Murray confine himself to remarks respecting the struc
ture of the chimney, which I admit in the first case was not so
simple a3 that afterwards adopted, and described in your last
number?       The other suggestions are quite independent of the
question, and have nothing to do whatever with the position, te A
lamp might be made air-tight and fed by a flexible tube from
the floor of the mine ; the carburetted hydrogen being lighter and
ascending would occupy the upper part, and thus could not enter
the tube."     And yet, with this language before him, he affectt

 damp, to be fcd by air contiguous to the floor of the mine ;  and
 directs his objections against the other suggestions, that are
 insulated and unconnected.            It is strange that every other per
 son who reads the paragraph cedes the priority to me. And
 though Dr. Murray may accuse Sir H. Davy and the Rev. Mr.
 Hodgson of collusion  Psha! psha! he surely cannot apply this
 to Mr. Knight and Phiialethes in your last number, who hap
 pen to be of the same opinion.                Respecting the other pro
 positions, which the Doctor pronounces untenable, because not
 sufficiently explanatory, I shall prove to your decided convic
 tion in a future number, that they are founded on well-known
 hvdro-pneumatie        laws; meantime this distinct feature belongs
 not to our question.           1 do not comprehend      what Dr. Murray
 means by the expression " all that I was called on to do."             For
 my own part, I was a volunteer in the cause            of humanity, and I
 atn sure Sir H. Davy was.            Dr. J. Murray observes, that " the
 plan in all its extent is preferable to any that has yet been brought
 forward."      Really this is too bad.
    Let me honestly assure Mr. Knight that I do not claim, nor
 have I claimed, the priority of constructing a lamp on the prin
 ciple of a diminished atmosphere.               God forbid that I should
 he thought possessed of the wish to rob Sir H. Davy of a single
 leaf of the wreath of which he is the wearer!              No: I shall re
joice   to see it flourish   :   I'd

 Heaven itself will smile upon and consecrate it.              His last in
 teresting discovery     is justly entitled to the appellation to xaXov,
 or the beautiful.
    Nobly as Sir Humphry Davy has served the sacred cause of
 humanity, and brilliant as have been his discoveries, I must ex
 press it as matter of astonishment and regret that no public testi
 mony of national gratitude has been voted him.                As a citizen
 of the world, and appreciating the talents of the distinguished
 individual who has unfolded {' the portals of worlds unknown,"
 I would humbly propose that the friends and admirers of Sir
 H. Davy should award some acknowledgement expressive of
 their gratitude and esteem, and to commemorate in a lively and
 lasting manner how highly they honour true taste and feeling
 when properly directed, and how much they value those ex
 alted talents by which the lives of myriads of human beings
 are protected and saved from destruction  a scene at which my
 hest feelings glow even in anticipation, and when only discerned
 through the valley of those shadows which bound the prospect

will be honestly and cheerfully bestowed.
    I hope it will not be said that the question rests with the pro
prietors of coal-mines.          This narrow and contemptible idea can
only   be entertained      by those  whose puerile and contracted views
are mean and despicable.             On the great and glorious cause
in question, there can be but one voice.             Let it be expressed,

honour and sanction it.  I fondly trust the suggestion will not
be despised because it emanates from so humble an individual
as myself.       I feel somewhat gratified that, touched with the
 awful recital of the destruction of human beings, I was among the
earliest in the field ;  and when the distinctions of fortune shall
 sink into oblivion, the name of Davy shall live, and be associated

 Sir,  "Y'ou        have several times favoured me by inserting in
 your   valuable    Magazine     the results of experiments I have made
 on various substances, exhibiting effects very different from what
 would be suggested by mere theoretical speculation.
     I now wish particularly to call the attention of your readers
 to the combination of copper with iron, which, although stated
                                                                        by

by many writers on metallurgy              to be capable of uniting in an
indirect way, is yet by           most   operative men, as casters of cop*
per, and others, positively denied to have any such capacity.
    I have had my attention directed to this subject, by being
summoned as an evidence in a cause Smith v. Frost.                     Mr.
Smith, who uses copper pans to boil the ingredients for making
a green pigment for painting and dyeing, had been recommended
to make use of east pans, to save the expense of wrought ones; but
these not answering his purpose, he employed me to inspect and
give my opinion on them.                In my experiments I proved the
presence     of tin  and  iron  ;  the  latter was in a very minute quan
 tity: but from the proportion of the former the contract was
 supposed to be void.         The opposite party however, being cop-
 per-smiths or casters, positively asserted the impossibility of
 the union of copper and iron. And finding, on inquiring of se
veral persons in the same way of business, that a similar opinion
generally prevailed, I resolved on making some experiments to
prove how far it was possible to unite these metals.
    I first mixed 100 parts of copper with two of iron, covering
them with rosin and filling the crucible with powdered charcoal,
After being exposed to about 90" of Wedgwood's thermometer
for a quarter of an hour, the mixture gave a clean lump of copper
not quite so malleable as when unadulterated, and with a redder
grain. I then endeavoured to ascertain how much iron the cop
per would take up, by covering 400 grains of pure copper with
iron filings, and filling the crucible as before. The produce was
 SS0 grahjs, of a large red grain, bubbled in the inside as if occa-t
sioned by confined air, with a clean uneven surface, and possess
ing nearly the malleability of zinc.
    The next thing was to prove the existence of the iron by the
usual process of analysis.          The increased weight, indeed, clearlv
proved     its  presence   ;  but   I  thought the analysis necessary, to
prove    that   only  the  iron   had   entered into the composition.   A$
the iron I had used for the foregoing experiments was slightly
oxidated, I fancied this might have facilitated the union.                I
therefore subjected 400 grains of copper covered with black
oxide of iron (the crucible filled with charcoal) to a strong de
gree of heat for half an hour. The produce was 526 grains of
copper remarkably red, which on analysis nearly answered to
the increased weight as metallic iron.              I consider the iron to
have been the cause of the copper having such a red appearance,
from its partially oxidating it : it may perhaps, too, have had
the effect ot making it more brittle, by separating the particles,
of metallic copper. I further ascertained that this oxidation
greatly facilitated the combination.            Having melted 400 grains
of pure copper, with a clean bit of thick iron wire, taking care
                                                                        tq

               On the Union    of Copper with Iron, (Sc.            109
to cover the crucible well, as in the former experiments ; the
produce was a lump of copper, in the heart of which a bead of
steel (containing a proportion of copper) was found inclosed,
with some loose bits of steel, on the surface of which a few grains
of bad copper were to be perceived. The copper was very mal
leable, but not so much so as when unadulterated, and containing
only 4y per cent, of iron.
     The formation of the steel may of course be accounted for by
the crucible being filled with charcoal, to prevent the oxidation
 of the copper.
     Although the union of these two metals is certainly not so
perfect as that of other metals, yet I trust that those who credit
these simple experiments will abandon the prejudice of there be
ing any impossibility in their combination.        For my own satis
 faction, I have made several experiments in uniting copper with
other metals ; and perhaps you may consider them sufficiently
interesting to give them also a place in your pages. What more
particularly struck my attention, was the effect of arsenic when
 melted with copper. It altered the colour without increasing the
 weight of the copper, being no doubt volatilized.
     United with two hundredth parts of arsenic, the copper was
 rendered whiter, softer, and more ductile, but not increased in
weight. United with ten hundredth parts of arsenic, the copper,
 as in the former case, was not increased in weight, but became
 very white, and not quite so malleable.
     It may be necessary however to observe, that I used the glas«
 or oxide of arsenic, which might have facilitated its evolution; al
 though, as the crucibles were filled with charcoal dust, I thought
 this would have prevented any such effect.
     Copper united with two hundredth parts of tin was rendered
 less malleable, became of a flaky bright when suddenly flattened
 by hammering, was smooth in the fracture, and had a colour in
 clining to yellow, and somewhat whitened.
     Copper united with two hundredth parts of lead assumed a
 bright flaky appearance when hammered, and the malleability
  was much diminished.
     Copper united with two hundredth parts of zinc was rendered
 softer and less ductile, but not so flaky as when united with
  either tin or lead : the fracture was of a dirty- red colour.
     I shall shortly have the pleasure of submitting to your notice
  the result of my experiments on the combination of some other
  metals.    I remain

 have been made for its alleviation.      The conical form of th»
 cornea has been attributed to an over-distention of that tunic,
 occasioned bv a superabundant secretion of the aqueous humour,
 which continually stretching the cornea, has gradually occasioned
it to yield to the pressure from within, and thus produced the
 alteration in its form.   To remove this supposed over- distention,
 it has been usually recommended to evacuate the aqueous hu
mour, by puncturing the cornea, and afterwards to employ
pressure, astringent collyria, &c. to prevent its reaccumulation.
Experience     has, however, shown the total inutility of these
modes of practice. The operation of evacuating the aqueous hu
mour has been, in some instances, repeated several times, with
out any permanent advantage being found to result from it ; and
 although it is an operation neither painful nor difficult to per
form, yet it is sometimes dangerous ; for if the crystalline lens
should be wounded by the instrument with which the puncture
is made, cataract will most likely ensue ; and I have been in
formed of a case, where this actually occurred, during the at
tempt to evacuate the aqueous humour.
     Having, at an early period of my practice, been impressed
with the opinion, that the conical form assumed by the cornea
in this disease, was the effect of a morbid growth of that tunic;
and that the short-sight experienced by the patient, was to be
attributed to its increased refractive power, which, together with
that of the crystalline lens, brought the rays of light to a point
far short of the retina, it occurred to me, that as it was impossi
ble to remove the morbid growth of the cornea, without ren
dering it unfit for the transmission of light, a useful degree of
vision might be restored by the removal of the crystalline lens. I
was the more strongly led to form this conclusion, after having
myself tried the experiment of looking through deep convex
spectacles, such as are employed by patients after the removal
of cataract, which, I found, produced a confusion of sight, very
similar to that which I had heard described by persons in whom
the cornea had been conical in the extreme degree.       I therefore
resolved, more than six years since, while surgeon to the West
of England Eye Infirmary, instituted at Exeter, to remove the
crystalline lens in a case in which that body had become opake,
and also affected with conical cornea.       Some circumstances,
however, prevented the patient, who was a young woman, and
a pauper, from being sent to me to the Infirmary.       About three
years since, another patient, from the country, an old woman,
nearly seventy years of age, placed herself under my care, la
bouring under this disease, accompanied with cataracts, in whom
I successfully removed both the cataracts, and had the gratifi
cation to find her vision thereby restored to an extent which far
                                                          surpassed

                   On     the Restoration  of Vision.             1    13
surpassed my most sanguine        expectations.    I observedthat she
was capable of seeing much more distinctly without convex
glasses than is usual for persons who have undergone the opera
tion for cataract, while, with a convex glass, she could read small
print without any difficulty.    Not being able to ascertain the de
gree of vision which this patient experienced previously to the
removal of the cataracts, nor whether the diseased change had
been going on in the cornea and crystalline lens at the same
time, I necessarily cannot state the exact amount of the benefit
which she derived from the operation.        This, however, was de
monstrated  that, by the removal of the crystalline lens in eyes
affected with conical cornea, nearly perfect vision was restored ;
while it is well known that, in cases of conical cornea where no
cataracts exist, vision is usually as imperfect as if the latter ma- .
lady formed a part of the patient's disease.
   The favourable result of this operation fully confirming the
opinion which induced me to perform           it,
                                                I  determined at the
earliest opportunity to try the effect of removing an healthy
crystalline lens, as  a remedy for blindness produced        byconical
cornea.   A    favourable case presented itself the following year,
in a young woman, who, during six years, found her sight gra
dually decreasing, and, at the expiration of that period, had be
come so blind, from this disease, as to be unable to continue her
employment as     a   servant, and was in consequence obliged to
 apply for parochial maintenance.        Shortly afierwards she was
sent to an Eye Infirmary in London, where receiving no benefit,
she was subsequently brought to me, and solicited in the most
urgent terms the trial of any practice, which afforded       prospect
                                                             a
 of restoring her to sight.   I  carefully examined her eyes, and
 found that the cornea of both eyes had assumed the conical form
 in a great degree, attended by      a slight opacity in the apex of
 each cone, but none whatever in the crystalline lens.     She could
walk without guide, and could see at three or four feet distance,
              a
 so as to avoid running against any person, but had entirely lost
the power of reading, or perceiving minute objects, however
 nearly they were placed to the eyes.
 I    effected the removal of the crystalline lens, by causing    itto
 be absorbed, which method of operating         isto be preferred to
 every other hitherto practised, whether the lens be opake or not,
 in cases where, like the present, admits of being freely divided.

 The patient, however, returned to the country before the eye
 had entirely recovered from the operation, and      Idid not see her
 again until nearly twelve months afterwards, when       Iwas in the
 highest degree gratified to find her capable of discovering minute
 objects, and reading the smallest-sized print, without the assist
 ance of glass, while holding the hook at the usual distance of

ten or twelve inches from the eye, nearly as well as she ever re
collects to have done.      The usual cataract spectacles for near
objects,   of two inches  and a half focus, confused her sight nearly
in the same manner     as  before the crystalline lens was removed,
while with those of nine or ten inch foci, her capability of seeing
minute objects was somewhat improved.             She saw objects at a
distance better without than with any glass I could find ; whereas
the usual standard for distant vision, after the operation for ca
taract, is four inches focus.     She now neither uses a glass for
near nor distant objects, has again returned to service ; and a
gentleman told me, who has recently seen her, that she accu
rately described to him an object which was considerably more
than a quarter of a mile distant.       Twelve months after under
going this operation, I operated upon the other eye ; but she
again left town before the eye had recovered itself, and before
the lens was entirely absorbed.       Previously, however, to her de
parture, she could read small print with this eye, by the assist
ance of a convex glass of two and three quarters inches focus,
while with one of nine inches focus the sight was greatly im
 proved in viewing distant objects.
    As the degree of conical form of the cornea appeared to he
the same in both eyes, and as the patient was equally blind in
both eves before the operations, it is a curious circumstance, and
 deserving notice, that the two eyes should require glasses dif
 fering so much in their refractive power.           Not being able to
 obtain any other information from the patient as to the pro
gressive amendment of her vision, during the twelve months she
 remained in the country, between February 1815 and February
 1816, when she underwent the operation upon the second eye,
 except "that her sight continued to get stronger," (an indefinite
 mode of expression made use of by poor people in their recovery
 from almost every species of diseased eye,) I cannot undertake
 to afford any authentic data for the hypothesis which I venture
 to offer as an explanation of this phenomenon.
     It appears to me that the greater degree of improvement of
 vision in the eye first operated upon, might be occasioned by
 the increased susceptibility of the retina from the exercise of that
  organ, and the power the eye had acquired of adapting itself to
  see near and distant objects distinctly,      during the interval of
  twelve months the patient was absent ; whereas the trial with
  the two and three quarters convex glass for near objects, and
  nine for distant one6, on the eye last operated upon, was made
  only a few weeks after the operation, and even before the atten
  dant inflammatory action had subsided, or the whole of the lens
  become absorbed.       I am led to adopt these opinions from ob
  servations made in numerous instances upon persons who have
                                                           successfully

successfully undergone the operation for cataract, and who al
most uniformly require deeper convex glasses to see distinctly
immediately subsequent to the operation, than are necessary af
terwards.     That the retina and optic nerve become partially in
sensible from not being exercised, and reacquire their natural
susceptibility when again brought into use, are facts which I
have so often witnessed, that I judged them sufficiently con
firmed to insert them in my practical observations on diseases of
the eye; and I have also generally observed, more particularly
in poor persons, who from the inconvenience attached to wearing
spectacles, appear to feel an objection to their use, that although
they are unable to see either near or distant objects immediately
after the operation, without glasses, yet, after a time, they ac
quire the power to a considerable degree of perfection, if they
have the patience to do without them.       I cannot elucidate these
opinions better, than by instancing three cases which have oc
curred .in the extensive opportunities I have had of making si
milar observations among the patients on whom I have operated
for the cataract.
    The first was a postillion who had been blind nine years in one
eye, and three in the other.       Both cataracts were successfully
removed by the operation effecting their absorption, and when
he resumed his employment as a postillion, he was, from neces
sity, obliged to wear his spectacles, not being able even to walk
without them ; but finding that his passengers were frequently
apprehensive of their safety, from being driven by a person re
quiring spectacles, he by degrees left them off altogether in the
day, and in the course of twelve months he could drive quite as
well without as with them.       At night, however, when the rays
of light being comparatively    few  in number, require the most
complete concentration upon the retina, to produce a sufficient
impression upon that membrane for the purposes of vision, he
still derived great advantage from the use of distant sight spec
tacles.    The poor fellow died of pleurisy about two years after
the removal of the cataracts.     Had he lived, it is probable the
susceptibility of the retina would have so far increased, and the
adjustive powers of the eye so much improved, that he would
have seen even at night, sufficiently well without the use of any
glasses.
    While at Exeter I effected the removal of cataracts in a young
man twenty years of age, who was born with them.            The ca
taracts were originally fluid, but, as is usually the case when this
species is suffered to remain for any long period without being
operated upon, the fluid part had become absorbed, leaving no
thing but an opake capsule containing the grosser parts of the
cataract.    With the right eye he could see brilliant colours, and

perceive light from darkness, but could not discriminate any ob
ject    ; with the left I found him capable of seeing objects at a
 distance indistinctly, and of distinguishing large-sized letters
 when held in an oblique direction within two inches of his eyes,
 and with his back turned to the light.        If, however, he attempted
 to read facing the light, he entirely lost this power : and un
 der the most favourable circumstances, the sphere of vision was
 so circumscribed, that it did not include above three or four let
 ters at a time.       To my surprise, as soon as the eye had recovered
 from the operation, he was able, without spectacles, to see both
 near and distant objects with a degree of precision quite unusual
 without their aid.        He returned home at the end of ten weeks
  (a  fortnight   only  after a second operation, which was performed
 on    one  eye), and   I did  not again see him for about nine months,
 when I found him capable of reading and writing with both eyes,
 without the assistance of glasses, although with one of them he
 had never, previous to the operation, been able to discern objects
 from his birth.
      I now engaged him as a footman, being perfectly competent
 to execute the usual duties attached to this station, except to
judge accurately of distances ; he could not at this time snuff a
 candle with certainty, or pour liquids into a small glass.           He
 neither used spectacles to see near or distant objects by night or
 day, but he always held small ones more than usually near to his
 eyes when he wished to view them attentively; in doing which he
 knit his brows, and appeared strongly to exert the powers of the
 eye.      He saw, to all appearance, at as great a distance as any
 other person, and was fond of viewing extensive prospects. The
 scenery about the Irish and Scottish lakes seemed to delight
 hiin exceedingly.        Finding him however incorrigibly idle and
 inattentive, I was obliged to discharge him at the end of the first
 year, when his knowledge of distances was so much improved,
 that in the service where he afterwards lived in the country, he
  for some time acted as coachman.
      Two very extraordinary facts occurred in this case : first, the
  patient's immediate capability of adjusting his eyes in viewing
  different distances ; secondly, his having so soon established the
  susceptibility of the retina of that eye in which he had not seen
  previously to the operation.        The first may, I think, be satis
  factorily explained by supposing that in his best eye, the power
  of adaptation had been acquired previously to the performance
  of the operation ; for the crystalline lens having been opake, and
  nearly absorbed, was not only useless in effecting the natural re
   fraction of the rays of light but also actually impeded them in
   their progress to the retina, the only passage by which they
  could make their way to the bottom of the eye, being through

                      On the Restoration    of Vision.                  117
 the edge of the capsule, where it was less opake than in its cen
 tre.   In the passage of the rays of light through this portion of
 the capsule, it is evident, very little, if any refraction, could take
place, and it therefore required the adjusting powers of the eye
 to be exercised in order to enable him to see near and distant
 objects previous to the operation, quite as much, if not more
 than if the lens had been actually removed.
    Thus, then, that power which usually takes a patient six or
twelve months to acquire after the removal of the lens in ordi
nary cases, was possessed in this previously to the performance
of the operation.
    The small space at the edge of the capsule, through which
alone the light was capable of making its way to the retina, ex
plains the necessity of the patient turning his back to the light
in order to effect a dilatation of the pupil ; for when he faced
the light, from the contraction of the pupil, the iris covering the
greater part of the space in the capsule through which the light
passed, necessarily occasioned a still greater diminution of vision
than he previously experienced.
    The same cause accounts also for his being obliged to hold
small objects in an oblique direction, and for his seeing but three
or four letters at a time ; for had the part of the capsule through
which the light passed, been in the centre instead of at the edge,
and also been of a large extent instead of being confined, he
would consequently have seen objects straight forwards, and have
possessed the power of taking in a much larger extent of vision.
The opinion that the latter effect was occasioned by the small
space through which the light had to pass, is confirmed by my
having generallv observed, that where the pupil is naturally
small, the field of vision is proportionally circumscribed.        In one
instance of a patient who came to me after he had undergone
a number of operations for cataract, in a public institution, I
found the pupil so much contracted as to render it dangerous for
him to walk in the streets by day, and entirely to incapacitate
him from doing so alone, at night. After forming an artificial
pupil of a proper size, he was enabled to see even the nails of his
fingers when the arms were extended to the utmost at right an
gles with the body, nearly as distinctly as he could before I
operated upon him, when placed immediately before his eye, and
he now sees to walk at night as well as other persons*.
    With respect to that eye of my late servant with which he had
never seen previous to the operation, and the retina of which so
quickly acquired its susceptibility, it certainly was a very unusual
circumstance ; for, as I have already observed, and as will be
      * See Plate II. and case 10. in my work on Diseases of the Eye.
                                     H 3                              fully

fully exemplified    in the third case detailed, it in general re
quires    a considerable  time to restore by exercise the want of
sensibility  occasioned  by its having been long dormant.
    I have, however, lately seen another similar instance in a young
man thirty years of age, born with cataracts : with one eye, as
in the above case, he never had seen more than to distinguish
 brilliant colours, and perceive light from darkness. The frag
ments of the cataract having spontaneously become depressed
immediately on its being divided, he instantly saw light much more
strongly than he had done before ; on the following day he saw
 all the objects around him, and at the expiration of a fortnight,
when the eye had recovered itself, he could, with the assistance
 of glasses, distinctly discriminate the minutest objects, even the
second and minute marks on my watch dial.
    The third case is entirely opposite in its bearing to the two
former.     About seven years since, I operated upon a young gen
tleman born with partial cataracts.        The centre of the crystal
line lens was opake in both eyes, but the circumference in each
was transparent, which afforded him an indistinct but very use
ful vision, he being able to read small Greek character, and to
see distant objects, although not as far or as distinct as other
people, yet sufficiently for general use.      I removed the whole of
the  lens by  the operation for  absorption,  when  with the assistance
 of properly adjusted glasses, he saw with his best eye both near
and distant objects to the utmost extent of his expectations and
wishes ; with the other, the retina of which had become insensi
ble from never having been in the habit of exercising        it,
                                                              he could
see but very little.    After the operation he habituated himself
constantly to use spectacles for distant as well as for near ob
jects, and he is    now at the end of seven years unable to avoid
 running against persons, or the furniture of          room,
                                                         a     ifhe at
 tempts to cross    itwithout them ;    whereas, with spectacles, he
sees sufficiently to have become an- expert shotsman.            There
 can be no doubt that the inability of this gentleman to see ob
jects, has arisen from his not bringing the adjusting powers of
 the organ into action, in consequence of habitually using his two
 kinds of spectacles which effected the necessary refraction of the
 rays of light to see both near and distant objects, without oc
casioning any exertion of the eye whereas;           ifhe had felt the
same necessity of doing without them soon after the operation,
 as described in   the case of the postillion, he would unquestion
ably   have  succeeded   equally well.   It   also evident that
                                              is                    by
                                                                    the
removal of the crystalline lens, he lost the power which he pre
viously possessed, of adjusting his eyes to different distances,         al
though their partial opacity prevented his seeing either near or
jdjstant objects as well as other persons, and which power, owing

                       On the Restoration   of Vision.              119
to the habitual   use of convex glasses, of 2| or 2| for near, and
4 or 4{ for distant objects, he has irot since reacquired.
    From a consideration of these three cases, am I not then jus
tified in hazarding the conclusion, that whatever power the cry
stalline lens possesses of adjusting the eye to different distances,
yet, after its removal, there is another power of adjustment,
which (as in the former cases) can be subsequently brought into
action by exercising the organ without glasses, but which power
(as in the latter) is not called into action when glasses are con
tinually employed ?  I have myself full confidence in this opinion,
having, after the removal of the crystalline lens, almost uniformly
witnessed similar results from similar exercise of the eye.
    The partial insensibility of the retina before spoken of, as a
cause for the necessity of using a deeper convex glass soon after
the operation, for the purposes of vision, than is afterwards re
quired, cannot apply to the best eye of this gentleman, for to the
period of the operation he exercised it in the prosecution of his
studies ; while its necessity for the other, the retina of which
had become torpid for want of being exercised, was strikingly
exemplified, it being a considerable time after the operation, even
with the assistance of the deep convex glass, before this eye had
acquired any degree of useful vision.        At the present time its
powers are very inferior to the    other, from being less employed
in consequence of the patient's chiefly relying on his best eye.
    In returning to the consideration of the case detailed of the
young woman with the conical cornea; it may perhaps be sup
posed, that, by admitting the susceptibility of the retina to hava
been increased by its being twelve months exercised after the
operation, and the adjusting powers of the eye to have been ac
quired from the same cause, I abandon my opinion that tha
morbid degree of refraction of the light in its passage through
the thickened cornea,' together with the natural refraction pro
duced by the crystalline lens, were the cause of the confused and
imperfect vision previously experienced by the patient : this how
ever is not the case, as the fact of the girl being capable of seeing
after the removal of the lens, which was not in the slightest de
gree opake, after having been~blind previously, convinces me that
the refractive powers (the conical cornea and crystalline) were
 too powerful, and that the cure was effected by the removal of
one of them.      But what I conceive proves the accuracy of these
 inductions      is,
                 that in the earlier stages of the disease, when
 the thickening has not attained the height       had reached
                                                 it            in  the
 case alluded to, the greatest assistance    afforded to the patient's
                                            is
 vision     by
            the employment of concave glasses.
  It   is not, however, my intention to urge that the refractive
 power  is equally great in the thickened cornea as in the crystal-
                                  H   4                             line

120               On the Phcenomena       of Platinum
line lens ; on the contrary, I think that a convex glass of a less
magnifying power than that usually required after the removal of
cataract, may be frequently employed to great advantage in
cases of conical cornea.
    Were any further arguments than those adduced necessary to
prove that the short sight of the patient is occasioned by the
morbid thickness of the cornea, and not by the superabundant
quantity of the aqueous humour, as has been supposed, it would
be, the well-known fact, that water possesses little comparative
refractive power ; while, from the dense structure and the form
of the conical cornea, it is as evident that its powers of refraction
must be very considerably increased. Indeed, gulta serena would
certainly be produced by the backward pressure of a superabun
dant quantity of aqueous humour against the vitreous humour
and retina, long before it would occasion a protrusion of so dense
and firm a tunic as the transparent cornea ; and 1 have actually
seen gutta serena result from this cause, without any material
convexity of the cornea being perceptible, although from over-
distention it felt to the touch nearly as hard as an egg-shell.
    Although I may have failed in convincing my readers of the
 accuracy of some of the opinions which 1 have ventured to sub
mit in this paper, yet 1 have the gratification of knowing "that I
 have fully proved the important fact, of having successfully carried
into effect a mode of treatment capable of restoring vision in a
 case incurable by other surgical means, and which, as far as I
 have been able to ascertain, has hitherto never been employed
 by any other person.
 XXVIII.     On the Phcenomena      of Platinum and other Wires in
                         inflammable     Media.
                            To  Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,  Admiring,       as  I did, the important and beautiful com
 munication of Sir H. Davy on the Phenomena of Platinum Wire
 and that of Palladium in some inflammable Media, it may not
 be uninteresting for you to receive an account of my experiments.
 " Experimentum fiat " is the impression which will ever govern
 my philosophical studies: and seeing that the noblest erection of
 theory which the human mind can rear, must yield the prece
  dency to a single fact established by the hand of experiment, I
  shall in the present imposing march of chemical discovery be
 fearful of trusting to the illusions of fancy, and regard with a
 jealous eye the portraiture     drawn by the pencil of hypothetical
 dogma.
                                                             1. Plati-

               and other Wires in inflammable      Media.          121
1. Platinum wire continues red hot in explosive mixtures of in
    flammable gases.        Also in the vapour of naftha, alcohol
    and ether.      I found it in like manner effective in nitric, &c.
    ethers, as well as the sulphuric; in phosphorized ether and
     alcoholic solution of camphor ; oil of wine, vapour of sul-
    phuret of carbon, and of camphor.
2. I discovered that gold, silver, steel, and copper wires were
   phosphorescent, though they did not continue red hot in the
    vapour of ethers, oil of wine, and sulphuret of carbon.
3. Platinum wire and that of gold, silver, steel, and copper,
    when phosphorescent in the vapour of ethers and oil of wine,
    evolve a peculiar acrid acid gas, rendered sensible by the
    contiguity of a stopper moistened with ammonia.          This acid
    gas   acts violently on the eyes, exciting tears.
4. A glass rod and piece of the stem of a tobacco-pipe will, in the
    vapour of ethers and oil of wine, be phosphorescent; and
    in like manner contribute by this minimum combustion to
    the formation of the acid gas in question.         I need scarcely
    add that, prior to the introduction of the wires, &c. into
    the volatile inflammable medium, such should be made red
    hot.
 The phosphorescent flame is very livelily exhibited in intro
    ducing copper wire, &c. into phosphorized ether; and the pla
    tinum wire continues to glow very vividly over oil of wine,
    until the ethereal matter is all expended in the production of
    the acid gas, leaving a residuum, which seems to be a pecu
    liar fixed oil, combining with potassa and soda, and highly
    inflammable.       Spec. gr. less than that of water.
5. When gold wire entwines a coil of platinum wire, and the
    wires are heated and plunged into the ethereal medium, the
    platinum continues to glow red hot, and the gold wire will
    be seen dark among the threads of platinum.
6. The phosphorescent flame exhibited under the preceding cir
    cumstances I did not find susceptible of igniting either ole-
    fiant or coal gas, or phosphorized ether, sulphur, or sulphuret
    of carbon.       A jet of coal gas urged on platinum wire red
    hot, in oil of wine, &c. caused it to glow more vividly.         If
    the platinum wire be depressed lower than the focus, where
    the ignition is most intense, the phosphorescent flame will
    be displayed, and the platinum will cease to be red hot.  The
     display of phosphorescence may be repeated frequently, par
     ticularly with glass and alumina ; for at each successive im
     mersion jt will be renewed.      Two coils of platinum and steel
     wires in contact, both previously made red hot and plunged
     simultaneously into the vapour of ether, exhibit an inter
     esting appearance.      In the first instance the steel wire will
                                                              continue

   122                       Geological Queries,
       continue red hot, while the platinum is not luminous.          Oft
       the moment, however, the reverse takes place, and the plati
       num becomes luminous, while the iron wire instantly ceases
       to be so ; nor does the latter exhibit phosphorescence when
       the platinum glows.
                     I am very respectfully, sir,
                                 Your obedient humble servant,

     P. S.  I plunged the red hot platinum wire into the vapour
  of the following essential oils, but did not    succeed in maintaining
  it in this state  Origanum, nutmeg, lavender and cloves. In
  the vapour of sulphur I had a lambent phosphorescent flame.

     Appearances of Coal, cWc. in Lincolnshire.           By A Corre

                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,    The       extreme kindness and urbanity of your very able
 correspondent       Nathaniel John Winch, Esq. in replying, so
 promptly, in p. 100 of vol. xlvii, to the 5 queries which I had
 taken the liberty of proposing to him, in p. 12 of that volume,
 ought long ago to have received my grateful acknowledgements :
 but gathering from his replies, that the Geological Society were
 in possession of important communications from him, on the
 subjects of my inquiries, I have abstained from troubling him
 further; until now, when having read the 1st part of Vol. iv. of
 their Transactions, I am happy in being able, sincerely to thank
 and congratulate Mr. W. on having produced (near 3 years ago)
 beyond comparison the best Paper, for its copious and practi
 cally useful details, which that Society have yet laid before the
 public : accompanied at the same time by my regret, that the
 Society have not thought fit to include also in this part, another
 Paper, which I learn that Mr. W. has (more than 9 months
ago) presented to them, regarding the east part of Yorkshire.
    Mr. W.'s goodness, and zeal for the advancement of practi
cally useful Geology, will I trust excuse the liberty I am taking,
in again reviving, and considerably amplifying, some of the sub
jects of my Five Queries, in the page above referred to, viz.
     1st. Are not some of the lower individual seams of Coal, and
their floor and roof Measures, of Limestone, &c. which are
worked in the detached part of Durham and NE part of North
umberland, traceable, although perhaps varying much in thick
ness and quality, round the east and south flanks of the Cheviot
                                                                   mass

mass of strata, with corresponding dips, somewhere near to Roth-
bury ?, Bellingham ?, and thence W and NW, towards or into
 Cumberland     ?.
   Do not    some  of the Coal-seams, and their accompaniments,
which are wrought near the Coast, between the Coquet and
Wensbeck Rivers, range thence, varying perhaps in thickness,
somewhere near to Morpeth ?, Stamfordham ?, Hexham ?, Stu-
blic? and Alston-Moor?; and do [they not continue thence
through Teesdale Forest?, to near Staindrop ?, and become co
vered by the Magnetic Limestone ? ; And,, do not these same
measures, occupy part of the surface E and SE of Brough ?, and
in Arkengarth Forest?, &c.
    2nd. Is not the Basalt, ranging from Jemming or Timming, (or
Temon) to the Tyne River near Wall, and from West-Harle to
near Causway-Park, in reality a continuous stratum, with a
south-eastwardly dip ?.
    Are not the scattered patches of Basalt, between the Tyne and
West-Harle, in reality, either joined, by connecting, but thinner
parts of the same stratum, (and perhaps greatly varied in com
position and appearance also)? ; or, does the continuous bed of
Basalt alluded to, range on the SE of most of these patches of
Basalt, leaving them really detached," as Hummocks ?.
    Is there not a prolongation of the Basalt, traceable from Caus
way-Park eastward to the Coast ? : at least, do none of its nu
merous varieties appear, in situ (not as real dykes) on the shore,
or in the adjacent Islands, from Druridge to Red-Hill, near
 Long-Houghton ?.
   Are the apparently detached parts of a Basaltic stratum be
tween Bamborough-Castle and Kyloe, really detached ?, (not
owing to alluvia or peat, making them appear so) ; and if so, do
not the dips of the strata indicate, that such Hummocks occupy
the lower parts of a trough in the measures ?
    In ascending the Tweed from its mouth, where does Basalt
cross its bed ? or appear in its banks ?; or over-lieing Red Marl
or its Sandstone commence, to prevent further observations on
the regular or continuous strata of that district ?.
   Again. Does not the Basaltic stratum, at or to the W or SW
of Jemming, assume, first a S and then a SW dip, so a,,, in rea
lity, to range awayNW ?, instead of SW, to pass Richargill and
join the eastmost of the two ranges of Basalt depicted in Mr.
Professor Buckland's Map, in Vol. iv plate 5 of the Geol. Trans.,
as seems intimated near the top of p. 117?
    Do not Mr. B.'s two ranges of Basalt belong to the same slra~

  ring? (or rings, if they join in more than two places?) ; if
  so, where are its ends situate ? ; and if not, in what way are the
  two ranges terminated or lost sight of, at one or both of their
  ends   ?
     Does the Basalt of the upper part of the Tees (mentioned pp.
  73 and 74), really basset there towards the S ? /'showing its upper-
  measures on the N, and its under-measures on the S of the Ba
  saltic Area?, (and in such case, does it join, and by what route, to
  the easternmost of Mr. Buckland's ranges ?; and can it be traced
  the other way under the; magnesian Limestone ?); or, does it
  dip and take cover on the S side, as well as the N ?, appearing to
  day, in consequence of the upper or Lead-measures being ex
  cavated from off it ? : in the latter case, is one or more rings
 formed, by the basalt also being locally cut through ?, if so, what
 strata (besides Hornstone or Chert, p. 74) are thereby exposed
 to view ?.
     3rd. Are not the seven localities* of muscle-like Shells f, in
 the Ironstones and their accompanying Shales, which Mr. Winch
 Frere, or any other Gentleman) for revising and freely stating the facts, as
 to the interesting district which Professor Buckland has described Geol.

 thickness, at the bottom of p. 6'i in Mr.W.'s Paper,means the extended aud
 irregularly thick stratum or mass of over-lieing (and in part unconforma
 ble) Red Marl and its Freestone and Gypsum, mentioned by Mr. Forster
 p. 43, and shown by Mr. Buckland west of both his ranges of Dasalt?; or,
 is it the defined and comparatively thin stratum, coloured red, between the
 two Basalts, and apparently, conformable to the eastern range?  the aver
 age and extreme visible thickness of this stratum? : its roof and floor mea

 tions" (p. 118), do not satisfy the Querist, w ho has no knowledge, or desire
 to know, whether the epithets " old " or " new," should designate either
of these strata.
    * The Querist regrets vastly, the smallness of this

    Sir, 
         I      now write to show that      am not the original author
                                                    I

    with the greatest joy, that       has been previously published and

    acknowledged              by
                        one of the cleverest men, and the most scien
    tific observer, of the last century.   Mr. Henry Baker      the per   is
    son to whom      allude. Unfortunately he did not

  want of time) pursue the fact through a series of inquiries, as it
  should certainly have been done.      Such discoveries have often
 been thrown    off merely because they want the leading points to
  serve as conductors, or the continuing line to pursue the course
 begun. Possessing such a fact, so strong, so important, it should
 never have been neglected, but traced in its preceding and fol
 lowing points : if this had been done, the whole circle of vege
 table life would now probably have been well known and under
 stood.
     I showed in my last letter, that seeds, when cut into extreme
 thin slices horizontally , gave the appearance of many very di
 minutive shoots, with a root to each, or a long continuance of a
 thin narrow pattern running all over the seed, and surrounding
 the embryo at a small distance. I was not the least aware that
 this was before known ; since it had not at all corrected our ideas
 concerning the formation of plants, which supposes but one germ
 in each seed. But I now find, in looking over The Philoso
 phical Transactions for the year 1739, that Mr. Henry Baker
had in that work given an account of his discovery, which I here
 copy from his own letter.
    " The growth of animals and vegetables seems to be nothing
else but a gradual unfolding and expansion of their vessels, by
a slew and expressive insinuation of fluids adapted to their dia
meters, until, being stretched to the utmost bounds allotted them
by Providence at their first formation, they reach their state of
perfection or full growth.     If this be granted, the consequence
must be, that all members of a perfect animal exist really in
every animalcula, and that all the parts of a perfect plant exist
in every little grain of the farina plantarum, however minute.
Amongst numberless inquirers whom the opinion " that every
seed   includesmany real plants," (has set to work to open all
kinds of seeds and try by glasses to find evident proofs thereof,)
I have not been the least industrious: but after repeated experi
ments in every manner I could think of, I began to despair of
success.   If by moistening the seed it began to vegetate, I could
indeed discern the seminal leaves and the germen or bud whence
the future plant should arise, but was able to go no further, un
less I waited till the moisture gradually distending its vessels,
made the little root or heart shoot down, and stalk rise up, and
the minute leaves expand and bring themselves to view.         This
however was not the thing sought : but some days ago, by mere
accident, when I thought nothing about      it,
                                             I   was favoured with a
discovery  Ihad   so often  searched after to no  purpose    Endea
vouring with   a fine lancet to dissect a  seed of the Gramen tu-
mulentum, with intention to examine the several parts of the
case with  a microscope, I    struck the point of the lancet into

texture of the husks, the edges of which I observed to be trans

very thin piece which set at liberty my object, which on exami

     It will be thought perhaps extraordinary that              should be so    1
delighted to find this part of my discovery forestalled. But first,
I   am truly charmed to get any additional proof of the truth of
a   part of my system          and    am really so anxious to establish
                                           :       I

 being, as        now,
                  it   is   parcel of detached imaginations, so contra
                                       a
 dictory in themselves that not three botanists think alike upon
 any one subject, and most of them are contradicted by Nature
 and dissection,  that        care very little who makes the discovery,

 thing therefore that occurred to me, was to try whether these
 germs (found in the case of the seed) would increase                    water          if
 was put to them while on glass. This they did in                  few days         a           ;

nutive as to be hardly visible) began in a few hours to swell, and
in two days the shoot had run from the heart of the seed ; but it
 was very different from the shoot which leaves the full-grown
seed : it was evident that this was not yet formed, that it was
 merely the heart of the future germ, which contained the little
 shoot of leaves and female flowers of that female, which passes
from one seed to another, from one plant to another, which is
 sent up the radicle as a beginning for the r.eiu coagulated seeds,
just formed from powder, and which serves (I think) not each for
 a new plant, but for the foundation of each different stripe of
 flowers which runs up the wood.        So direct does this fact ap
 pear  to me, that I think  it  almost   impossible to doubt it.    To
 me indeed,   who  had  seen   the flower  coagulate in the end  of the
 radicle, then form into balls and pass through the root, enter
 and run up the alburnum, pass into the flower-bud, where in a
 short time it was fructified and its case added  it was impos
 sible, after such a series of proofs, to doubt that these balls
 were seeds ; but by botanists in general, I am told, stronger
 proofs were demanded : but the growth of the shoot in the
 heart of the seed must certainly be perfectly convincing.       What
 more can be required !
    Mr. Baker adds these lines :
       "   Each seed includes some plants, those plants again
           Have other seeds, which other plants contain;
           Those other plants have all their seeds, and those
           More plants again successively inclose.
           Thus every single berry which we find
           Has really in itself whole forests of its kind."
    Now this appears to me to be carrying the evidence far be
yond what the appearance will justify.        Mr. Baker had made
no preceding dissections that could trace these shoots; and there
fore looked on these diminutive roots found in the husk of the
seed, as each a separate plant, or new germ.       But I, having be
fore traced them in every part of the vegetable, cannot think
as he did in this respect : they appear to me to be only the
means Nature takes to prolong the female flower, from root to
root, from seed to seed ; and that the seed, with its different
roots and its embryo, serves only as the different parts of one
plant, and no more ; and I think the following specimen, whioh
 I have dissected, of a bean will justify my opinion, (see fig. 3,
 cut open.)    Here the seed a a is retained close to the plant,
 though the embryo has left       till the vegetable has enlarged its
                                  it,
 wood and line of life sufficiently to take in the female flowers
 which pass through the two holders bb, of the seed aa, and run
 in stripes into the wood.     give, however, the specimens as ex
                                I
  actly as I found them     :Let every one explain them as they
                                                                please.

                   On   the   Physiology   of   Vegetables.       129
please.  But these roots do not appear to me to be separate
plants ; but only the foundation of the various stripes in the
wood, and the means Nature takes to secure the impossibility
of the female ever failing. Had they been separate plants, and
 to serve as new seeds (as he supposes), would they not have fallen
 into the earth to serve as such, and not attached themselves to
 the new plant a second time, though the embryo had already
 escaped from it ? Thus the husk is secured, not only to supply
 new moisture, to form a new root in case the young should be!
 destroyed by insects ; but that the different little roots might
 have time to run their stripes up the various parts of the wood,
 and thus fill the new plant with the female flower.              
     I am assured by some of the first botanists, that they dispute
 not the truth of my dissections  that they believe them all to be
just and right ; but that it is my system they cannot credit.       1
 know not how this can be : I always thought that what is so
 called, was but my drawings translated into words.         However,
  I dispute not the right each person has to explain the specimens
 in their own way. This last will certainly admit of two different
 constructions ; and by continuing the dissection of plants a year
 or two longer, we may be more fitted to lay down a system that
 may be nearer the truth than that I have attempted : yet, having
  followed it from year to year in a regular picture, a few days
  only intervening, no one can conceive (but myself) how exact
  such a picture is.    But one thing I must observe, that if the
 drawings are true, the very opposite of the specimens cannot
  also be just; and that most of the present received opinions are
  in direct contradiction  not only to Nature's established laws in
 the physical and botanical world, but they arc also in absolute
 contrast to the appearance of specimens I have given, and even
 to their own also, as I shall show.
     I shall first present two specimens of wood, given by most
 botanists, to prove that there is no passage for the sap through
 the vjood, as was always formerly supposed; The one is a specimen
 given by Grew, the other by Mirbel.      It would appear by a first
 look, that large apertures fitted for the nourishment of a great
 tree were plainly to be seen in both (see dddd, fig. 5 and 6,);
 but our later botanists are of a different opinion, and throw
 all the juice so large a matter would seem to require, into the
 smallest hair the tree contains, and which is besides most extreme
 ly twisted.     The reason given for it    " that though there are
                                                is,
 apparent large apertures, and well formed voids, yet, when the
 wood     istaken thread from thread, not a cylinder can be disco
  vered with   a passage through it. This      certainly true hence
                                                      is      ;
it   is concluded, that,      in
                            spile of  the appearance of these aper
  tures, there can be no passage for liquids through the wood

but the diminutive spirals before mentioned.              Yet surely this
conclusion is premature, and does not follow the premises. If a
solid matter is taken, and a quantity of large holes drilled through
it, in its whole length;  that matter

voids in the wood instead of vessels.           As the flower-buds pass
across the wood when first running to the bark,            thev had beenif
vessels they would continually have been twisted and impeded in
their progress, stopping the liquor they contained           but, formed ;
as   avoid, they are so large as to bear being pushed             little out      a

    If there is no passage in these spiral vessels, they cannot carry
the sap; and it must pass through the Vessels, or rather voids,
which so plainly appear in the wood at fig. 5 and 6. Indeed the
French authors are all of this, opinion j and of dissectors I know
but Mr. Knight, who turns over the office to these diminutive
twisted vessels.     Du Hamel looked on the spirals as containing
air only: but they have a much more important office, and are
certainly the universal cause of motion to plants, resembling the
animal muscles in every respect, and possessing, lika them, that
vis insita which is a proof of their identity impossible to deny.

                              To   Mr. Tillnch.
Sir,  The      truth of astro-atmospherical science         not deter  is
minable    byplausibility of argument,     the only test     which its  by
foundation in Nature or its baseless fabric in visionary hypothesis
can be ascertained,       that of experience.
                         is                        By advocating this
subject,  I do  not  intend  to throw   down   the gauntlet in defence
of all that astrologers, ancient or modern, may have advanced                         ;
and   Iconsider your admission of my papers as no proof of your
coincidence in opinion, but as       laudable proof of your liberality
                                         a
in the investigation of      doctrine which was maintained in an
                              a
cient time, has still numerous advocates            Eastern countries,
                                                            in

                                               a
nerally admitted.
   In our modern works on the sciences no traces of the elements
of study of sidereal influences are retained; the subject
   a                                                         men               is
tioned as a chimerical hypothesis; and     requires a hardihood of
                                                       it
daring, or a persuasion of the truth, to advocate what so many
wits are ready to ridicule, and so many learned men are forward
to speak of in terms of contempt, reproach, and reprobation.
  I  could supply your pages with a multitude of plausible ob
jections to this science but that
                              :      not my province in this cor

   respondence ; and I frankly acknowledge myself to be incompe
   tent to reply to all the objections which may be offered.     As on
   every other subject, so on this, I hold myself ready to embrace
   conviction, whether substantiating or overthrowing a hypothesis
  which I now believe to be founded on the established laws of
  Nature, although long observation and accurate deduction may
  be requisite to recover the knowledge which has been lost.
       I cannot apprehend that any of your readers will take alarm
  at an attempt to obtain for the doctrine of sidereal influences on
  the atmosphere a fair investigation.         The ignorant might su
  spect the subject of atmospherical astrology to be somewhat al
 lied to magic or necromancy  the probability of such an error
  I. infer from having some years ago experienced the consequences
 of ignorance respecting those imaginary phantoms imputed to
 diabolical agency.
      A young man bathing at Ellingham in Norfolk was drowned.
 A female Samaritan, possessed of more information than her
 neighbours, employed the means recommended by the Humane
 Society;  but, amidst the ridicule of the ignorant and the terror
 of the superstitious at her presumptuous attempt to animate the
 dead, just as some signs of resuscitation appeared, sunk under
 her fatigue, and the body became a corpse past all recovery.        I
 rode through the parish before the villagers had dispersed ; but
 some hours having elapsed, I merely joined in the conversation
 of the groups through which I passed, to the confusion of the in
 credulous, and in corroboration of the opinions of a few who had
 arrived too late to contribute their willing aid.     About the same
 time I was trying some electrical experiments on a young fowl
which I found as I supposed dead in the yard more than an hour
before.       My object was to notice the most ready passage for the
electric fluid.    During the experiments I was surprised by some
signs of returning life, and persevered with different motives to
those at my commencement.           Having applied many small shocks
through the brain, and numerous sparks in various directions, I
placed it in a jar which I continued to supply with a portion of
electric fluid insufficient to produce a spontaneous explosion.
I continued my varied processes about three quarters of an
hour, by which time it was so far recovered that weakness was
the only indication that it had ever ceased to manifest all the
signs of life.    I electrified it at liberty the next morning, when
it fled from the sparks with as much agility as any of the brood.
The fame of this occurrence was spread through a rustic neigh
bourhood, amongst whom there were many not deficient in
ignorance; and so foolish was the idea entertained by them, that,
when a child a few days after fell into a small body of water, my
                                  1 3                         readily-

134             On Astro-atmospherical Science.
readily-offered    assistance was refused with horror, because
nothing less than diabolical cooperation could have induced me
to expect to recover a life which God had permitted to cease.
    I trust my motive in the insertion of these anecdotes will be
obvious, as they serve to prove the vague ideas which have pro
bably given rise to the old stories of magic and necromancy .
   The experiments in the practice of what is now usually com
prehended under Natural Philosophy, have ever appeared to the
uninformed wonderful effects beyond the ordinary power of hu
man nature.       Hence Friar Bacon and other Franciscans en
dured the censure of their ignorant contemporaries: and necro
mancy has, I conceive, no other origin than what has been
ascribed to it by weak minds, whose terrors may have been aug
mented by the artful for sinister purposes.
    Every friend of literature must regret the destruction of the
library founded bv Ptolemy Philadelphus, which is said to have
contained four hundred thousand valuable manuscriptSj when
Julius Caasar (47 A. C.) set fire to Alexandria.
   A second library, founded by the successors of Ptolemy, in
tended to repair the loss of the former, and said to have con
sisted of seven hundred thousand volumes, was destroyed by
Omar the caliph of the Saracens, A. D. 642.
    Without noticing other collections of ancient literature which
have been destroyed by conflagration,      I cannot hesitate to ex
press regret   that  the  mathematicians   were  so indiscriminately
                                  '
banished from ancient Kome : nor can I see aught to commend
in the voluntary destruction of books on the subject of natural
philosophy, by some of the early converts to Christanity.  In
those days all the labours of the learned were in manuscript ;
and we may infer that in numerous instances they were irreco
verable:  the impetuosity of the Roman warriors, the bigotry of
the Saracen army, and the unrestrained zeal of the Christian
converts, contributed to annihilate many monuments cf ancient
knowledge, whence we might have obtained the elements and
the rationale of the systems which had in the most ancient pe
riods of the world been maintained.
      If,
       instead of such infatuated measures, we could nowbring to the
test of enlightened science, whatever contributed to raise the fame
of those reputed learned, we might discriminate truth from error.
    If (to descend to later period instead of acts of parliament
                    a              ),
against witckcraj't, (which were not till within our own time re^
pealed,) the development of the pretended secrets had been en
couraged, the absurdity of the belief would have been most
effectually exploded, and posterity would have been rescued
from the possibilityof    imagining that nothing short of diabolical
                                                            agency

agency rendered the united efforts of ecclesiastical and oivi'
power necessary to counteract and suppress it.
   If,  instead of hearing that works of alchemy, &c. had been
without examination destroyed, we, in this enlightened age, pos
sessed an opportunity of exploring all that         comprehended un
                                                    is
der the denomination of occult sciences, we should be able to se
parate the chaff from the wheat, and demonstrate the means              by
which the fallaciousness of misconception, misinterpretation,         or
delusive artifice, had subjugated the minds of men.
    The progress which has in late years been made in Oriental
literature, encourages an expectation that the arrow-headed
character and the symbolic representations still found on the re
maining monuments of remote ages, may yet be deciphered, and
serve to develop many particulars        relative to the knowledge of
the ancients in arts and sciences.
    Josephus says of the sons of Seth       " These were the first that
                                            :
made their observations upon the motions of the heavens, the
courses and influences of the stars     : and having been foretold by
Adam of    a    universal deluge and conflagration to come, they
erected two pillars, one of brick and the other of stone, which
they were sure would be         a  proof, one or the other of them,
against either fire or water.      Upon these pillars they engraved
the memorials of their discoveries and inventions, there to remain
for the benefit of ages to come     ;  and lest the tradition of the.
science itself should be lost for want of       arecord."
   Thence, sir, we perceive that this mode of perpetuating             in
formation  is   of great antiquity  ; and we are led to infer that the
figures which still abound on ancient edifices, are not mere or
naments, but the chronicles of history and philosophy, ex
ecuted on  a    presumption that    a key to their symbols, their hie
roglyphics    and  their characters, would   be preserved.
    As the ruins of Persepolis and other temples indicate,        by
                                                                   their
partially   mouldered    columns   and mutilated   works   of sculpture,
the grandeur of design in those who planned, and the admirable
skill of the artists who executed those edifices     ;   may rationally
                                                         it
be inferred, that those adages of ancient philosophers which have

mises whence their deductions were made, must have been the
result of long experience and solid judgement, founded on the
observations of natural philosophy aided        by minute astronomical
and mathematical calculations.  But to return to
                       Astro-meteorology.

modern times, nor     is  to be expected without the concurrent

       None of the fragments of this science which have fallen under
   my observation are sufficiently minute to encourage a confident
   anticipation of all the phenomena which the changes in the at
   mosphere produce: and I conceive that an unreserved communi
   cation of conjectures,  those which have been verified and those
   not verified, will be the most certain mode of putting to the test
   this almost exploded science.
      With this view an anonymous paragraph was inserted in The
   Norwich Mercury, early in January 1816
                                                    (the weather being
  remarkably fine), announcing snow on the 28th or 29th of that
  month.
      During more than twenty      years 1 had observed 6 <U+25A1> or g of
   12  and g had been coincident with snow in the winter season,
  and rain in the other parts of the              fj and g were to be

  tion with Saturn on the 29th.       Some snow and sleet fell on the
  25th at Norwich, latitude 52° 44', and on the following
                                                                     days;
 but the greatest descent was on the 29th.
      I think I may venture to assert, that whatever the result of
  the situations of the planets, accordmg to ancient or modern an
 ticipations, theelfects are not fully manifested until the moon by
  her position becomes a powerful

 fell.
      May 9th, <U+25A1>       g melting snow or rain was to be expected,

requested to select some days, and offer my conjectures.             On a
 hasty reference to White's' Ephemeris the following were se
 lected, having regard to the positions of the planets at and
 near the times.        For an almost immediate reply to an unex
pected request, no more than a cursory view could be taken. I
have now subjoined the premises on which the
                                                       conjectures were

    The above were verified, excepting that 2d, 3d, and 4th of
October were not entirely free from partial showers.
    On reference to your Magazine, it appears that
June 12. in the Journal kept at Boston, is recorded "very fine."

a register so ample as appears desirable.          1 have quoted the

wish to invite the attention of meteorologists, and propose ha
zarding some anticipations in a future paper.

 (to be otherwise accounted for), became north

 XXXII. Brief Notice of        a Discovery by which Sir H. Davy's

     Safe-lamp may      be made to re-light itself when extinguished
     in the Mine. By       J. Murray, Esq.
                             To Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,     It   gives me much pleasure to announce to you the
following important fact :  a method by which Sir Humphry
Davy's safe-lamp may be made to relight itself when ex
 tinguished by an inflammable medium.             The experiment was
repeated eight times with uniform and unerring success in the
laboratory of this Institution, on the evening of the third instant,
before a number of gentlemen ; and it was also proved that, in
dependent of such a provision, the lamp must have been ex
tinguished  a fact, indeed, that even the tyro of chemistry is
well aware of; namely, the extinction of an ignited body wheii
enveloped by an inflammable medium.            For this purpose a me
tallic wire (platinum, steel, and copper were the metals em
ployed) coiled up in a spiral form was exposed to the flame,
close to the wick: the instrument was lighted, and, after some
time, the wire, having become intensely red hot, was plunged
into a vessel containing coal gas.        At each sudden immersion
the lamp was extinguished ; but on the expenditure of the gas,
instantaneously rekindled.
    On the fourth instant, a number of similar experiments were
repeated, and with results equally satisfactory.         Different me
thods of keeping the wire in the flame were tried in these ex
periments.      That represented in fig. A (Plate II.) was found to
be a very convenient arrangement.        The wire was from l-23th to
l-30th of an inch in diameter; the diameter of the spiral about
l-3d of an inch ; the number of revolutions in the spiral coil 7,
and these about l-30th of an inch apart.
    When the lamp is kept well trimmed and supplied with sper
maceti oil, the wire will be preserved of a temperature suffi
ciently exalted to rekindle the lamp on its extinction, so that all
                                                                   the

the miner will now have to do, is simply to depress the lamp
into the lower strata of the atmosphere of the mine, and it will
relight itself; and when exploring an extensive magazine of
fire-damp, platinum wire, on Sir H. Davy's late interesting dis
covery, will be the preferable metal.            The miner will not have
to complain of " being long in the darh."
    This instrument is now one of the most curious and interesting
that can possibly be contemplated  an envelope, open, yet im
pervious to Jlame  possessing within itself when extinguished,
the property of exhibiting a light unconnected with Jlame, suffi
cient to guide the miner through the dark abysses of the earth,
in an inflammable and explosive atmosphere ; and the means of
relighting itself on passing from an inflammable medium, which
exceeds the explosive, into the free atmosphere.             This mode of
applying    the  platinum     wire,  you  will at once   perceive, is more
important    than  suspending     it in the  top  of  the instrument, and
it will not only not intercept light, but exhibit a more brilliant
flame.
                     I am respectfully, sir,
                             Yours most obediently,
London, Surry Institution,   Feb. 5, 1817.                   J. MURRAY.
    P. S.  I rejoice in   the near prospect      I  have  of proving  this
in the mine itself.                                                J. M.
       XXXIII.     Reply to    Mr. Horn.       By Mr. W. Pater.
                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,     In   the last number of your Philosophical Magazine, Mr.
Andrew Horn has condescended to notice some remarks 1 made
upon his Theory of Vision in a former number ; and with that
suavity of manners and in that free and easy way so peculiarly
his own, without a preamble he charges me with ignorance and
inconsistency ; and I think myself obliged to him that he con
fined himself to merely making the charges without attempting
to prove them : perhaps it would have been better had he given
 the proofs and spared the insult.
    In his answer to my remarks there is one trifling oversight; 
he has totally forgotten to explain the difficulties, or to reply to
 the objections !
    There is also a little unfairness which I have to complain of,
which in Mr. Horn is perhaps not strictly honourable: in my
attack I made use of reason, but he has defended himself with
 insolence.
    Mr, Horn allows that light excites sensation by acting upon
                                                                        the

                      is         it  be not to be understood to be the
 optic nerve,  he does not attempt to explain.
     Mr. Andrew Horn seems, somehow or other, now to be little                         a
 ashamed of his newly-discovered idea, that this image painted
 in the middle of the vitreous humour in caustic,          to be seen is                      by
 the optic nerve behind; but the words which follow          " and thus
 the optic impression and position of the tangible object are re
 conciled,"  they mean any thing, can have no other interpre
                 if
 tation  ; for, to suppose that light         reflected from the optic
                                                   is
 nerve to form an image in the middle of the vitreous humour,
 and that then    it   to be reflected back again to the optic nerve,
                       is
 merely for the sake of being sent there and back again, would
 be sending the light on what some would call         sleeveless errand,

 but I  would call     a Wycombe hoax.
                      it
    Instead of explaining these difficulties, Mr. Andrew Horn
 passes them unnoticed, and begins an harangue about Sir Isaac
 Newton's ignorance and his own correcter knowledge, and brings
 forward     few legerdemain tricks with a prism.
             a                                            Why this                      ?     1

Why then were these things introduced,             not with the design
                                                        if
of drawing the attention from the subject in question, which
did not suit Mr. Horn to reply to, for reasons which perhaps                                 it it
is  not difficult to guess      ?
    However, upon closer inspection, this theory which Mr. An
drew Horn has given of the prismatic spectrum, has some little
excuse for its intrusion, as         evidently own brother
                                     it   is                      the fa          by
ther's side to caustic reflection, and appears to me to be equally
whimsical, unfounded, and unsatisfactory                !
    Of this theory the hole of the window-shutter           the groundis
work or first mover, its edge repels polarized light, which           that             by
means    is  dispersed    which dispersed rays the prism collects,
                            ;
mixes together, and makes colours of them.            Unfortunately for
the theory, neither the hole nor the window-shutter
                                                                           a is
                                                              necessary                       ;
as the direct parallel rays of the sun, falling upon           side of a
prism at a certain angle          open day, will be formed into the
                                    in
coloured spectrum, without any crossing of rays, inversion of
images, holes, or window- shutters, having any thing to do             the             in
matter.
    But as have no wish to hold any controversy with
             I                                                       man           a

           XXXIV.           On Mr. Horn's Theory of Vision.
                            By A Correspondent.
                                 To   Mr. Tillock.
Sir,  The        perusal of a paper in your last, from Mr. Horn,
upon Vision, induced me by its novelty to refer to his former
communication, but without receiving any kind of satisfaction.
His theory appeared to me, prima facie, absurd, which I think
a very little reflection will prove.    He asserts that " light acts
upon the optic nerve and excites sensation there, and not upon
the retina ; that the chief function of vision is assignable to the
base of the nerve, and the optic images are formed by caustic re
flection in the vitreous humour."         I really do not understand

the retina," -&c. if the retina      as i-,have always understood

of the nerve     ?Reasoning from analogy, we should infer the con
trary  to be the  case.    The other nerves of the body receive sen
sation only at their extremities.    The depth in which their trunks
lie buried, and an every day's occurrence after the loss of limb,           a
prove that,      the trunk of the nerve, which before the amputa
                 if
tion of the limb had ramified upon the toes, be injured, the
sensorium refers the pain to its former situation, and the patient
does not feel pain at the injured spot, but in that spot where the
sensation of the nerve had been usually excited; namely, in his
toes.    Besides,     the retina does not receive sensation, but
                      if                                                 a      is

                          A

That " the optic images are formed                by

 does reflect, what is the use of the pigmentum nigrum P arid
 how is the image formed by " caustic reflection " to be im
 pressed upon the " base of the nerve ?" It is not a tangible body:
 and Mr. Horn will not, I presume, have the boldness to assert
 that rays passing through a medium shall be reflected at a
 certain point, without any alteration in the density of that me
 dium.      Yet were all his positions correct, the vitreous humour
 must diminish the image, which will be considerably larger than
the base of the nerve, and reflect it afterwards  a power which no
one in his senses will allow it.         What then would be the conse
 quence    of  such   reflection?   Why, the rays would decussate each
 other in every possible angle; and instead of one we should have
 a hundred images, not one of which would approach the base
 of the nerve.
    If these statements are true,  and I don't see how they can be
 disproved, as they are little more than a collection of facts, 
What foundation has Mr. Horn for his theory ?

 XXXV. On        the Sulphuret      of Carbon and on Flame,     &c.     By
                              J. Murray,     Esq.
                                To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,      In   an early number of the " Annals of Philosophy," I
pointed out some phenomena attendant on the great reduction
of temperature by the evaporation of sulphuret of carbon. I
find that if a few drops of this fluid be passed into a vessel of
oxygen, it will explode violently on application of an ignited
taper to the orifice.          Sulphuret of carbon burns, when pre
viously ignited    in  a  medium   of chlorine,but does not inflame spon
taneously    therein   ;  when  burning in contact with the atmosphere
it exhibits an exaltation of temperature exceeding in intensity
that of any other unexplosive flame, I have yet examined. Steel
wire of l-30th inch diameter burnt almost as vividly in this
flame as in oxygen.          Even a watch-spring fused with scintilla
tion, and fine fibres of amianthus and platinum wire readily
melted. Of the flames exhibited by combined hydrogen, those of
hydrozincic gas and of boretted hydrogen appear to be the most
intense ; for in these, steel wire fuses vividly, and fine fibres of
amianthus melt.
    The blueish flames of alcohol, ether, &c. exhibit a rose-colour
by the introduction of metals, charcoal, &c. and in the green
flame of boretted hydrogen, &c. evolve a yellow colour. Scarlet,
rose, and carmine, are the colours most generally produced with
                                                                       this

this treatment of blue flame, and various shades of yellow, &c.
 with green flame. I shall only observe in the meantime, I
think it very probable that the colour of flame, and particularly
 of the lamina or border (which in that of sulphuret of carbon
 is a fine blue) with its (the edge) width, will determine the
grade of ignition ; and it is my opinion that all flames have a
decided electrical character, which will express their relation to
the intensities of ignition.
    Oxygen compressed in Newman's blowpipe and passed through
the flame of sulphuret of carbon produces a much more violent
heat, than when alcohol is substituted as in Dr. Marcet's experi
ment.
    I have lately made but few experiments with the compressed
 gases in the      blowpipe.     I however repeated successfully
Dr. Clarke's experiment with the rubies ; I also fused two sap
phires into one. In one instance I completely perforated the
stem of a tobacco-pipe, which the jet of inflamed gases vitrified
in its passage,  a steel file before      literally, as Dr. Clarke ex
                                                        it,

                                  a   fire."    In this experiment                      it   is
adviseable to detach the bladder containing the mixed gases,
lest the sparks should ignite the explosive volume.
                      am respectfully, sir,
                            I

   P.S.     should be stated, that when the red-hot platinum wire
             It
isintroduced into      wine-glass containing sulphuret of carbon,
                             a                                                               it
always  kindles the  fluid   but it' will be seen to continue red hot
                                      ;
between the surface of the fluid and the base of the flame.

leads me to suppose that this sulphuret results from the combina

             a                                             but in               :

endeavoured to ascertain whether this mode of composition be
also that of other sulphurets.

offers the greatest difference :  according to Berzelius I have
found about a hundredth of sulphur in 100 parts in weight; and
 according to Seguin it is less by half a hundredth.
      As my experiments on this occasion may possess some interest
on account of science, I have ventured to offer the following

had given birth to.
     M.Fant, Professor of History in the University of Upsal, has
published the prospectus of a work to be entitled Scriptores
Rerum Suecicarum Medii JEvi. There has been long wanting
in Sweden a collection of the chronicles, diplomas, and other
historical monuments of the middle age. The late King Gusta-
vus III. gave orders to M. Nordin, bishop of Hernaesand, to col
lect the various monuments scattered in different archives and
libraries, some in MS. and others inaccurately printed.    M. Nor
din proceeded to Stockholm, and occupied himself for ten years
with this work; but having returned to his diocese after the death
of Gustavus III. he could. not continue his enterprise, and the
materials which he had collected remained in his private library.
At his death his heirs wished to sell at a high price this impor
tant collection : the Prince Royal bought it, and presented it to
the library of the University of Upsal. The reigning King of
 Sweden has ordered it to be published at the expense of the
State.     M. Fant has been directed to revise it,   to complete it,
and to give an edition similar to that of Langebeck's collection
entitled Scriptores Rerum Danicarum.        This collection of the
historians of Sweden will therefore soon appear the first volume*

will fill three volumes in folio, and the price of each volume will
 be only about fifteen shillings English.

platinum were dissolved in nitro-muriatic acid, the solution eva
porated to dryness, and afterwards boiled with potash and ammo-
nia,in nearly the same manner as the aurum fulminans is prepared,
when the author found a gray powder which explodes violently
on exposure to heat. On its explosive powers Mr. Davy made
a great variety of experiments, and also to ascertain with pre
cision its real nature and constitution.             On heating the gray
powder     with lime  in a  retort,  ammonia    and  waterwere   produced ;

analysed every product with great care, and investigated all the
new or peculiar appearances with unusual fidelity and minute
ness, in order to discover accurate data for a, correct rationale of
this new fulminating powder, which he considers as a triple salt,
composed of oxide of platinum and ammonia.                 It explodes gen
tly at the temperature of 300 Fah. and violently at 400.; whereas
the aurum fulminans explodes violently at temperatures be
 tween 120 and 300.             From a great number of experiments
Mr. D. states that 100 grains of this fulminating platinum con
sists of oxide of platinum 82-5, of which 72 are metal and 10'5
oxygen ; of ammonia 9, and water 8-5 = 100.

been made to the Society by the indefatigable Dr. Brewster, " On
the phenomena of optical contact ; the inflexion of light ; the
colours of thin plates ; the production of nebulous images by
doubly refracting crystals ; the distribution of the polarising

    A paper by the Rev. Dr. Fleming,      " On    the junction of the
fresh-water of rivers with the salt-water of the sea," details a
number of experiments made in the Firth of Tay, with an ap
paratus by which water could be brought from any given depth.
It appears from these experiments, that when the flow of a river
is obstructed by the tide, the salt-water slides under the fresh like
a wedge, and sends the fresh to the surface.

                   Sitting   of the 9th       Sept. 1816.
    MM.   de Lacdpede,   GeofFroy-Saint-Hilaire, and Dumeril made
a  Report   to  the Academy upon the Monographic des Trigono-
cephales des Antilles of M. Moreau de Jonnes.
   The serpent which is the subject of the memoir of M. Jonnes
is of a large size, and its bite is very dangerous ; it has been seen
more than eight feet long.       The author affirms that it is con
fined to the islands of Martinique, St. Lucia and Baconia, and
that it has never been observed on the continent of America.
    It is well known that the species of vertebral animals which
see better by night than by day, or which are very sensible to
light, present in general a vertical pupil. M. Jonnes has ob
served the same disposition in the iris of the trigonocephalus
which he describes.      This animal, whose agility is very remark
able,   has  a  peculiar manner   of darting itself.  It curls up its
body into four equal circles, one above another, and these ma
king their circumvolutions all at once, it projects itself thus in
mass to the distance of five or six feet.        Another fact which
M. de Jonnes mentions,        is,that the trigonocephalus can in the
manner of the najos rear itself upon its tail to the height of          a
man.      He assures us further, that           by
                                              means of certain large
scales with which the belly of this reptile      covered,

most efficacious means for preventing the fatal consequences of
the bite of this serpent, are the same as have been used in Europe
with more success in opposing the development of hydrophobia.

.1  he question respecting the figure of the earth, and the ano
malies in the English and other trigonometrical surveys, which
has given rise to so much interesting discussion during the last
three or four years,  is likely to receive considerable illustration
in the course of the present. The gentlemen engaged in the
trigonometrical survey, having purchased expressly for this pur
pose, about three years ago,    a  fine astronomical clock, (made
by Pennington,) intend taking       it  to the Orkneys with other
apparatus, as soon as the season         sufficiently advanced, to as
                                        is
certain the vibrations of pendulums at that high northern lati
tude.   MM. Biot and Arago are deputed from the French Aca
demy to meet them there with the pendulum apparatus which
has already been employed on the arc of the meridian between
Dunkirk and Formentera.        And  it    hoped that another depu
                                         is
tation from the Royal Society will join the party.           The same
respective  sets of  apparatus  will be  carried  to several points be
tween the Orkneys and Blackdown (near Weymouth)              ; and thus
in connexion with the results already obtained on the continent,
being spread over an arc of nearly      21degrees, must furnish some
extremely interesting data for the future investigations of mathe
maticians and philosophers.
               INDENTATIONS     IN THE SUN'S EDGE.
   Several years ago Dr. Herschel, after tracing   solar spot across
                                                   a
part of the sun's disk, until  .passed off its edge, observed
                              it                                  to       it
occasion there an indentation   ; and thereby he made the impor
tant discovery, that the spots on the sun are depressions in the
surface, or holes through the luminous atmosphere            by
                                                          which the

sun is surrounded.  Now although solar spots are not of uncom
mon occurrence, their magnitudes and motions, compared with
 the sun's disk, are so small, and the chances, during the sun's
 appearance, of observers being at their telescopes at the proper
times for seeing a spot, or hollow of sufficient depth, on the appa
rent edge of the sun, are in consequence so small, that Dr. Her-
schel has not more than once or twice since, been able to repeat
his observations on the indented edge of the sun, and numerous
telescopic observers have never yet been gratified by this curious
sight.
     It happened on Friday, January 31st last, at one o'clock in
 the afternoon, that two hollows, producing indentations, were
 at the same time coming on the sun's disk, in the lower right-
 hand quarter, as seen through a reversing telescope with a mag
 nifying power of lOOtimes. Mr. Hem y Hubert, coal-merchant, in
 Little Abingdon-street, Westminster, was then trying an excellent
four feet Dolloiui's achromatic, which he had recently purchased,
searching for small spots on the sun's disk ; and he saw, near to
gether, two conspicuous and large indents in the otherwise re
 markably true and circular disk of the sun, as mentioned above;
 that which appeared lowest was by far the broadest and deepest
 indent, extending to a great depth upon the face of the sun's
 disk (beyond the apparent loss of substance therein); the bottom
 or inner edge of them appeared irregular, and not circular. There
 were a number of small spots, about ten or twelve in a group,
 at a small distance from the above indentations.        Mr. Hubert
was in hopes of being able to repeat his observations some days
 afterwards, but clouds intervened at the time of the indentations
 passing off the opposite edge of the sun's disk.

     The following letter, addressed by the Earl of Albemarle to
  the Norfolk farmers, is of much importance to agriculturists in
  general :
     " Gentlemen,  Having made some experiments relating to
  the probability of a good crop next harvest, to be grown from
  black barley used for seed, 1 think it cannot be uninteresting to
 you to be acquainted with the results.      On Saturday the 18th
  of January I planted two hundred kernels of three different sam
 ples of barley, in separate pots filled with mould taken from a
 turnip-field (the turnips of which had been fed off bv sheep),
 which came in course for barley.     The kernels were not picked,
 but taken us they came to hand. The pots were placed in a hot
 bed  No. 1 was a sample of bright bailey, rather high coloured,
 having been got up dry, but partially wetted upon the stack be
 fore it was thatched.   This barley was sold at Harling market on
 the 21st of January at 29$. 6d. per coomb.  No. 2 was a sam
 ple of black barlev, of the quality of the black barley generally,
 this year sold at Diss market on the 24th of January at 12s. per
 coomb.  No. 3 was a sample of black barley, which had been still
 more exposed to the rain than No. 2.      I am not aware that any
part was grown barley.      On the eighth day from the sowing
 (Saturday the 25th of January) I examined the pots, and foumj
that of two hundred kernels sown in pot No. 1, one hundred and
three kernels appeared in a state of vegetation: of two hundred
kernels sown in pot 2, one kernel appeared in a state of vege
tation ; and of two hundred kernels sown in pot No. 3, two ker
nels appeared in a state of vegetation.      On the 15th day from
the sowing (on Saturday the 1st of February) I again examined
the pots, and found that of two hundred kernels sown in pot
No. 1, one hundred and ninety-seven kernels appeared in a state
of vegetation ; of two hundred kernels sown in pot No. 2, thirty
kernels appeared in a state of vegetation ; and of two hundred
kernels sown in pot No. 3, eighteen kernels appeared in a state
of vegetation.     The few plants which showed themselves in
Nos. 2 and 3 came up very irregularly, and looked unhealthy,
so much so, that it wai the opinion of those who examined them
with me, * that had not particular care been taken, and had the
barley been exposed to too much rain or drought, scarcely so
many would have vegetated.        On the twenty-second day from
the sowing (on Saturday the Sth of February) I examined the
pots for the third time, and found that of two hundred kernels
sown in pot No. 1, one hundred and ninety-seven kernels ap
peared in a state of vegetation ; of two hundred kernels, sown in
                                K4                              pot

pot No. 2, thirty-six kernels appeared in a state of vegetation ;
and of two hundred kernels sown in pot No. 3, nineteen kernels
appeared in a state of vegetation.   I hope this statement may
serve as a caution to such of you (and 1 understand the number
is very considerable) who are disposed to trust to the black bar
ley for seed ; or at least that your attention may be drawn to a
subject of so much importance to our county.        It is in the
power of every one of you to prove the correctness of this state
ment by making the same experiments.

which, though many of the facts have been stated in our pages, we
would willingly have given a place had it reached us in time; but
we did not receive it till the 24th February (and the publication
must be out by the 28th) . Independently of this, the publication to
which he has alluded does not appear to us to deserve the serious

 more tubes than one, or on apertures of any kind."
     COMPARATIVE TEMPERATURE                    OF   RAIN IN 1815 AND 1816.
         In the last number of the Bibliotheque Universelle                 there       is
the following curious comparison between the temperature of the
rain at Paris     the years 1815 and 1816.
                    in                        In 1815 the mean
temperature of the first ten months was = + 12-0° (centigrades),
   the year 18 16 was =+ 10-5°.

1816 It was    = 43 cent. 47.    The difference therefore in old
measures   corresponds  to two inches  five lines and seven tenths.
It is added that   in 1815 there  were   from January to October
inclusive, 127 days of rain ; and in 1 S 16 during the same space
of time eight days more.    In 1815 it rained twelve times in July;

   The Congo arrived at Spithead from Bahia on the 23d of
February, having brought home the whole of the crew that em
barked on the expedition to Africa, except one, who died at sea
of the flux. Mr. Lockhart, from the King's Garden at Kew,
and the serjeant of marines, were left at Bahia, not being con

                         CLARIFYING OF SUGAR.
   The Annates de Chimie xcv. 232, contains a notice, that a
Mons. Dorion having discovered that the bark of the pyramidal
ash, in powder, thrown into the boiling juice of the sugar-cane,
effects its clarification, the planters of Guadaloupe had given
him 100,000 francs, and those of Martinique a like sum, for
communicating his discovery; and that the English sugar planters
had bought the secret for 4000 francs.
  Dr. Thomson (Annals of Philosophy, No. 49), alluding             to
this notice, states, that he had learnt from a planter lately re
turned from the West Indies, that this process had been known
there for years; that the planter had himself employed      but never
                                                              it,
heard M. Dorion's name mentioned,              and"  quite sure that

                                             the English planters      is
not true."
   In the statement of Dr. Thomson's friend, as also          that of
                                                                in

                                  is
has not been before published in this country, we are happy in
being able to lay the following communication before our readers:

                                To  Mr.  Tilloch.
      Sir, In reference to the article in Dr. Thomson's Annals of
   Philosophy, last number, on the clarifying of the syrup of the
  sugar-cane, permit me to submit to you the pertinent remarks
  of an intelligent friend of mine lately returned from Jamaica.
  He was with Mons. Du Boc at the moment when he received, on
  the 13th of December 1815, the Kingston Gazette announcing
  the award of the House of Assembly noticed in the subjoined
  statement.
                            I always am, sir,
                                 Yours most obediently,
  Surry Institution,  Jan. 7, 1817.                         J.  MURRAY.
     " The    use  of the bark of the bastard cedar (a tree very com
  mon in all or most of the West Indian islands) was first intro
  duced in the purification of sugar by M.DuBoc, by birth a French
  man, and who had been a planter in the island of Martinique,
  where it appears he had with great success practised the use of
 it. M. Du Boc went to Jamaica in the early part of 1815, where
  he was patronized by several planters of eminence, to whom he
 individually explained his discovery.           The House of Assembly
 of Jamaica were so thoroughly convinced of the benefits accruing
 from this application of the bastard cedar bark, that in the month
 of October 1815 they voted him a thousand pounds sterling.
     " The process is extremely simple, and consists merely in the
 immersion of a few strips of the bark (peeled off a branch of
 the tree) in a bucket of water, and by squeezing the bark with
 the hand in a short time the water becomes gelatinous, and it
 is then thrown into the copper in which the sugar is boiling.
 Soon after this is thrown in, the surface of the boiling sugar is
 covered with a thick black seum, which consists of the solution
 of the bark intermixed with those impurities of the sugar which
the lime does not precipitate  that scum is removed with a
scummcr in a few minutes.            The sugar is afterwards drawn off
from the copper into the cooler, and is then considered as di
vested   of every impurity.
    "There grows also in Jamaica        a tree, the leaf of which used in
the same manner produces the like effects.               It is known in
Jamaica by the name of the Whangler or Wangla, but I know
not its specific or generic name."

    On the 17th of February, about nine in the morning, Mr.
Thomas Forster observed the chimney swallow (Hirundorustica)
flying about at Tunbridge Wells ; which accords with the notion
entertained      by some ornithologists,     that as these    birds some
                                                                     times

during the period of {.heir brumal disappearance.
                              AURORA BOREALIS.
    This phenomenon appeared again on Saturday night the Stli
inst. on which observations have, we understand, been made in
 London, at JDerby, Leeds and other places, and also at Paris.

   "On   Saturday the 8th inst. at seven o'clock we witnessed here a
fine display of the aurora borealis or northern lights. This singu
lar phenomenon continued without intermission for two hours,
during the whole of which time the skv was illuminated from the
horizon to the zenith, extending east and west for a considera
ble distance         Broad streaks of light of various sizes rose from
the horizon' in a pyramidical,           undulating form, and shot with
great velocity up        to the zenith  ; they changed their forms very
frequentlv and rapidly, and broke out in places where none were
seen before, shooting along the heavens, and then disappearing
in an instant. The sky in various places was tinged for a consi
derable space with a deep purple, and the stars shone very brightly
during the whole time through the clouds which formed the au
rora borealis.         A short time after this singular phenomenon had
ceased, the rain began to descend, and continued to do so most
of the night, though not violently."
    Among the many indications of an early spring, after nearly
a year of unusually wet and changeable weather, may be enu
merated the -early blowing of spring flowers.             On the 28th of
January the spring snow-flake and crocus were in full flower
in the neighbourhood          of Hackney,
                             SPEAKING TRUMPET.
    If the speaking trumpet used at sea had been made in any
other form than that of a parabolic conoid, it would have failed
greatly in its effect.        It is surprismg that this principle should
not have struck any one as the proper model for forming a trum
 pet for the collection of sound in cases of deafness.         Mr. Curtis
of Soho-square, aurist to his royal highness the Prince Regent,
 has with much advantage applied this principle to a late contri
 vance, and employed the instrument with great success in a num
 ber of cases of deafness : the same gentleman has also improved
 the French invention of artificial ears, by giving them great
 power in the collection and transmission of sound.

   XL.   On the Agency of the Carbonate of Magnesia in improving
     Bread made from the new Flour. By Edmund Davy, Esq.
     Professor of Chemistry , and Secretary to the Corklnstitulion.
                               To Mr. Tilhch.
  Dear Sir,  J.N T a recent
                                   communication*, I stated that new
  seconds flour, of indifferent or bad quality, is materially improved
  for the purpose of making bread, when the common carbonate
 ,of magnesia is well mixed with it in the proportion of from 20
  to 40 grains to a pound of flour.
     Since I announced this fact, I have made a number of com
 parative experiments on the worst seconds flour I could procure,
 with and without the addition of the magnesia; and the results
 have uniformly been satisfactory.         The efficacy of this substance
 has also been repeatedly proved by trials made in Cork, and in
 different parts both of Ireland and England.
     In a few cases, however, it has been said, the magnesia failed
 to produce the desired effect on the new flour; at which I am
 not surprised ; for to my knowledge the calcined magnesia has
 in some instances been used instead of the common carbonate,
 and there is too -much reason to apprehend this last substance
 has in other cases been adulterated by admixture with foreign
 bodies.     In an early stage of my experiments, I found the cal
 cined magnesia (when used in the quantity of from 20 to 30
 grains to a pound of flour) to injure the colour of the bread and
 to render it heavy : and in the proportion of 40 grains to a
 pound it even changed the colour of the dough, and made it as
 sume a yellow hue, not unlike that tint imparted by saffron. In
 the proportion of 12 grains to a pound of flour, however, the
 calcined magnesia improved the bread, but not nearly to the
 same extent as the carbonate.
    There certainly may exist a difference of opinion as to the
quantity of improvement effected in the bread by the magnesia.
Slight circumstances, by no means easy to appreciate, may in
different cases materially alter the nature of results.        But no one
who    has fairly  tried the    magnesia,   in the  way   I have  recom
mended, can hesitate to admit the fact.          1 venture  to speak con
fidently from experience.         I do it under the full conviction that,
whilst too -much caution cannot be exercised in drawing con
clusions from one or two hasty trials, the most legitimate in
ferences may be deduced from experiments carefully made and
frequently repeated.
    In the communication to which I have alluded, I merely
hinted at the probable agency of the magnesia in correcting the
bad qualities of the new flour. I now beg leave to notice the cir-
                   * See Pliil. Mag. for December
           ..                                      1816,.
Vol. 49. No.227. March 1817.                     L             cumstances

  1 62        On the Agency     of the  Carbonate  of Magnesia
  cumstances that led me to use this substance, and to bring fof-
. ward some facts that tend to elucidate the mode of its operation.
      On examining several samples of new wheat, it appeared to
  me the injury they had sustained arose principally from the grain
  having germinated.         In this process it is understood a part of
  the farinaceous matter of the grain is converted into sugar.
  The changes thus produced in the grain seem to be analogous to
   those effected in starch by diluted sulphuric acid and heat : only
  iu the one case they result from chcmieal agencies alone ; in
   the other, the chemical agencies are assisted by the living powers
  of the infant plant.      The production of saccharine matter in the
  grain is conceived to be accompanied by an incipient fermenta
   tion : this, though checked in the act of drying the corn, might,
   in the subsequent operations to which the flour was exposed
   when made into dough and baked, induce the acetous fermen
   tation.     Hence, I thought it not improbable that acid matter
   might be developed in bread made from the new flour with the
   Usual additions.
       In order to try  if the new flour was at all acid,     I put samples
   of the worst quality in distilled water ; but a.fter several hours
   the fluid did not affect litmus paper, or the still more delicate
   test of an infusion of red cabbage.            I likewise exposed fer
   mented dough made from the same flour (with the additions of
  yeast, salt, and warm water,) to an infusion of cabbage ; but no
   change of colour could be perceived in it.            But after some of
   the dough     had been   baked,    the  bread  was  clammy, had a sin
   gular smell, a sourish taste, and left on the palate a sense of
   bitterness,    When some of this bread was put in distilled water
   and suffered to remain for about a day, the fluid produced a
   slight tint of red in an infusion of cabbage; and after three days it
   had a slight acid taste, and perceptibly reddened litmus paper.
   On making a comparative trial with bread made from good old
   flour, under similar circumstances, I could not by the most de
   licate tests detect the presence of any acid.           Hence it seemed
   acid matter was formed in the baking of the new flour, and the
   bread had a tendency to acidity.            I found likewise, in cases
   when a    few  drops  of vinegar,   or any of the mineral acids diluted,
   were put into dough made from good old flour, the bread was
   disposed to be clammy, and had a taste similar to that of bread
   made from bad new flour.          These circumstances led me to ima
   gine   that  the bad   qualities  of bread made from the new flour
   were connected with the appearance of acid matter during the
  baking : and the application of alkaline substances, as cor
   rectives, immediately became obvious.           After repeated trials, I
   found that the fixed, and volatile alkalies, their subcarbonates
  and carbonates, improved the new flour to a certain extent; and
                                                                      I was

           in improving Bread made from the new Flour.             163
 I  was  in consequence led to try the effects of the common car
bonate of magnesia, a substance well known to be slightly al
kaline. The trial was attended with perfect success ; the im
provement by the subcarbonate of magnesia was greater than by
any of the other alkaline bodies.
     The carbonate of magnesia, I conceived, might act on the
bread in two ways : chemically and mechanically.         Chemically,
by correcting its tendency to acidity ;  mechanically, by im
 proving its texture.     I did not think it necessary to enter into
 an elaborate analysis of the bread, in order to ascertain how far
 my views were correct ; yet my experiments, some of which I
 shall give in detail, have perhaps been sufficiently minute to
throw some light on the inquiry.
     Carbonate of magnesia, I found, improved the colour of bread
 made from new seconds flour, whilst it impaired the colour of
bread from fine old and new flour.       This circumstance favoured
the idea of its chemical action; for, if it were passive, it was in
conceivable that a substance so perfectly white could in the
slightest degree injure the colour of the whitest flour.      1 made
the following experiments on bread from new seconds flour of
bad quality, containing the carbonate of magnesia in the quantity
of from 30 to 40 grains to a pound of flour.
     1 burnt two ounces of the bread in a Hessian crucible, at a
low heat, until it became like a cinder ; the temperature was
 then raised to a dull red ; and after twenty minutes the black
 mass was partially covered with a light white substance, which,
 on trial, readily dissolved in diluted sulphuric acid with efferve
scence, and gave a white precipitate with carbonate of ammonia.
The heat was continued until all the carbonaceous matter had
 disappeared, and there remained at the bottom of the crucible
 a small quantity of a white earthy-like substance.      It had a sa
 line taste, partially dissolved in water, and readily with efferve
 scence in sulphuric acid.      It was principally common salt used
 in the bread, and carbonate of magnesia.         The preceding ex
periments were repeated with similar results.
     1 crumbled two ounces of the soft of the bread, and put it into
 a pint of distilled water.      After remaining about twentv-four
 hours, the   fluid was passed through a filter.    (It was of a little
 darker colour than the fluid furnished by bread made from new
 or old flour aloue.)    It had an agreeable taste, and did not affect
 the colour of litmus.     When the fluid was treated with a solution
 of subcarbonate of ammonia, a light flocculent precipitate soon
  made its appearance ; it was immediately redissolved with ef
 fervescence by a few drops of sulphuric acid.
     When a half pint of the fluid was boiled down nearlv to dry
 ness, and gently heated with strong sulphuric acid, there was a
                                   L 2                         violent

 164       On the Agency    of the Carbonate of Magnesia
 violent action, and fumes of acetic acid apparently mixed with a
 little muriatic acid were disengaged.      The excess of sulphuric
 acid being expelled by heat, distilled water was added, and the
 solution filtered.    On treating it with carbonate of ammonia,
.there was a copious light flocculent precipitate, which on further
 examination proved to becarbonate of magnesia.             A further
 quantity of the original infusion of the bread was boiled down
 to dryness in a platinum crucible ; it appeared to be principally
 mucilage.     On being exposed to the atmosphere for a few hours,
 it slightly deliquesced ; and when treated with strong sulphuric
 acid and carbonate of ammonia, the results were similar to those
 noticed above.
      On two ounces of fresh bread a half pint of distilled water
 was poured.      After remaining about twenty hours, the infusion
 was decanted, and boilr-d down to about 1-1 2th of its original
 volume.     It was put into a tubulated retort with a little strong
 sulphuric acid, and a heat below the boiling point of the acid
 was applied for half an hour.     The neck of the retort was placed
 in a glass containing a half cubic inch of pure water.     A colour
 less fluid came over, which had a peculiar empyreumatic odour,
  a very slight acid taste, and reddened litmus paper.      This fluid
 was neutralized by caustic potash, and evaporated to dryness.
 The dry mass was treated with a slight excess of strong sulphuric
 acid; and on being gently heated very pungent fumes, principally
 of acetic acid, were disengaged. An infusion of bread containing
 no carbonate of magnesia, on being treated with carbonate of
  ammonia gave no precipitate.       A half pint of such an infusion
  after being evaporated to dryness, and heated to redness for some
 time, yielded a little white substance, which appeared to have
 undergone fusion.      It was soluble in water, gave no precipitate
 with the carbonates of potash and ammonia, but a copious one
 with nitrate and nitrate of barytes, and was merely the common
 salt used in the bread.
      The foregoing experiments appear to sanction the conclusion,
  that when the carbonate of magnesia is mixed in certain quan
  tities with the new flour, the magnesia acts chemically on the
 bread in the act of baking.      One portion of it is decomposed by
  the acetic acid e formed : the other part remains in its original
  state.   The disengagement of the carbonic acid gas from the
  decomposed carbonate, may perhaps tend to increase the light
  ness and porosity of the bread.
      As the new flour appears to contain an excess of gluten, a very
  tenacious substance, (on account of a portion of the farina of the
 wheat having been converted into saccharine matter,) the unde-
  compounded carbonate in the bread may exert a mechanical
  agency on the gluten in the dough; and by lessening its cohesive
                                                            property,

             in improving Bread made from the new Flour.              165
property, it may improve the texture of the bread, in a manner
somewhat analogous to the improvement of stiff clay soils by
the mechanical agency of sand or gravel.
    Bread made from the new flour with the addition of carbonate
of magnesia is much lighter and more porous than when made
without it. I have at different times made loaves with and with
out the magnesia, using equal weights of the materials, and I
have always found the magnesian loaves of much larger size.
And I may further add {cceterh paribus), not only is the relative
bulk of the bread increased by the use of magnesia ; its actual
weight is likewise greater.         Magnesia appears to give to the
new flour a greater capacity for water.         For example : seventeen
ounces of new seconds, containing forty grains of magnesia, re
quired eleven ounces of water at the temperature of SO3 Fahr. to
make it into dough ; but ten ounces at the same heat were suf
ficient for sixteen ounces of the flour.         There was also a pro
portional increase in the weight of the bread.           The loaf with
magnesia (after making the necessary allowances) weighed 200
grains more than the one without it.            Carbonate of magnesia,
by giving bread the power of fixing an additional quantity of vo
latile materials, seems to act not unlike chalks or marles, when
applied on a sandstone or gravelly soil ; they increase its power
 of absorbing and retaining moisture.
    The facts I have stated must, I should think, tend to obviate
 any objection against the use of small quantities of magnesia in
 bread, from the fear of its accumulation in the system, on ac
 count of its supposed insolubility.      As cold water readily dissolves
 the new magnesian salt formed in the bread, the fluids of the
 stomach, it may be presumed, will be much more effectual sol
 vents of that substance.
    There is one circumstance that deserves mention, and with
 the notice of which I shall close the present communication.            I
think I have ascertained the existence of the prussic acid in bread
made from the new flour*.           My opinion rests on the fact, that
in the preceding experiments, when the strong sulphuric acid
was added to infusions of the bread evaporated to dryness, or
nearly so, the peculiar peach-blossom odour of the prussic acid
became more or less perceptible on a gentle application of heat.
 I do not conceive the appearance of this acid can be referred to
 any changes effected in the vegetable matter by the agency of
 the sulphuric acid, as the prussic odour was clearly perceived in
 cases when the sulphuric acid was in a very diluted state.
    * From an
                 experiment I made with bread made from good old flour,  I
 am   inclined to believe it also contained the prussic acid, but in much
 smaller quantity than the bread from new flour.

XLI.        On alloying Iron with Manganese.                 By David MusheTj
                       Esq.   of   Coleford,   Forest    of   Dean.
                              ,    To   Mr. Tillock.
Dear Sir,  iTiie       general result of my two last communications
showed that there existed           difficulty
                                        a          combining to any con
                                                    in
siderable amount the metal of manganese with that of iron,
either       the fusion of cast-iron with the ore of manganese, or
             by
by  the fusion of the ores of both metals.             Nothing favourable
to practical result in the blast-furnace could be inferred, par-i
    a
ticularly    if   were necessary to unite manganese to the extent
                  it
of 20 or 30 per cent, with the metal of iron for any particular
object of manufacture.             was however remarked,
                                    It                            that while
the metallic results or buttons were obedient to the magnet, some
minute spherules of metal were obtained, over which                  had noit
influence.       therefore concluded that the difficulty arose from
                 I
a  defective mode of operation, and that those circumstances ne-.
cessary to produce de-oxidation and reduction in ores of iron
were not sufficient to produce               similar effect when an ore
                                               a
of manganese was operated upon. In the blast-furnace as well
as in the assay-furnace previous de-oxidation                  necessary to
                                                                  is
metallic   reduction.     In  the former this       completely effected
                                                        is                        by
a  process of cementation which takes place in the upper regions
of the furnace.       In the latter, the fusion being more rapid, the
effect      generally produced by the presence of a quantity of
            is
carbonaceous matter in the mixture.                  the crucible
                                                        If            formed
                                                                           is
of mixture of clay and this latter substance, the fusion will ad^
    a
init of more rapid progress, and the oxidation and reduction
            a
will be more completely effected. Hence in the reduction of
ores of iron in crucibles formed of clay and blacklead, metallic
masses of iron may be obtained so highly saturated with car
buret of iron as to destroy metallic weight and compactness                       ;
 under such circumstances the most perfect de-oxidation takes
place no vestige of iron remains unrevived, or the slightest trace
        ;
of its oxide in the glass. Considering the use of such crucibles
 favourable to the reduction of manganese,               determined on at

than I had hitherto found practicable.          I made use of the same
ores formerly mentioned : the fluxes were chalk and window-
glass ; the latter I preferred to an argillaceous earth, which, so
far as it regards reduction, answers equally well, but does not
exhibit so transparent a glass when the results are perfect or
approaching thereto.

    This mixture was perfectlv reduced, though the glass indica
 ted by its depth of green a portion of oxide still unrevived.
 The metallic button was smooth, its fracture and quality those
 of the finest or most carbonated cast-iron : weight 30 grains,
 equal to 471 Per cent.      The same experiment repeated under
 a less rapid fusion yielded 50 per .cent, of iron.        When equal
 quantities of chalk and glass were used, a carburetted metallic
 button was obtained equal to 50j per cent.

 magnetic.    The whole weighed 276 grains, which is equal to
        Per cent.    If the produce of the ore is taken at 50,
which is near truth, then an alloy of metallic manganese of
nearly 5£ parts with 50 of iron was formed  a higher combina
tion than any hitherto obtained in these experiments : the in
crease of metallic weight beyond a produce of 50 per cent, is
26 grains.    This being obtained from 200 grains of manganese,
is a produce from this ore of only 13 per cent. A slight diminu

glass was not, as in No. 4, covered with shining carburet, but
with a rough cream-coloured porcelain minutely punctured and
in some instances crystallized.       Beneath, a transparent smoky-
coloured   glass was found, very different from common assay-

   From the fusion of this mixture a singularly composed glass
appeared: the surface was stony, of a whitish colour, covering a
stratum of similarly coloured porcelain.        Beneath a fine trans
parent glass interspersed with circular concretions of crystallized
porcelain, only two grains of shining carburet were found un
acted upon.     The metallic button and globules were equally
shining and carburetted with the former experiments, and weighed
318 grains ; which is a produce of 63~fi0 per cent, from the iron
ore ; which being a gain of 68 grains of metal beyond the assay
produce of the iron ore, makes the yield of 400 grains of man
ganese equal to 17 per cent.        This metallic alloy will therefore

turned out in a solid conical form, of a brownish copper colour ;

     On withdrawing     this crucible  from the    furnace     and  removing
 the cover its contents were found in a state of the most perfect
 fluidity. The cover was restored, and I went to call a friend to
 witness the expected decomposition.         On our return to the la
boratory (within five minutes from the time the crucible was
 taken from the furnace) we found it burst into pieces, and the
 whole contents heaped up in a state of fine powder, which as it
 cooled exhibited several metallic shades. A metallic button with
 a rough surface, but highly carburetted, was found in the pow
 dery matter : this with some globules weighed 320 grains, so that
 a considerable diminution of produce was here experienced ; from
 which it was inferred that the alloy of manganese with iron hail
 in the last experiment reached its maximum under the circum
 stances and proportion of mixtures now used.
     I was now satisfied that ores of manganese might be smelted
 with success along with our common argillaceous ironstone in the
 blast-furnace, with a considerable augmentation of metallic pro
 duce, and much pleased to have discovered the fact that iron al
 loyed with manganese in certain proportions ceases to be obedient
 to the magnet.       This fact alone renders it extremely probable
 that   the presence of manganese is not essential to the formation
 of good steel, and that those irons analysed by Bergman contain
 no notable quantity, seeing that the strongest and most durable
 magnets are made of steel manufactured from such iron.

 fully obedient to the magnet.
     Nos. 2 and 3. As relates to fracture, were fully more carbo
 nated than the former; and though 100 grains of manganese
had been fused in the mixture, the quality of the iron was soft
and easily filed.     No diminution of magnetic force was percep
 tible.
     No. 4.    The fracture of this latter was materially different from
 the three former.      The grain or crystal was smaller, the colour
 lighter, and considerably harder under the file; the globules were
 attracted by the magnet, but they approached with less force,
 and perceptibly indicated a diminution of this action.
      No. 5. The present fracture as to grain was similar to the
 last, with the exception of two distinct white lines running pa.-
 rallel with the under surface of the metallic button.         Magnetic
 force considerably diminished.
      No. 6. The fracture of this result was regularly mottled on a
 white ground; the file had little or no impression; a magnet of
 the power of 20 pounds did not lift a globule of ISO grains.
      No. 7. Fracture similar to No. 6, with the exception of an
 edging of gray minutely crystallized : the smallest globules were
 not in the least acted upon.
     -No. 8 and 9. Presented white silvery fractures, and so ex
  tremely brittle as to pound readily in an iron mortar, which in
  dicates a quality very different from white fractured cast-iron.
  No part of the metallic results of these experiments was in the
  least acted upon by the magnet.           One striking anomaly ap
  peared throughout : The alloyed buttons after the addition of
  the ore of manganese presented surfaces covered with the most
  shining carburet of iron common at iron-foundries; and this ef
  fect seemed rather to increase as the quantity of manganese was
  enlarged and the carbonation of the fracture decreased,  a cir
  cumstance totally unknown in the fusion of simple ores of iron.

      P. S. Your last number contained      an interesting account of a
   mass   of native iron found in South America, which I suppose is
   the same alluded to in chemical and mineralogical books within
  the last twenty years.     On reading the account, I was peculiarly
   struck with its resemblance to those masses of iron sometimes
  formed in the bottoms of our blast-furnaces in this country.

 172       Method    of preserving Lime fit for Mortar, (Sc.
Many of these are nearly metallic, and weigh from ten to thirty
thousand pounds.        From such a mass I have lately seen speci
mens perfectly similar (judging from description) to those ob
tained from the American mass of native iron, and which were
capable of being extended under the hammer.          The circumstance
of the Brazilian mass being found where       the surrounding country
is covered with a substance resembling an ore of iron is extremely
curious.     Those who have a difficulty in believing the descent of
such mighty masses of matter from the atmosphere, might find
pleasure by inquiring as to the probability of these metallic ac
cumulations being the products of ancient metallurgical opera
tions; and whether the plentiful diffusion of iron ore in their im
mediate neighbourhood is not the scoria surcharged with iron
that had been evolved in the progress of these, perhaps ante
diluvian, manipulations.

                             To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,  Observing           with pleasure the readiness with which
you insert in your useful Miscellany any information that may
be useful, I send you the process employed in this part of the
world for preserving lime.       Those of your readers who have oc
casion   to use lime  must know, that when suffered to slack by the
moisture of the atmosphere it at the same time imbibes car
bonic acid, and after a time returns to the state of unburnt lime.
If made up into mortar to be kept in a heap, it undergoes, though
more slowly, the same change ; and when not quite destroyed
is found to have lost much of its binding quality, by the mixture
of the outer dead part of the mass with the lime in the interior of
the mass. All those evils may be avoided by the German pro
cess, which I doubt not will prove acceptable to many of your
readers.     I am, &e.

                              To       Mr.   Tilloch.
 Dear Sir,  The subject on which                    I     recently addressed you*
 has since occupied my attention.            I    have extended my researches,
 and selected from previous inquiries such observations and ex
 periments as were unnoticed in my late communication.
    It appears to be an indisputable fact, that the average quality
 of the last year's wheat    very inferior to that of former years.
                              is

   174     Observations on the Changes produced in the new          Ifheal j
  cumstances under which the crops ripened or were saved in the
  late unpropitious harvest.          Every attempt, therefore, to improve
  the new      flour for  the   purpose of making bread, ought to be
  founded on some previous knowledge of the injury the wheat
  had sustained.       The hope of being able to correct the bad qua
  lities of the flour, induced me more than two months ago to
  turn my leisure moments to the subject. 1 entered on the investi
  gation with some preliminary experiments on the new wheat and
  flour.     I examined several samples of new wheat : they had all
  to a certain extent undergone the process of germination or inci
  pient vegetation.       In some cases the germen had protruded from
  about 1-1 Oth to 5-10ths of an inch, and the radicle from about
   1-1 0th to above an inch in length.           These were, it is true, the
   very   worst  samples   I could   procure.    I likewise examined several
  specimens       of wheat    from    different parts of this county, of a
  quality far superior to those I have mentioned ; but in all of them
- it was discoverable on a minute inspection that a slight and
   partial germination had taken place.            And I have been given to
   understand, that the average wheat of the country has suffered
   more or less in this way.          Some crops germinated before they
   were ready      for the   sickle, and others after they were cut down
   and made up into sheaves.
       As the natural germination of the wheat appeared to be similar
   to that effected by artificial means, in the malting of barley, in
   which a portion of the farinaceous part of the grain is converted
   into saccharine matter, I made some experiments with a view
   to ascertain how far this' opinion was well founded.              I placed
   different samples of new wheat in tin dishes, and thoroughly
   dried them on a hot iron plate.            The grain had a sweetish taste
   resembling malt, and afforded with warm water an infusion
   which when boiled down nearly to dryness had a sweet taste,
   and consisted of saccharine and mucilaginous matter.
       I mixed some new seconds flour of bad quality with distilled
   water. After about forty hours the fluid was passed through a
   filter.   The solution had a slight sweetish taste ; on being boiled
   a little albumen coagulated, and after the fluid was evaporated
   to 1-1 4th of its original volume, the residual liquor was quite
   sweet to the taste, and consisted of mucilage and sugar.                On
   making comparative
              a                 trial  with  good  old  flour, the quantity of
   saccharine matter obtained was, in proportion, very inconsider
    able.
       I. made bread with the new seconds flour, warm water, and
    yeast, without any salt.         Some of the bread was put in distilled
    water for twenty-four hours; the clear fluid was then decanted
  -and boiled down nearly to dryness.                 The residual liquor wis
    sweet.      It was further evaporated and digested in warm alcohol.

               and on the Mearis  of improving   the Flour.        1 75
The sugar was dissolved by the spirit, and there remained             a
white substance which dissolved in cold water, and was princi
pally mucilage.      The spirituous solution was boiled to dryness,
and the sugar remained.        It tasted of the spirit, and was ako
mixed with a little mucilage.
     From these trials it seemed probable that the bad qualities
of the new flour were connected with the production of saccha
rine matter in the grain ; and this opinion acquired additional
evidence from the following experiments.
     I made two small loaves; each contained half a pound of the
best old flour and the same quantity of yeast and salt.        In fact,
they were in every respect similar, with the exception that one
contained 100 grains of soft sugar.        Before they were baked, it
was observed that the dough with the sugar was not quite so
 light, it had not apparently fermented so well as the other. The
loaves after being taken from the oven and suffered to cool were
 examined:       The loaf without sugar appeared to have all the
requisites of excellent bread.      The property of elasticity it pos
sessed in a high decree.       When the soft part of the bread was
pressed ever so much by the finger, it immediately regained its
former situation without leaving any impression behind.            The
 loaf with sugar had a bitter taste, and especially the crust of it.
 It was rather disposed to be clammy. It was not nearly so elastic
 as the bread without sugar.       When pressed on by the finger it
slowly recovered its situation, but the impression was left behind.
 The colour of the bread with the sugar was also a little impaired.
  I made a similar trial with good old American flour, and the re
 sults corresponded very nearly with those detailed ; the bread with
 sugar had a bitter taste, and slightly adhered to the teeth ; whilst
  the bread without sugar was excellent, and did not possess those
  properties in any degree. As an infusion (of the bread containing
 sugar) in cold water had a sweetish taste and did not affect lit
  mus paper, it is likely a part at least of the sugar remained un
  altered in the bread.
      From these experiments it would appear, that the quality of
  bread made from good flour, with the usual additions, is impaired
  by sugar ; as the dough with sugar did not rise quite so well,
   nor was the bread so light as without sugar.      I should conceive
   this substance tended rather to check than to accelerate fer
   mentation in such circumstances.       A certain portion of saccha
   rine matter seems essential to the panary fermentation.        Good
   wheat appears to possess the requisite quantity, which, if it be
   increased by artificial or natural means  whether it be simply
   added to the flour, or produced by the germination of the grain,
   still it seems to act by retarding the fermentation requisite to
  produce good bread, or bread in its greatest perfection. The case

 176 Observations on the Changes produced in the new            Wheal;
is somewhat similar with preserved fruits beginning to undergo
 the acetous fermentation ; when they are heated with more sugar,
 this process is checked, and all further chemical changes are sus
 pended.     Common salt and other saline substances, as is well
 known, are powerful antiseptics when used in quantity, but when
  employed in small proportion they promote putrefaction.         Sugar
 ?n a  similar  way  appears to retard or  promote   fermentation.
    The efficacy of the method recommended by Mr. Hatchett of
 improving damaged and musty corn, by exposing it to the agency
 of hot water, may in part depend upon its dissolving out a por
 tion of the saccharine as well as the musty matter of the grain.
    The means recommended to improve the new flour for making
 bread, are 1. By drying the flour.      2. By mixing with the flour
 or the dough some innocent and cheap material.              The flour
 may   be  dried  either slowly, by exposing a large      surface  of it
 before the fire for several hours, and occasionally turning it over;
 or rapidly in an oven, or by the agency of steam. With a view
 to ascertain the most efficient mode of drying the flour, I made
 the following experiments on new seconds of bad quality.
    Exp. 1.  One pound of flour in a shallow tin dish was placed
 before the fire, and occasionally turned over.      After twenty-four
 hours it lost one ounce in weight.       The bread from it was of a
 better colour, lighter, and rather better-tasted than the flour
 would have furnished before it was dried.      Still, however, it had
 a disagreeable taste, which was effectually corrected by the car
 bonate of magnesia, when used in the proportion of thirty grains
 to a pound of the flour.
    Exp. 2.  One pound of flour in a tin dish was placed on an iron
plate for eight hours, at a temperature varying from about 200°
to 230°.     It lost two ounces in weight.     The bread from it was
not improved, but heavy, clammy, and of a bad colour.
    Exp. 3.  One pound of flour in a dish was put into the oven
 and exposed to a temperature varying from about 212° to 250J
for three hours ; it lost nearly an ounce in weight.        The bread
from it was very little better than that of the preceding experi
ment.
    To ascertain whether the flour, by being slowly dried, lost any
thing besides moisture, I put two ounces of it into a tubulated
retort, placed the neck of the retort in a little distilled water,
and exposed the retort to the temperature of about 90° for some
time. A little fluid came over. It was colourless and insipid, and
did not affect litmus or turmeric paper ; and left no residuum
on being evaporated to dryness. Hence it appeared to be only
water. These experiments seem to favour the opinion that the
advantages resulting from drying the flour are best secured by
carrying on this process in a slow and gradual manner.         And as

               and on ike Means    of improving   the   Flour.       177
the new flour in the act of drying appears to lose nothing but
water, and after being well dried it still makes bread of indiffe
rent quality, the process of drying can only be regarded as a
useful auxiliary, and by no means supersedes the application of
other substances as correctives.    1 have said a moderate warmth,
long continued, seems     to improve the flour more than a higher
temperature.      This difference may probably arise from various
considerations.    As sugar appears to be injurious to flour, and
the new flour contains an excess of saccharine matter, and is in
a comparatively moist state ; a low temperature is most favour
able to incipient fermentation, by which process the excess of
sweet matter in the flour may be changed into vinous spirit and
be dissipated in drying.      My experiments have been too limited
to enable me to speak accurately concerning the relations of the
flour dried in different ways, to water.      I obtained one result
that was rather unexpected:  I shall state the experiment, but
as 1 had not an opportunity of repeating it 1 shall decline all com
ment on it.     I dried eleven ounces of bad new flour on a hot
hearth ; in six hours it had lost nearly two ounces.      I made the
dry flour up into dough, but found that it required less water for
this purpose than an equal weight of the undried flour.
   The principal substances employed to improve the new flour
for bread appear to be the alkalies and their compounds, and the
subcarbonate of magnesia; and I pressume they have been found
more efficacious in this way, than any bodies that have yet been
tried.
   In my former communications I have recommended the use
of the subcarbonate of magnesia, and endeavoured to point out'
its agency when employed in bread.         I shall now briefly state
some comparative experiments I made, which led me to recom
mend magnesia in preference to any of the other alkaline sub
stances.   I made fourteen small loaves of the new seconds flour
of bad quality : each loaf contained half a pound of flour and
nearly the same quantity of yeast, salt, and warm water.
No.   1.   Loaf containing only the above substances  ; quite heavy
         and so clammy as readily to adhere to a knife and the
         fingers ;  bad tasted.
      2. Loaf  with ten grains of subcarbonate of ammonia in so
         lution ;  Lighter and better tasted than No. 1 . but rather
           clammy.
      3. Loaf with twenty grains stick potash (kali purum);- Bet
         ter than No.   1.,
                          but not so good as No. 2.

         No. I ; quite viscous, adhering to the teeth.
     9. Loaf with forty grains ditto;  Better than No. 8, but in
          ferior to No. 2.
   10. Loaf with ten grains pearlash      ;  Improved,  but not mate
          rially.
   11. Loaf twenty grains ditto ;  Tolerably good, scarcely in
          ferior to No. 2.
   12. Loaf with little pure ammonia;  Scarcely improved,
          clammy, and bad tasted.
   13. Loaf with twenty grains of subcarbonate of magnesia; 
          Very much improved ; better than any of the preceding,
          light and porous,good tasted, and not in the least clammy.
   14. Loaf fifteen grains ditto;  Scarcely inferior to No. 13.
   When the new flour is well dried, and the subcarbonate mag
nesia mixed with it in the quantity of thirty grains to a pound
of flour ; good bread may be made from such flour with the
addition of 1-Sth or 1 -6th of boiled parsnips, or of baked or
boiled potatoes.        Baked potatoes seem to answer better than
boiled   ones   ; they  are  drier, and more mealy.
   Bread made from the new flour of indifferent or bad quality
has a disagreeable smell and taste, is disposed to be heavy and
clammy, and has its colour impaired.           The disagreeable smell
 and taste of the bread seem to be connected with the presence
of an excess of saccharine matter in the flour, and the subse
 quent changes it undergoes in the process of baking.         The ap
plication of the alkaline bodies is explained on the idea that the
bread has a tendency to acidity, which is counteracted by their
presence ; or they neutralize any acid formed, and thus materially
improve the bread.
   From a comparative trial 1 made, it would appear that the
new flour contains a larger proportion of gluten, but less farina,
than the old flour.         As the gluten of wheat is a very tenacious
and adhesive substance, and of a dull gray colour, and farina of
a white colour ; and as the former is in excess, and the latter in
 deficiency, in the new flour ;  these circumstances may in some
 measure serve to explain why the bread is disposed to be clammy
 and of a darker colour than is usually the case.

180       New Theorems              for   determining         the Rate      of Interest,
   As the operation of constructing tables of the amount and
present value of one pound annuity for any given term is not
very commodiously performed, according to the common me
thod, I shall in this place show how it may be effected in a much
easier manner.
   Let A. A' denote the amount of an annuity for n and n+l
years respectively;           then      A equal              , and hence        A'= (A X 1 +
r+1).
    If,
      again, the same letters be made to denote the present
value of an annuity of 1/. per annum, we shall similarly have
                            A+1
A'xl r-l=Aand
          +                             A'=
                                              l+r
    In this way may           we examine and extend the tables at pleasure;
and the amount or present value of 1/. corresponding                                        to the
                                                                                    is by
like or any other term of years, will then be obtained      simple
subtraction only    and thus a process otherwise tedious

 I    come now to the determination of the rate of interest in
annuities;     subject that has engaged the attention of -some of
                   a
the greatest mathematicians that ever lived.     Various formule
have been devised for this purpose, most of which give the value
sufficiently exact, when the number of years       not very great;     is
but in this latter case no dependence can be placed upon the
result, and at times the formulae wholly fail.     Those which                                  I
have to propose are the following    to which     annexed an ex

   In these two instances, selected promiscuously, it will be seen
that the formula is rather erroneous in point of excess ; and this
in general will be the case when there is much difference be
tween the assumed rates : hence, under such circumstances, if
the rate appears to consist of an integer and some even frac
tional quantity, we may properly take such rate, and fractional
part or that nearest           it,
                        for the exact rate per cent., rejecting all
the succeeding decimal places.
   But this    not necessary; since from the tables we can always
                   is
deduce approximate rates nearer than those above, and the value
of thereby will in every case be rendered extremely correct.

    In computations relating to subjects of this nature, it often
becomes necessary to determine the time when a given sum at
an assigned rate will double itself at compound interest ; or, the
time being known, to determine the ratio of the rate.                   In this
case we derive from the equation                   = log   1 + r, but    r  may

 XLV.    Some Account      of the Solar      Spots tvhich appeared during
rp                            the  Year     1816*.
 JL he following observations were made in consequence of a
report very generally circulated during the summer of 1S16,
 that the solar spots were, at that time, more numerous than
usual, and of extraordinary size.            Many persons connecting this
circumstance with the state of the atmosphere, conceived that
the w^t and cold season, which proved so injurious to the har
vest, was in a great measure caused by the interruption of the
sun's rays by these opaque parts, which were supposed to occupy
an extensive portion of its disk.             Such an opinion is at first
sight sufficiently plausible to attract the attention of those un
accustomed to observe the appearances presented by the solar
macule ; and some statements which were made in the Philo
sophical Transactions of London for the year 1801 have long
since tended to give this opinion universal publicity.                Not, in
deed, from any important facts which were then newly disclosed,
nor from reasoning founded upon them ; but from an amusing
conclusion which was drawn :  " that the price of wheat in
Windsor market was in some degree connected with the spots
in the sun."      The humour of this result spread abroad by the
newspapers, precluded all reasoning; and although the truly
profound astronomer speedily retracted his theory, it was too late
to recall the whimsical antithesis which had already caused the
wise and the ignorant alike to smile f.

   'In regard to the spots which appeared on the sun during the
last year (1816) it may be remarked, that two which passed
over the disk in September were the largest which occurred.
Their situation and form are given in No. 1, (Plate 111.) as they
were seen on the 16th of the above month.           They were each sur
rounded by an umbra, and preserved nearly the same relative
position, with respect to each other, during their progress over
 the disk ; their course being parallel with and near to the sun's
equator.      The larger of the two occupied about l-25th part of
the sun's diameter.
   As these macule were very distinctly marked with an opaque
centre, encompassed by an umbra and of considerable magni
tude, they afforded a good opportunity of comparing their ap
pearance with the theory about forty years since advanced by
Dr. Wilson the astronomer of Glasgow.               He conceived these
macula; to consist of vast cavities in the substance of the sun ;
that the dark nucleus in the middle was the bottom or deep part
of the cavity ; and that the nebulous circle or umbra was pro
duced by light faintly reflected from the sloping sides for some
depth below the orifice.         In support of this theory- the Doctor
observed, that when a spot accompanied by an umbra entered
the limb of the sun, the dark nucleus always appeared close to
that side of the umbra which was nearest the sun's centre; but
as the spot advanced towards the middle of the disk, the breadth
of the umbra gradually enlarged, till the nucleus seemed uni
formly surrounded by it.         Having passed the centre, the breadth
of the umbra began to contract, on that side next the middle of
the sun, till it reached the opposite limb, in which situation the
nucleus seemed to touch the edge of the umbra as before, pre
senting through its course, in a reversed order, the same grada
tion exhibited while advancing towards the centre.
   The appearances, however, which attended the spots in Sep
tember last, did not correspond with the phenomena observed
by Dr. Wilson. The writer of this, bearing in mind the above
theory, could not discover that the nucleus ever touched the
edge of the umbra ; nor did the nebulous circle contract, as the
spots receded from the one limb, or approached the other in their
passage, further than might be attributed to the oblique posi
tion of objects placed on the surface.         The cloudy weather pre
vented any observation being taken till the spots had arrived at
a quarter of the sun's diameter, at which time the nucleus of
revive, invidiously, an old though harmless juke.  He designs only to show
that the opinions entertained by great philosophers often make deep and
lasting impressions on the public, whether of serious or light tendency : for
no other reason than that such bpinions have been promulgated by men
eminently great.

     184              Some Account     of the Solar   Spots
     each was uniformly surrounded by its umbra.              On the 16th,
     however, an opportunity occurred for examining them when
     ^ry near the western limb, and their figure is delineated in
     No. 1. Unfortunately, on the 17 th the sky was overcast, other
     wise the leading spot would have been seen passing the limb, when
     in all probability an indenture or notch would have been per
     ceived.     On the same day, too, the oblique position of the spots
     would have rendered it more easy to discover any alteration in
     the breadth of the umbra, beyond what the rectilineal view might
     have occasioned.      Previous to the 16th, however, no change
     was visible, except only that in approaching the limb the spots
     seemed to become closer together than when near the centre.
     Further observations, therefore, appear necessary in order to
     establish Dr. Wilson's theory; which indeed, were the pheno
     mena he describes uniform and constant, would be extremely
     rational and probable.
         These spots did not reappear with the next revolution of the
     sun, as might have been expected, at the end of the month; nor did
     the disk of the sun present any thing remarkable till the middle
     of October ; when, on the 16th, two small spots moving in a
     line were faintly seen near the centre. On the 1 7th, 1 8th and
     20th, they appeared full to view ; and having traversed the disk
     almost in a line, the foremost passed the western limb on the
      21st, at an angle of about forty-three degrees south of the equa
     tor.     In general the course of the macule       is,  with  alittle va
     riation, parallel to the sun's equator but the direction in which
                                             ;
     these proceeded was very singular and curious.            If mechanical
      causes   are sought  to account   for  this peculiar  motion,    it must
      be concluded that the spots were impelled        by  two forces acting
      at right angles to each other.      The revolution of the sun would
      give one power, in the direction of the equator; but what force
      could be exerted in   a  line with the polar axis appears inexplica
      ble.    See No. 2.
         On November st, two spots were seen, the one a little south
                        1
      of the sun's equator, and not far from the line of its axis and   ;
      another somewhat larger in size, north of the equator,and rather
      nearer to the line of the poles.      On the following day (Nov. 2d)
      the southern spot had advanced, but in an oblique direction; and
      that to the north had passed over       a   space more than equal to
      one fourth of the diameter of the disk, and was stationed about
      halfway between the centre and western limb. (See No. 3.) The
      nature of the sun     isso totally unknown, that   it   isimpossible to
      assign any philosophical reason for this accelerated motion       ;  but
     it     obvious from this example, as well as from the circumstances
           is
       noticed in October (see No. 2), as above related, that the spots
       are floating substances, not adhering to the surface of the sun      ;
                                                                    otherwise
,.

                 which appeared during the Year          1 S 1 6.          185
otherwise they would not deviate far from the line pursued by
the revolution of'its axis.        This indeed has long been ascertained
to be the case : for though the general course in which the spot*
move, usually corresponds with the line of the sun's equator,
thev have sometimes been seen to pass in various directions
within the equatorial region.          Speaking of these macule, Adams
says,
         " the paths they describe in their course over the disk are
extremely different, sometimes being in straight lines, sometimes'
in curves ; at one time descending from the northern to the
southern part of the disk, at other times ascending from the
southern to the northern part*." It must be observed, however,
that these irregularities are of rare occurrence  that the spots
very seldom pass what may be called the tropics of the sun, and
that they have never been seen near the poles.
     Few, if any, of the spots which appeared during the last year,
are to be considered of large size ; nor were there many sur
 rounded with an umbra, which is usually the case with those of
large dimensions.          The two above described, which were seen
 in September, though larger than any others, were by no means
 to be esteemed as occupying any material portion of the disk ;
 and although numerous small spots, sometimes scattered with
 out. order, and sometimes collected in clusters, were almost al
 ways visible ; yet the quantity of light intercepted                 by them
 must have been perfectly insignificant compared with the whole
 areaf.      The spots also remained in general but a short time,
 scarcely ever could they be traced through two successive revo
 lutions; and indeed none have ever been known to continue
 long.     As an instance of the rapidity with which they sometimes
 change, a circumstance observed in October last will fully ex
 emplify.      On the 8th of that month, there were fourteen spots
 of various sizes upon the sun's disk ; most of them faint and
 small, as figured and coloured black, in No. 4; the whole
  placed to the north of the equator: but on the 1 1th, the black
  spots were all entirely vanished, and three others were seen on
  the south of the equator, in the situation in which the spots are
  marked in outline.          The intermediate clays proved so cloudy,
  that no observation was made, whether this change had been
  produced suddenly or gradually.
      With the exception of these appearances, nothing of the least
  importance occurred to the writer's notice during the last six
  months of the year 1816, with respect to the solar macule.
   The disk of the sun is scarcely ever free from spots, but they are
  generally small and of short continuance, of course they present
  nothing worthy of particular observation.
     *  Lectures, vol. iv. p. 229.
     + Some   have stated that the large spots containing nuclei, are often con
   verted into brighter spots, which they termed faculi.       The writer of this
   has never been so fortunate as to see this phenomenon occur.

186       Some Account       of the Solar  Spots which appeared in 1818.
    It may be concluded, therefore, from the foregoing statement,
that the spots on the sun could have had no effect in producing
the inclement summer and autumn of 1816, for these reasons:
first, because no spots appeared upon the disk of sufficient mag
nitude to intercept any material portion of light ; and conse
quently the atmosphere could not have been influenced hy such
a circumstance.           Secondly, that although numerous spots may
have existed, their duration was always too short to produce any
permanent or great effect ; and therefore it is unreasonable to
suppose the atmosphere could have been affected by such trans
itory appearances.            Thirdly, it must be remembered that if any
extraordinary        influence   can be conceived to result from the solar
macule,        it  would not be confined to one quarter of the world
Tather than another ; since the diurnal rotation of the earth
would, in succession, expose all climates and countries to the
same privation *.
    Feb.   1, 1817.
    *  It         not be improper to state, that the above observations were
           may
 made    w itb a  three-feel-and-balf achromatic telescope, to tl e end of which
was adapted a light frame resembling a three-legged stool. This frame
was fixed upon the telescope by means of a hole through which the smaller
end of it was accurately fitted, being lined with cloth that it might he made
 firm, without injury to the telescope.    The leus of the frame expand, and
 at the distance of seven or eight inches a thin circular hoard iva* lixed to the
 ends of them parallel with the eye-glass of the telescope.     Upon this hoard
 a paper was placed, having a circle drawn on it of the same diameter ns
 that produced hy the image of the sun's rays falling upon the board with
 the focus of the eye-glass       properly adjusted.   Across the cicle were
drawn three lines ; one exactly perpendicular to the horizon; ano'her in
clining eight degrees westward, representing the axis of the sun ; and a
 third at right angles to the axis representing the equator. When the ap
 paratus was used, the window-shutter was closed, except onefold; and
 over that was placed a thick piece of cloth, having a hole in the middle
 with a kind of sleeve inserted into it. The telescope was passed through
this sleeve, which reeved up close round the tube with a string, and the end
 then put out at the window and directed to the sun.      When the image was
perceived on the paper, a small weight suspended by a tine kiik thread af
fixed to the upper leg of the frame, threw a shadow across the centre of
 the disk, and the perpendicular line daawn on the paper was then made
 exactlv to correspond with it. Thus prepared, the situation and size of
 any spots might be marked on the paper with a pencil; and by accuralely
 adjusting the shadow of the silk to the vertical lme on the paper in suc
 cessive observations the motion of the spots may be traced with accuracy.
 It is necessary, however, in making observations of some continuance,
 where several spots are to be marked, that an assistant should carefully
 turn the raekwork to correspond with the motion of the sun, otherwise the
 disk amt the circle on the paper will not coincide.      A little practice ren
 ders this easy.
    Messrs. W, and S. Jones, opticians in Ilolhom, are acquainted with the
 apparatus used by the writer, which may be adapted to any achromatic
telescope ; and gentlemen, and even young ladies, may be enabled to
amuse themselves with observing the solar phenomena, without trouble
or ditficulty,and also without hut ting their eyes.

   XLVI.     Improvement    on the  Sliding- Rule.     By Silva'nus-
                             Bevan, Esq.
M ost of the following description        of a little invention of miifej
which seems likely     to extend   the  uses  of the sliding-rule, was
prepared about nine months ago with a view to insertion in the
Philosophical Magazine; but more important matters having
then occasioned it to be neglected, I now offer it for that pur-'
pose.     1 call it my invention,  because it is new to me, and to
all my scientific friends to whom I have shown it ; and because
the advantages which it promises over the old construction
would probably have prevented it from lying dormant if it had
previously occurred to others.       And I think I am warranted in
this conclusion by the circumstance, that but a very short time
had elapsed after its first promulgation, when so much of it as
appeared to be adapted to the purposes of the Board of Excise
was introduced into general practice under its authority.
   The annexed drawing (PI. I II. fig. 5) shows that, instead of having,
like the common sliding-rule, a fixed and a moveable line of num
bers, each reaching from 1 to 10, and repeated to a second 10j
mine has one line reaching from 1 to 10, and another reaching
from about 3 to 10, and thence onward to 3-3 ; or more exactly,
from the square root of 10, 3- 163, to the repetition of the same
number ; one of these lines being inverted, or counting from
right to left, whilst the other is placed in the usual manner. By
this construction, without any diminution of its uses (as I shall
presently show), the sliding-rule is reduced to one half its usual
bulk, to the great increase of its portability and convenience ; or,
if its original length be retained, the size and accuracy of its di
visions are doubled.      But these are the least of its advantages :
for while it performs the usual operations of multiplication, di
vision, and proportion, with as much facility as the common
sliding-rule, it also shows, on inspection, the square root and all
the factors of a number given.        For, by the construction of the
line of numbers, the distance between the first and second terms
of a given proportion equals the distance between the third and
fourth ; and by the inversion of one of the scales it happens,
that if the second and third terms are made to coincide, the first
and fourth will coincide also.        Hence it follows, that in any
given position of the slide, the products of coincident numbers
are equal throughout ; and if one of these numbers be unity, the
correspondent number is the product of every contiguous pair,
which are consequently its factors, and its root is shown by
their equality.      For example: Let it be required to multiply 1(5
 by 4:  place those two factors together, as in the figure; and
opposite to I will be found the product 64.           Divide 64 by 2: 
                                                                    place

  188          Some Remarks upon an urinary Calculus
place 1 opposite to 64 ; and against the divisor 2 will stand the
 quotient 32. Given 4, 8, and 8, to find a fourth proportional : 
place 8 opposite to 8 ; against 4 is found 16.          To find the fac
 tors of 64 :  bring 1 to that number; in this position of the scale
every factor will be found opposite to its reciprocal ; as 2 against
32, 4 against 16, 8 against 8, which is consequently the square
root of the given number.        Or, if the factors of 640 be required,
the same position of the slide shows that 2x320, 4x160,
   x 128, 8 x 80, 10 x 64, 16 x 40, and 20 x 32, equally produce
that number; whilst the juxtaposition of 25-3 in both lines
shows that to be its root with as much accuracy as can be ex
pected from so short a radius.
    The scale reduced in length in the manner above described,
but without the inversion of either of its lines, is competent to the
solution of all questions of simple multiplication or division ; and
in this form it is prepared for the use of the officers of the Ex
cise by R. B. Bate, of the Poultry, the accuracy and neatness of
whose workmanship         1 cannot    avoid mentioning, though I am
sensible they are too well known to derive any publicity from this
notice of them.

XLVII.     SomeRemarks upon an urinary Calculus having a Cinder
    as its  Nucleus; with a Notice of other Calculi containing a
    small Quantity of Carbonate of Lime.           The occurrence also
    of Brown     Spar,  noticed  in the   Trap  Rock  near Newport in
    Gloucestershire.
           .J
Sir,  .Having         seen
                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
                              in one of your late numbers an account
of an urinary calculus chiefly composed of carbonate of lime, I
have been induced to send you the following particulars of a cal
culus composed likewise of carbonate of lime, and further inter
esting from the substance forming its nucleus.
    This substance is a common cinder, . and it constitutes the
greater part of the specimen.        Although it is impossible to mis
take its appearance, I may observe that sulph. acid when treated
with a very small quantity of it very soon acquired a dark-brown
colour.      The cinder is surrounded but not intermixed with a
layer   of  a yellowish -white colour, which dissolves in muriatic
acid with a brisk effervescence, leaving behind a few tender floc-
culi. The solution being treated with subcarbonate of potash
yielded carbonate of lime nearly to the amount of the original
quantity employed ; viz. two grains. To certify the presence of
carbonic acid, I put a very small quantity of the calculus in a
two-dram bottle, which immediately upon being filled with a di

                       having a Cinder as its Nucleus.                                1   89
lute acid and covered with a small bit of glass, was quickly in
verted so as to stand upon the glass.             In this way the bottle
soon became filled with gas, which, upon being transferred into
a small tube of lime-water        and agitated in                 it,
                                                          was quickly ab
sorbed, rendering at the same time the lime-water milky. Hence
the earthy part of the calculus         chiefly composed of carbonate
                                               is
of lime mixed with a little animal membrane.                  The exterior
surface of the calculus      of brown colour, and presents that kind
                                is    a
of uneven appearance usually seen in mulberry calculi.                  The
brown coating, however,          quite superficial, and
                                     is                       probably de
                                                                        is
rived from animal matter, as         could find no trace of uric acid.
                                          I
Curious as the structure of this specimen                     is,

                                                                  I
history of   it   extremely
                  is          obscure.       belongsIt   to  my friend Mr.
Richard Smith senior, surgeon to the Bristol Infirmary, whose
account of    it  Ihave transmitted to you.
    Any one from its figure and appearance might consider                 as         it
a   human calculus; but             hardly possible to conceive how
                                     it   is                                               a
cinder of this size could have been introduced into the bladder
either of a    male or female: besides which, the non-existence of
uric acid which      generally present in some proportion or other in
                       is
human calculi, and the fact of its being composed of carbonate of
 lime,  very common ingredient in animal calculi, but rare one
         a                                                                       a
in   those of the human bladder,  are considerations very contra
 dictory to this idea.    May not the cinder have been wantonly
 thrust into the bladder of a cow or some other animal, and in
 this way have given origin to the present concretion                        ?
    I  recollect Mr. Brande, in       paper of his in the Philosophical
                                               a
 Transactions, speaks      of  several  human urinary calculi having
 extraneous bodies for their nuclei, one of which was an hazel
 nut.
     Having had free access to the extensive collection of Mr.
 Richard Smith, and having gone through the analysis of                  va          a
 riety  of  specimens,     may
                            I    here  take   an   opportunity   of  stating
 that have met with three calculi, all human, which contained
     I
a   small admixture of carbonate of lime.          In dissolving    calculus     a
  (which I   had reason  to  believe one of the    ainmoniaco-magnesian
 phosphates) in acetic acid, was surprised at seeing
                                      I                          slow effer  a
 vescence take place, which         found I      the expedient above de
                                                         by
 scribed to proceed from the disengagement of carbonic acid.
  The proportion of carbonate of lime was discovered by dissolving

      In  another  calculus  principally composed       of the    ammoniaco-
  magnesian phosphate, the proportion of carbonate of lime was
  only half the above quantity; and in a third it was still less. I wish
  particularly to mention these instances of the occurrence of car
  bonate of lime, because Dr. Henry in his invaluable work (Ele
  ments of Chemistry) calls in question the authority of Proust,
  in giving carbonate of lime as an ingredient in urinary calculi.
      I  have seen somewhere a notice of Mr. Bakewell having dis
  covered prehnite in the trap rock of Micklewood near Newport,
  Gloucestershire.      I regret that the particular spot is not men
  tioned as I (among many others who have examined the hill)
  am extremely curious to know the exact locality. This rock is
   highly interesting, as it exhibits great variety in its structure;
  being sometimes a sort of iron clay, sometimes trap tuff, in an
  other place exhibiting globular concretions of basaltic clinkstone;
   but the greater part of it is an amygdaloid consisting generally
   of a basis of iron clay, in which are oval concretions of green
   earth, and of a mineral of a white and brown colour resembling
   calc spar, and which has been by many mistaken as such.                    I
   have   found  the  same   substance   in veins in the rock, and upon
   analysis I find that it is the mineral called brown spar, and
   contains 44 per cent, of carbonate of magnesia.              I am, sir,

   Mr. B. G. Burroughs of Clifton, about            a year since.     Being in
   the habit of cutting them through, in order to exhibit the nu

covered with a black matter, and still more so when I found the
strange substance of which it was chiefly composed.               I became
of course extremely anxious to learn its history.               But this is
all that I could obtain from Mr. B. "That it had been in his pos
session four or five years, and that the person who gave it to him
told him that it was extracted- by a Mr. Pye, and Mr. B. did
not doubt that a human subject was implied."
      Some gentlemen who have seen it imagine that it might
have been taken from a watering-place in a street : but I have
submitted substances to a trial of pouring urine upon them, and
find the appearance entirely different.           In the latter instances
there is an even uniform stratum super stratum ; whereas in
this calculus there is a distinct tubercular appearance, resembling
those denominated mulberry. Again : in the one case the layers
are tender and easily brushed off, but here they are excessively
firm.                              ,
    One circumstance is not unworthy of remark, which is  that
 out of more than one hundred and fifty sets of calculi in my

which does not contain oxalic acid.

 To    Dr. IV. H. Gilly.
     This calculus certainly contains no oxalate of lime,          as  it dis
 solves completely in dilute acetic acid ; whereas oxalate of lime
 is insoluble in that acid.

  192             Instruction on the making of Bread
      A crop which seemed to promise a remarkable fecundity, al
  though it had been already a long time retarded by the influence
  of the cold and wet season, has occasioned much inquietude and
  fatigue to cultivators.
      Some instructions have been published, in order to sustain their
  zeal and direct their labours.    It has been recommended to them
  to put their sheaves under cover as soon as cut ; and not to wait
  till the end of the harvest, to lead their produce home. It has
  been also advised, that when they are obliged to leave any sheaves
  upon the ground, they should form them into little upright stacks,
  put some covering over them, and thus secure them from the
  pernicious influence of the wet ; and more particularly they have
  been cautioned against heaping wet sheaves in granaries or in
  stacks, and impressed with the necessity of thrashing them as
  soon as possible, in order to extract from them at least a part
  of the grain which they contain, and drying the grain before
  sending it to the mill.
      These useful instructions have, without doubt, been sufficiently
 disseminated; but it is to be feared that an inconsiderate at
  tachment to old habits has prevented them from being every
 where followed with that attention which they merit; and it
 becomes thus the more urgent to provide the proper remedy
 and prevent the progressive and prolonged increase of the evil.
                       Alterations in wet Grain.
     Crops which have been for a long time more or less exposed
 to an abundant humidity/experience        different sorts and different
 degrees   of  alterations.   In  each  of  these different states, they
 present different   results  to the cultivator in regard to his seed
  to the miller in grinding  and to the baker in bread-making.
     Wet grain, when heaped up in, granaries or in stacks, without
 currents of air being preserved through the interior, as has fre
quently been recommended, gpes speedily to ruin ; the humidity
 does not ascend to the top so as to evaporate ; it concentrates in
 the inteeior ; it rots the straw ; and according to its abundance
 or its temperature, hastens the germination which has begun,
or rather excites a fermentation which heats and discolours the
grain; at times the grain becomes even mouldy, and the straw
reduced to the state of dung.
    The granaries and farm-yards have this year presented corn
in all these different states. When the grain of such corn is
sent without preparation to the mill, it clogs the millstones, and
is difficult to work : if the germination          has only just com
menced, the process goes on and is soon completed in the sacks;
and the flour made from it begins in a few days to collect into
pieces of such a consistency, that it is necessary, in order to
                                                                   make

make it workable to pound it with mallets.            Flour of this de
scription is difficult to work, even    when   very speedily used ; and
when it gets old it is impossible to make bread of it without
mixing it with some of a better sort.
     Grain thus deteriorated always loses part of its natural weight.
Thus while the good grain of 1815 and 1816 weighs commonly
from 73 to 75 kilogrammes each hectolitre, the same quantity,
if it has begun to germinate, will weigh only 61 kilogrammes 5
hectogrammes;  if greatly germinated, 55 kilogrammes ;  if
red-heated 63 kilogrammes;  and if moulded without being ger
minated, 57 kilogrammes.         Nothing serves so well as weighing,
to ascertain the degree of alteration which grain suffers from
the effect. of humidity.
     The protJ/vee of grain in these different states is commonly as
follower  The good grain of 1815 : 58 kilogrammes 5 hecto
grammes of flour and pollard, 1 1 kilogrammes of bran. That of
 1816: 56 kilogrammes 5 hectogrammes of flour and pollard,
 14 kilogrammes        5 hectogrammes of bran.       Grain slightly ger
 minated : 40 kilogrammes 5 hectogrammes flour and pollard,
  17 kilogrammes      2 hectogrammesn7 decagrammes bran. Greatly
 germinated     :  36 kilogrammes    7 hefctogrammes    5 decagrammes
 of flour and pollard, and 17 kilogrammes 7 hectogrammes 5
 decagrammes of bran. Red-heated: 44 kilogrammes of flour and
 pollard, 15 kilogrammes of bran. And lastly, grain moulded
 produces only 35 kilogrammes 5 hectogrammes flour and pol
 lard, and 13 kilogrammes 1 hectogramme of bran.
          Damaged Grain ought not        to be employed as Seed.
     Grain which has germinated, been heated or moulded, ought
 by no means to be used as seed.            In the experiments which
 have been made this year with much care, in order to determine
 in what degree grain which has been in different proportions
 deteriorated, dry and wet, may yet be available as seed, it has been
 found, that grain if it has suffered a commencement of germina
 tion does not rise but in the proportion of one half of the seed
 employed;  if strongly germinated,in the proportion of one-third :
 and if fired or moulded, of not more than one-fifth.         The stalks
 are in all cases of a paler colour and of a less vigorous appear
 ance than those from healthy seed, and give little promise of
 living to maturity.
        Effects of Humidity     on the constituent   Parts of Corn.
     It  is chiefly the glutinous part which is altered in corn which
  has been exposed to humidity.        The gluten loses almost entirely
  its adhesive    powers; and dissolves into a sort of pap or starch, in
  place     of presenting that consistency and elasticity which di-

 the making of bread.
                            Drying of Grain.
     The drying of wet grain is the only means of arresting the
  progress of its destruction.
     The most simple mode for this purpose, and that which can
 be most
           generally adopted, is to dry the grain in a baking-oven,
 which is to be met with in most country places.
     The grain may be put into the oven immediately after the
 bread has been withdrawn ; the temperature is then at such a
 degree thai .a person may introduce his naked arm without being
 much incommoded by the heat*.           After the grain has been
 thrown into the oven, it should be spread into a bed of from
 eight to ten centimetres (from three to four inches) in thickness,
 and stirred frequently with a shovel or rake, in order to facili
 tate the disengagement of the vapour.         At the end of ten or
 fifteen minutes, according to the state of humidity in which the
 grain  is,   it may be withdrawn from the oven         will then be
                                                         :   it
 sufficiently dried  ;and when exposed to the air until perfectly
 cooled, will have acquired all the qualities necessary to render
it   fit both for the miller and the baker.
     Ovens which are surmounted          platform offer
                                     by
                                     a                     very easy
                                                                  a
 means of drying with more or less rapidity, according to the de
 gree of temperature which     it may be thought proper to give the
 platform.
     Another very simple means which the Commission have em
 ployed, consists in drying the grain in  a  flat iron or copper caul
 dron.     The dimensions of that employed were four feet in
 width, ten feet in length, and four inches                   At one of
                                                  a in

 its extremities   astove was placed, of such         construction that
 either wood or pitcoal or turf might be burned in            and from
                                                             it   ;
 this stove the smoke was circulated under the cauldron               by
                                                                  means
 of flues, which  being  made  of brick served  besides  to support the
 cauldron itself.    In adopting this method of drying, the bed of
 grain ought not to be more than one inch thick, and should be
 stirred from time to time with a rake.      The temperature should
 be at least from 90 to 100 centigrades       ;   perhaps     may even
                                                              it
 without inconvenience be raised as high as 130.         The place in
 which the operation      is carried on should be ventilated from
 time to time.    One man may with an apparatus of this descrip
 tion dry more than twelve bushels of corn in an hour, reckoning

degrees Reaumur).     It has been then well diied in five minutes, and
without suffering any injury.

                       Process of Baking.
     As the yeast   is the principal  agent in the fermentation, nothing
is more important         than that it should be procured in the best
state.    It ought to be such as has been very recently prepared,
and on no account more than twenty-four hours old.
   All potable waters are good for baking. The best flour im
bibes about one half of its weight of water; middling good, from
a fifth to a fourth.
   The temperature of the water ought, in general, to be in an
inverse ratio to that of the air  that         as much colder as the air
                                                     is,
is hotter,  and    vice  versa.
    The baking of flour which has been made from germinated
grain ought to be proceeded in with much greater rapidity than
that of flour from grain noways injured because, the gluten of such
                                                     ;
flour having been more or less destroyed, the process of its fer
mentation goes on much quicker.            The water employed ought to
be of less warmth in all the operations              the paste should be
                                                           ;

as in the ordinary case       ;   and  itought not to be given out for
consumption      till  two  or three  days after     has been- baked.
                                                           it           By
attending    to  these    directions,  bread   will  be obtained  from the
flour of germinated corn, which, without being as good as that
which       made from the best flour, will yet be sufficiently salu
           is
brious and of   a    good enough appearance.
     It  necessary to observe, however, that
          is                                                only from the
                                                                it   is
flour of such corn as has been very slightly germinated that
bread of the above description can be obtained, unless the corn
has been dried before being ground: but when corn even greatly
germinated has undergone such previous desiccation,                    willit
yield a flour capable of making much better bread than flour
from corn which, though less germinated, has not had the bene
fit of drying.
    Previous drying has not, however, been found sufficient to
render grain which has been fired or moulded capable of yield
ing an eatable bread, or removing the nauseous flavour and acrid
taste which distinguishes grain thus deteriosated.
 *   In the numerous experiments which Duhamel has made upon the de
siccation of wet or germinated corn, he has never found more than one-
cighth of its weight   superabundant water; the mean quantity was only
                       in
about a sixth.

 Mixtures proper      to ameliorate the  making of Bread from the
                       Flour of damaged   Gram.
     It is only by a mixture with good flour that the produce of
 damaged grain can be turned to good account.         By joining only
 one-third of good flour to two-thirds of flour from fired or moulded
 grain, a bread will be obtained of a taste not unpalatable : but
 it is only by mixing a half or rather two-thirds of good flour
 with one-third of this inferior flour, that the taste of the bread
 produced is so improved as to entitle it to be considered as good
 household bread.
  ,
     It deserves to be noticed that it is vain to employ a greater
 quantity of yeast in the hope of improving the fabrication of the
 bread.     The paste deprived of gluten is unable to retain the
 effects of the fermentation excited by the yeast.     The bread has
 a good enough external appearance ; but in proportion as there
 has heen an excess in the quantity of yeast, its consistency is so
 much the less, and all the bad qualities of the flour in respect of
 flavour and taste have a fuller development.

                              .  Bread.
     The mixture of a third of the flour of maize or barley or po
 tatoes with a third of good flour, and a third of flour from
 heated or moulded grain, produces a bread fully equal to that
 fabricated by the mixture of two-thirds of good with one-third
 of damaged flour.
     In the process of baking with such mixtures there is no dif
 ference from the ordinary mode : it is only necessary to observe
 that, in using maize or potatoes, the oven ought to be less heated
-than for barley or oats, and least so in the case of potatoes.
    The following mixtures of these and other substances the Com
 mission offer with confidence, as calculated to form excellent
 household bread.
                                 Maize.
    One-half maize and one-half barley, with a leaven of wheateu
 flour of one-fifth of the total weight.
    One-half maize and one-half wheaten flour.         A more agree
 able and better bread it is impossible to eat.
                                  Oats.
     One-half oatmeal and one-half barley, with a leaven of
 wheaten flour of rather more than one-fifth.
     One-half oatmeal and one-half wheaten flour. Excellent,
                                 Barley.
    Add to any quantity of barley-flour one-fifth of its weight     in
 wheaten leaven.      Bread white and savoury.

       Barley    and rye, or barley and wheat, in equal proportions.
   The last    is equal to the best bread  of wheaten flour alone.
                                 Buck-wheat.
       In equal proportions with barley or rye, and a wheaten leaven
   of one-fifth of the weight. Or still better with one entire half
   of wheaten flour.
                                   Potatoes.
       In general the potatoe may serve when it is dry for one-half,
   and when fresh or new for two-thirds, and even for four-fifths in      ,
   the fabrication of household bread.       This last quantity of four-
   fifths is the greatest which the Commission has been able to
   employ with advantage ; but all their experiments with that
   proportion have been attended with uniform success.
       Oats, barley, rice or maize, also mix well with potatoes, when
   used with a wheaten leaven of one-fifth of the total weight. .
                     Employment     offoreign  Substances.
       Various foreign substances have been recommended for ame
   liorating the fabrication of bread, and correcting the faults of
   damaged grain : such as the addition of alum, carbonate of soda,
   magnesia, diluted sulphuric acid, salt of tartar, vinegar, sul
   phate of iron, gums, &c.        The Commission have made experi
   ments with most of these substances ; and some of them do ap
   pear, in fact, to possess in a slight degree the qualities which
   have been ascribed to them.         But the Commission see no ne
   cessity  for  recurring to any such foreign aids,  most of which do
  not in themselves possess any nutritive quality,  as long as by a
  previous desiccation of the grain, by good grinding and by pro
  per care, a wholesome bread may be obtained from all wet or
- germinated grain, and as long as, even in the case of flour of the
  most deteriorated description, it is only necessary to add a por
  tion of good flour to obtain an excellent household bread.
       XLIX.      On Aerial Navigation.      By A Correspondent.
  It    is a singular circumstance in the history of the arts, that an
  invention at its first appearance is frequently pursued with the
  greatest eagerness, and yet will afterwards be wholly neglected
  for years, until some happy improvement fixes it permanently on
  the public attention.       Many will remember the great zeal ex
  cited by the subject of aerial navigation, and the astonishing sub
  sequent neglect of an art so important, until the late revival of
  the subject by Sir George Cayley and other eminent philoso
  phers.
                                    N3                              The

198                       On Aerial Navigation.
   The following statement of        every thing important which has
been suggested       on this point, with some new views, is offered
for the purpose of facilitating further inquiries.
                              Vertical Motion.
    1. The balloon being inflated with hydrogen, descends by
letting out some of the gas, and ascends again by throwing out
ballast.     To this method it is a radical objection, that the means
of alternate ascent and       descent are very soon exhausted.
    2. The air in the balloon being expanded by heat, the vertical
motion is produced by increasing or diminishing the quantity of
fuel.     To this method it is an objection, that the fuel will ulti
mately be exhausted ; also, if common air be used, the balloon
must be of very large dimensions to support the car ; and if the
air be hydrogen, the expansion by heat is attended with the
greatest danger.
    3 . The balloon being i nflated with hydrogen, another is suspended
below the ear, and into this the circumjacent air is forced by an
easy mechanical contrivance, and is let out again at pleasure.
By these means the machine descends upon increasing the den
sity of the air, and ascends upon restoring it to its former state.
This method is worthy of peculiar consideration, not being liable
to the former objections, and being analogous to that contri
vance of Nature, by which fishes sink at pleasure, and rise again
to the surface.
                               Lateral Motion.
    1. The most obvious method of producing a lateral motion
is by taking advantage of the winds.              These are : occasional
winds;     trade winds   between   the tropics;  the land and sea breezes
 which in warm climates set from and towards the shore by day
 and night alternately; the superior currents of air, which often
 proceed in a direction contrary to those below ; and the breezes,
 which commonly follow the direction of every river.             To these
 aids we may also add the remarkable phenomenon observed by
 all aerial navigators, viz. that the balloon sinks lower than
 usual when over water, and that it has a tendency to keep the
 direction of a river.      This circumstance may partly be attributed
 to the wind following the current, but principally to the specific
 gravity of air impregnated with aqueous vapour being diminished,
 and the tendency of the machine to the point of least gravity.
     2. The very ingenious proposal lately made, of directing a
 balloon like the tacking of a ship, by means of an inclined plane,
 is worthy of much consideration.           Jt is obvious that the addi
 tional weight      of an inclined  plane may be avoided, by forming
 the balloon     of  some figure not a sphere : thus, for instance, it
 may be an oblong spheroid, whose major axis is kept inclined at
                                                                        an

                                                                           1 99
                         On Aerial Navigation.
an angle of 45° to the horizon, by means of the weight suspended
in the car. But a little calculation will show that the lateral mo
tion produced is very small, and not sufficient to counteract any
considerable wind ; for the whole vertical velocity in the ascent
is easily computed, and is not large; and the resolved motion in
a lateral direction, being a function of the angle of inclination,
is still smaller, and much less than the velocity of any gale of
 wind.
     3.  A great number of mechanical contrivances in imitation
of wings and oars     have been suggested, and even tried, but
                                                                          with
 a most discouraging degree of success.            Upon    examining        the
 cause of these failures, it is easy to see that the experiments          have
 been made on principles fundamentally erroneous.                In the first
                                                                           it is
 place, the power has always been applied to the car, though
 obvious that in such a case the greatest part of the power is
 lost in giving the car a rotatory motion round the balloon, and
 that the power, in order to be entirely effective, should be ap
                                                                             the
 plied in a line passing through the centre of pressure of
 whole system.       In the second place, the mechanism             imitated
 has been that employed by Nature in enabling a bird to fly,
 though it is obvious that the animal's wings are contrived as
  much for support in the air, as for lateral motion.             Our whole
 attention should be directed     to   the  mechanism      of fishes,   whose
  air-bladders assimilate them to an      inflated balloon,   and   in  which
  the system is wholly contrived for the purposes       of  horizontal     mo
  tion, progression being produced by the rapid          vibrations    of    the
  tail, acting like a single oar upon the hinder part of              a   boat.
  When we see the rapid progress made by the salmon against the
  swiftest stream, we should not despair of success; and certainly
  not on account of the small muscular power of man, if we con
  sider that the steam-engine with the weight of one man com
  mands the power of four.        It is indeed a matter of serious in
  quiry, whether such a machine would not require something
   more solid to work upon than a metallic poop, or any thing
   which the balloon could support.         It is obvious that much ad
   vantage will be gained, if any mechanism acting on the air should
   move with much greater velocity than the balloon, as the re
   sistance or power increases with the square of the velocity.                It
   will also be a matter of experiment what        form  of  balloon    is  least
   resisted ; for the received systems on this subject are universally
    allowed to be erroneous, as the resistance varies as ar2 + br [b
   being negative in an elastic medium), and as it will probably be
    found to be a function of the figure of the body resisted.

      L.   Queries on Steam-Boais.        By Mr. George Rennie,
                                To  Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,  Whoever reflects on the numerous improvements in
  the arts and sciences, to which a short but eventful period has
  given birth, oannot but hail with pleasure the recent introduction
  of steam-vessels,  an improvement of the highest importance,
  which discloses a new ,era in navigation, and demands every effort
  for its further improvement.         I have therefore sent the follow
  ing queries in reference to this interesting subject; trusting that
   such of your readers as may deem an inquiry of this nature in
  teresting, will turn their scientific talents to its further elucida
  tion, which I will also endeavour to do, should not other avoca
  tions intervene to prevent me.
                     I have the honour to be, sir,
                                           Yours, &c.
  London, March 12, 1817.                            GEORGE RENNIE.
      I. Steam-vessels (unlike ships, whose velocity is always irre
  gular and varied at every augmentation or diminution of the
  wind) have one assigned velocity, according to their respective
  propelling powers.         What is the best form that ought to be
  given    to the head   and  stern ? The extreme length, breadth and
  depth    ?  Whether   flat or  round bottom, in order that the requi
  sites of stability, velocity and strength, may attain a minimum?
      II. It has been found that the ratio of the resistance being
  as the squares of the velocities (especially in large surfaces and
  great velocities) does not maintain ; or, in other words, that an
  engine of a quadruple power will not produce a double effect or
  velocity: -can anyformula be adapted to practice so as to include
  the circumstances of friction, imperfect fluidity, or adhesion ?
       III. From the experiments of Dubuat, it is deduced that the
  whole impulse to be withstood or overcome by the external force
  is the sum of the plus and minus pressures and of friction ; that
  the non -pressure on the hinder part was prodigiously diminished
   (l-4th), by making the length of the body triple its breadth; from
. which he infers that the lengthening of a ship diminishes the
  resistance ;  a paradox, for it supposes a less power to displace
   a greater quantity of fluid than a small quantity, independent of
  Other circumstances.        How far is this consistent with theory
   and practice ?
      IV. Admitting perfection to the steam,  to which Mr. Watt
   to his everlasting credit has been so instrumental ;  how far con
   sistent with ceconomy, saving of fuel, and attendance on two
                                                               furnaces^

                         Queries on Steam-Boats.                  201
  furnaces, is the adoption of two boilers in place of one, still used
  in many steam-vessels, and situated athwart the vessel ?
      V. Two steam-engines have been and still are used in some
  steam-vessels.    What advantage have they over one of double
  the power ?
     VI. Steam-engines have been constructed with the beam
  working above, to the rejection of the beams below. Does not
  this lessen the stability of the vessel, by removing the centre of
  gravity higher, and how far is it an improvement ?
     VII. What is the best situation of the paddle-wheels;  at the
  extreme breadth of beam, or where ? The proper velocity for the
  floats or paddles ? Their area with reference to the section of
  the immersed part of the vessel ? Their properest form ? and
  their depth with regard to their width ? The angle best adapted
  to the velocity of the wheel and vessel ; so that no impediment
t shall arise from the improper displacement of the fluid ? and
  lastly, the number of floats ?
     VIII. The momentum acquired by a steam-vessel in motion,
  after a short time, is analogous to that of a fly-wheel ;  ought
  the addition of this fly, adopted in many steam-vessels, to be
k considered superfluous ?
     IX. One of the most insuperable objections to steam-vessels,
  in long voyages across the ocean, must lie in the vast consump
  tion of fuel and bulk occupied by it.     How far can this be over
  come, without the substitution     of  some new power ? the at
  tainment of which is the grandest desideratum in mechanical
  science.
     X. In the event of steam-vessels being employed in war ;
   what is the best mode of rendering the paddles shot proof?
  Would the middle of the vessel render that protection ? as with
  out this a vessel disabled under such circumstances, must neces
  sarily be at the mercy of her enemy.
      XI. Presuming the above-mentioned difficulty as got over,         .
  might not they choose their position ? and their distance ? By
  presenting neither masts nor yards, they might cripple their ene
  my without suffering in turn ; their movements would continue
  all along optional; they might escape from their enemy by
  steering against the wind.     A calm to them is a fair wind.
     XII. By presenting no top weight of masts or yards, which
  are merely temporary, the continual tendency to destroy the
  hull would be' avoided ; and all the advantages of trussing on
   Mr. Seppings's principle could be included, which would at once
   add stability and strength, rendering her free from the uncertainty
   of leeway and heave of the sea, and render the reckoning more
   certain.    By being flat-bottomed, and of course drawing little
   water,  the advantages of crossing shallows, and entering harbours.
                                                                     at

at times when other ships cannot ; of towing vessels in riversj
and a variety of other \iseful occupations. Neither, from their ex
tra length and breadth, would thev pitch or roll so mucb.          A
sail might be occasionally used in lieu of the engine to save fuel,
    XIII. It would follow from the last premises, that in action
their guns might be pointed with more precision, and the heeling
 after firing would be less.
    XIV. The objections to the employment of steam-boats or
barges in canals, is the destruction occasioned to their banks by
the violent action of the water during the passage of the steam
boats, and to the want of width in the locks.      Would these ob
jections    be partly remedied by placing the paddles, behind ? (for
we have a'l along supposed paddles the best) or could any of
the modes hitherto practised for propelling boats answer ; so
 as to be of use in doing away with the number of horses and
men. usually employed in this service?
     XV. Would not the advantages attending a steam-boat, solely
for the purpose of towing other boats with passengers and goods,
be superior to the present mode, of having the passengers and
goods in the same boat as the engine, thereby rendering the
vessel weaker by its great length, and unequally strained by the
greater or less weight of passengers and goods, which is always
li able to vary, and must sink the vessel more or less ; thus drown
 ing her wheels or paddles, and consequently obstructing her mo
tion?  independent of those dreadful accidents, frequently liable
Mo arise from bad engines, as latelv in America, and one instance
 in this country.
     XVI. Lastly, and politically speaking, are the benefits hereto
fore stated, as liable to occur by the employment of steam-
 ,vessels in war, in navigation and commerce, by defeating our
  enemies abroad, by facilitating conveyance at home, and ren
 dering cheaper the commodities of foreign countries, to be
  counterbalanced by consuming with additional extravagance the
 very vitals of our country (which our coals are) by the great ca
  pital consumed in the rapid destruction of the materials of which
  steam-vessels are composed ; and by creating a superabundant
  population, which have been, still are, and probably will be, the
  curse of this great and hitherto happy country?             G. R.
                LI.   On Mr. Horn's    Theory of Vision.
                            To Mr.  Tilloch.
  Sir,  Your correspondent J. Q. R. not having seen " The
  Seat of Vision determined," has unconsciously attributed some
                                                      inconsistencies

                     On Mr. Horn's     Theory   of Fision.              203
inconsistencies to Mr. A. Horn for which he is not accountable.
Mr. Horn does not maintain that the extremities of the optic
nerve are insensible to the impressions of light, while its trunk
is endued with a power of transmitting such impressions to the
brain.        After examination, having satisfied himself that " the
retina is nothing else than an expansion of the scepta, or mem
braneous substance that pervades the optic nerve," he divests it
of its long usurped sensibility, and limits the extremities of the
 nerve to the circular portion that perforates the cavity of the
eye.       The retina he considers a concave mirror, to which the
 choroides serves as a coating.          The inverted pictures of exter
 nal objects pointed on the retina are by its powers as a specu
 lum reflected to the anterior concavity of the eye, where (although
 there be nothing much resembling a mirror) a second reflection
 transfers them to nearly " the middle of the vitreous humour, in
 their natural order and position.          These images make due im
 pressions upon the opposite Iwse of the nerve, which are trans
 mitted by it to the brain: thus the sensation is produced and
 vision perfected."
      This mode of vision Mr. Horn regards as a real and incontro
 vertible discovery.       Its originality will scarcely be questioned :
 but as the existence of his images in the vitreous humour de
  pends on two reflections in the cavity of the eve, both destitute
 alike of proof and probability, others may be inclined to regard
  it as nothing more than a simple conjecture.              Even considered
  as a conjecture, a single objection     * seems sufficient for its destruc
  tion.      Mr. Horn says that his images in the vitreous humour
  make due impressions on the opposite base of the " (optic)
  nerve," but now these impressions are made he has left entirely
  unexplained.
       This omission it may be feared the sagacity of few of his
  readers will be able to supply.         That the circular base of the
  optic nerve has the faculty of perceiving images situated at a
  distance, near the middle of the vitreous humour, or that it can
  be duly impressed by them in such a situation, is a proposition
   little likely to procure assent without proof.           Yet unless some
   such faculty be shown to exist, it will be difficult to explain how
   these
            "  due impressions" are effected ; since the pencils of rays
   constituting these hypothetical images in the vitreous humour,
   would in their further progress diverge and diffuse themselves
       * To both Mr.Pater and J. Q. It. a similar objection occurred. Neither
    of                                         " The Seat
        these gentlemen, however, had seen                  of Vision? & c. and
    neither happened to divine exactly Mr. Horn's mode of raising images in
    the vitreous humour.    In consequence of this, the objection is 'oy both
    urged in a way that Mr. Horn will probably contend docs not e.ffect his
    discovery.
                                                                           over

  over the retina.      A small portion of them would therefore fall
  on the circular base of the optic nerve; and the few rays that
   might fall on it could produce neither erect nor distinct images.
      Had we not been assured by Mr. Horn that his " Theory of
  Vision is sanctioned by high philosophical authority," and did
   I not find it copied, with approbation, into Hutton's Mathe
   matical Dictionary, I should deem some apology necessary for
  thus occupying a page of your valuable Magazine.
                           1 am, sir,
                                Your very' obedient servant,
     March 10, 1817.                                              L. S.
      P. S. Page    93  of his pamphlet,   Mr. Horn tells jis, that if a
  convex lens be fixed in an aperture of a window-shutter            in a
  dark ?oom, and the eye placed in its focus of parallel rays, " no
  image whatever impresses the organ ; a circular spot only is
  perceived, uniformly tinged with the prevailing colour of the
  landscape."      This none will doubt. But without referring to his
  pamphlet, it will not easily be credited that he attributes the
  absence of images in this case to the pencils of rays proceeding
  from the objects of the landscape having their foci on the re
  tina! On this principle (with no little exultation at its disco-i
  very) he accounts for the apparent insensibility of the optic
  nerve, which, according to him, only happens when the pencils
  of rays proceeding from the pupil have their foci on its base !
  Surely, if Mr. Horn could for a moment divest his recollection
 of his imaginary discoveries, he would, like others, perceive that
 in such a position as he has described the eye with respect to
 the lens, the pencils of rays proceeding from the objects of the
 landscape could not possibly have their foci on the retina.
 LII.    Letter from Mr. G. Stephenson of the KUlingworth
      Colliery : with a few Remarks on his Claim to Priority in the
     Invention of the Safe-lamp, by the Editor.
                              To  Mr. Tilloch.
            I
Sir,  observe you have thought proper to insert in the
last number of the Philosophical         Magazine, your opinion that
my attempts      at  safety-tubes  and  apertures were borrowed from
what I had heard of Sir Humphry Davy's researches.             You canT
not have read the statements I considered myself called upon to
lay before the public, or you would not thus have questioned my
veracity without producing the evidence that induced you to do
so.    If fire-damp was admitted to the flame of a lamp through
a small tube, that it would be consumed by combustion, and that
                                                               explosion

explosion would not pass, and communicate with the external
gas, was the idea I had embraced, as the principle upon which
a safety-lamp might be constructed, and which I stated to se
veral persons long before Sir H. Davy came into this part of the
country.      The plan of such a lamp was seen by several, and the
lamp itself was in the hands of the manufacturer during the time
he was here, at which period it is not pretended he had formed
any correct idea upon which he intended to act.              With any
subsequent private communication between him and Mr. Hodg
son 1 was not acquainted, nor can it in the slightest degree af
fect my claims.         That I pursued the principle thus discovered
and applied, *and constructed a lamp with three tubes, and one
with small perforations, without knowing that Sir Humphry
Davy had adopted the same idea, and without receiving any hint
of his experiments, is what I solemnly assert.       To my statement
 (which may     be  procured  at Mr. Baldwin's) you are bound to give
credit,   unless  by  the evidence of facts and dates you are able to
disprove it.      If you are in possession of any, I call upon you to
lay them before the public.        If not, as Editor of a Journal pro
fessing to be independent, I trust you will acknowledge that you
have hastily committed an act of great injustice.
   Killingwo ith, March 15, 1817.                   G. STEPHENSON.
-  I trust I have always evinced my earnest desire to be impartial ;
and many who have endeavoured to obtrude improper articles
into the Philosophical Magazine, by inducements which should
never be held out to any journalist, can vouch for my indepen
dence.
    I had " read the statements" to which Mr. Stephenson al
ludes.     Numbers of people as well as Mr. S. had turned their
attention to the devising of a lamp to protect miners against ex
plosions ; and some had actually published their ideas, while
with Mr. S. all was still only an unpublished idea.        To the pe
riod of the conception of an idea I attach no importance what
ever ; and if I may judge of the idea by the form it manifested
at its birth, it was an abortion.
   Mr. Stephenson's lamp tried on the 21st of October 1815,
was not a safeTlamp.        A lamp with one orifice for admitting air,
'' with a slide" over the orifice " to regulate the quantity to be
admitted," could be nothing else but an exploding lamp ; for, to
make the lamp burn in atmospheric air, the orifice must be so
wide that on going into an explosive- atmosphere the combus
tion, could not fail to pass the orifice and explode the mine.
   On the 19th of October Sir H. Davy announced that explosion
would not pass through small tubes ; and
   On the 4th of November Mr. Stephenson tried one with three
                                                                 small

206       On the  Priority of Invention of the Safe-lamp.
small tubes in place of the one opening with a regulator.        Thlt
he says he " found to burn considerably better" than his first one.
"Better!" I deny that his first lamp would burn at all with the
aperture reduced to that size, by the regulator, which would pre
vent the explosion from passing.       He also found this lamp " to
be perfectly safe."     The first, and I cannot doubt that Mr. Ste
phenson   knows   it well, was not safe.   But even now, on the 4th
of November, speaking of this lamp, he says " it did not entirely
answer my expectations."
   On the 24th of November Mr. S. shows another lamp to Mr.
Brandling and Mr. Murray of Henderland, which was tried on
the 30th.    This instead of small tubes had a " perforated plate
covering the air-chamber."        But on the 9th of this month Sir
H. Davy had communicated his invention to the Royal Society;
and that " wire-gauze stops explosion as well as tubes or ca
nals, and yet admits a free draught of air." Now what was Mr.
Stephenson's perforated plate but gauze of a more clumsy ma
nufacture ? Yet have we seen remarks intended to. serve Mr.
S. tending to insinuate that the gauze was borrowed from his
perforated plates !
    Let any person of candour look at the evidence, and then say
whether I have " hastily committed an act of great injustice
                                                                    "
to Mr. S.
   But now I have to add another fact, were more wanted.          Sir
Humphry, after announcing on the 25th of October, to the Che^
tnical Club, that explosions would not pass through small tubes,
made no secret of his experiments.         Many were invited to see
them, and myself among others.           I 'am sorry that I kept no
note of the date of my first visit to the laboratory of the Royal
Institution where they were made ; but from a particular cir
cumstance I am led to believe that it was before the 9th of No
vember, for he made an experiment to show me that an explo
sion would not pass through wire-gauze, and as far as my me
mory serves me, he had made the first experiment with gauze
that same morning.
   Sir Humphry's perfecting improvement followed as a necessary
consequence from his discovery that wire-gauze would prevent
an explosion from passing downward or upward.             If so, how
could it pass side-ways were a cylinder of wire-gauze substituted
for the cylinder of glass ? The glass tube was then thrown away . .
   I did at first believe that Mr. Stephenson made his discovery,
such as it is, independently of Sir Humphry's ; but, from an
after examination of facts, I found myself compelled to take a
different view of the question.     The belief or rejection of a fact
resting on evidence is not with any person a matter of choice,
but of necessity.                                            A. T.

tilll.   Answer     to some   of       the Geological Qtieries in our last
                     Nvmber.            By N.J.W. Esq.
                              To       Mr. Tillocb.
Sir,      It  would have given me much pleasure to answer the
numerous questions proposed by your correspondent at page 122
in the last number of the Philosophical Journal, respecting several
interesting phenomena noticed in the geology of the northern
counties : but not having visited every point in question, I must
be content with briefly stating my opinion on those facts which
 have come under my own observation, referring him to Professor
 Bucklaud of Oxford, and Mr. fryer of Keswick, for an elucida
tion of whatever may appear ainigmatical in the vicinity of Duf-
ton, &c. &c.
     1. The same formation which bounds the coast of Northum
berland north of the Coquet, abuts upon the eastern side of the
 Cheviots, and passes their southern limits ; and I have every
 reason to think the coal-mines on Tindal Fell, by which Carlisle
 is supplied with coals, are situated in this formation ; but it is
 the termination of the Newcastle coal-field that crops out in the
 vicinity of Staindrop. The tract due west and north-west of the
 Cheviots consists of graywacke, with the old red sand-stone oc
 casionally reposing upon it.
     2. Basalt appears to owe its origin to a different cause from
 the regularly stratified rocks with which it is associated, never
 conforming with them for any considerable space. On viewing
 a range of basaltic eminences stretching through a wide extent
 of country, or on inspecting a strong vein filled with this sub
 stance, one naturally considers the former to be links of a con
 nected chain, and the latter a fissure of vast range : but these
 appearances are frequently fallacious ; for the thickest beds be
 come thin, and soon terminate in the form of a wedge, and the'
 veins as suddenly disappear. For instance : the two large dykes
 explored at the surface by quarries, and below-ground by mines,
  at Walbottle and Coleyhill     (see the map of Northumberland)
 were not found a mile or two to the east, either in the workings
 of Montague main, or East Denton collieries, or intersecting the
 great level cut from south to north, between Bells, close by the
 Tyne to Kenton ; and the dyke at Walker, so well defmed and
 beautifully delineated by Mr. Hill, has not been noticed in the
 neighbourhood.      The inference             is,
                                          that all theories respecting
 the continuity oflasalt    are highly problematical     and that upon
                                                            ;
  treating on this peculiar species  of rock, one  should  be contented
 to speak of   itonly when      can be detected
                               it                      in
                                                     situ.
     3. Muscle shells, generally filled with clay iron-stone, are
                                                                  found

found in the shales both of the Newcastle coal-field, and in iuch
as do not lie very deep in the encrinal limestone formation gene
rally associated with the thickest seams of coal in that district.
The localities of these organic remains are tolerably numerous ;
but ironstone being an object of little consequence, notice has
seldom been taken of its beds or nodules, except when they have
been    denominated whinstone girdles in the colliery sections.
Recurring to our numerous strata of shale, it is impossible to say
to which they do or do not belong.
   4 and 5. My reason for thinking that the red sand-stone of the
Tees is covered by the Whitby alum-rock, has been stated at
some length in my tract on the east part of Yorkshire; but I have
not as yet been able to ascertain the fact. The paper in question
is by no means sufficiently perfect to meet the public eye; but
I flatter myself with the prospect of revisiting that part of the
kingdom during the course of the ensuing summer.
    May I now hope that the gentleman who signs himself A Con
stant Reader will inform me either by letter, or through the me
dium of your Magazine,
    1st, Whether he considers the; Whitby alum shale, and the
chinch clay of Lincolnshire, the same stratum ; and if the coal
field, covering the former, belongs to      or it,a distinct forma

and below    it ?

                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,      As the cause of the divergence of bodies equally elec
trified does not appear to be generally understood,   have taken  I
the liberty of submitting the following observations, which,                      if
vou think proper, you are at liberty to insert in your valuable
Magazine.
 I    am aware that Mr. Singer, in his excellent work on Elec
                                                                            tricity,

                     On the fixed Oil    of Wine, life.                   209
trieity,    has given  it as his opinion that bodies equally electrified
recede from each other,        being attracted by the surrounding air.
But as my experiments were made before I saw his work, and
they do not appear to interfere with his observations, it may not
be considered presumptuous in offering them to your notice.
 ,
     When two balls are electrified positively, the air intervening
between them, receiving a portion of the fluid from each of the
balls, becomes so highly electrified positively, that the external
air is comparatively electrified negatively ; consequently the mu
tual attraction between the air and balls being greatest in the op
posite directions *, the balls will recede from each other, being
oppositely attracted.
    Were the divergence caused by the attraction of the surround
ing air, the balls should not recede when electrified in vacuo J
whereas if it be the effect of electrical repulsion, the balls should
recede still more in vacuo, the resistance being lessened.
    To ascertain this, I used an air-pump with a glass plate, and
suspended' two small pith balls from a wire passing through the
Centre of a large receiver.
    When the receiver was partly exhausted, I electrified the balls,
and found the divergence was considerably lessened : but when
completely exhausted, there was not the slightest motion, percep
tible in the balls, although several successive sparks were com
municated from a Leyden jar.
     I then suspended the balls much nearer one side .of the re
ceiver than the other : and when electrified in vacuo, the result
was, that they were both equally attracted towards the nearest
side of the receiver.
     It therefore appears to me that we are justified in concluding
that the recession of bodies equally electrified is caused by the
attraction of the surrounding air : and certainly this hypothesis
is the most simple, and most congenial to the maxim  that we
should never bring two principles into action when only one is
necessary.                     I am, sir, yours, &c.

attraction for another body, in proportion as the other body is negatively
 electrified.

 Magazine ; but conceiving it highly imprudent to interfere with
the labours of others til! thev had been regularly published, 1 was
induced to refrain a while, anxiously waiting the arrival of that
period. Nor should 1 address you at present, had I not observed
(on perusing your last number, page 121,) that I have been anti
cipated by Mr. Murray in a manner which 1 did not expect.
Soon after Sir H. Davy's brilliant discovery (of the curious pheno
mena presented by platinum and palladium wires in inflammable
media) was made known, I was induced to try the effect of the
first metal in the vapour of oil of wine, where it continued " to
glow very vividly until the ethereal matter" was "all expended;"
when I discovered the "peculiar fixed oil " remaining in the ves
sel. I united it with the alkalies, and satisfied myself that it was
a " peculiar fixed oil " (which indeed i then termed it), by its
unctuous feel, and leaving a distinct semitransparent stain on
paper after having been heated. I ascertained that it was
                                                             " highly
inflammable," and of less specific gravity than water.
    Mr. M. happening to call on me a few days after, 1 informed
him of these experiments and their results ; though I by no means
wish to insinuate that he has' not-repeated them : nor should 4
have thought it worth while to notice this, had I not intimated
to him (at the time) my intention of communicating them to you;
and furthermore, received his entire acquiescence in its propriety.
Should you be enabled to find room to insert this in your next
number, you will much oblige, sir,

London,   March 18, 1817.                                J. FARLEY.
    P. S. From my experiments I should be inclined to consider
oil of wine to be sulphuric ether holding in solution the "pecu
liar fixed oil," and which is most probably formed by an altera
tion in the play of affinities exerted during the latter part of the
process for obtaining sulphuric ether. The "peculiar fixed oil"
(which is of a light yellow colour) may be obtained by merely
evaporating oil of wine with a gentle heat.

                     the Rev.  T. Drummond.

                           To  Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,           o man is wise at all hours" is a quaint remark,
and    I must rely on the appropriateness of its application to
apologize for the introduction of it at the commencement of my
letter.   The valuable annual publication by W. Frend, Esq. has
contributed, in no slight degree, to promote a familiar acquaint,-
                                                                an«e

  ance with the positions of the starry host, and the appellations ;
  which are usually given to the most conspicuous amongst them. .
      Evening Amusements for 1817 has this day been received,
   completing mv set of a work which I estimate not meanly.
      The patriot, the philosopher, the admirer of civil and religious
  liberty, may by some of his readers be suspected to have been
  planet-struck, or under the dire potency of Lunar influence; but
  with different impressions I have perused animadversions which
  do not manifest that spirit of liberality which I have long con
  sidered one of his characteristics.   If a few animadversions on
  the subject are admissible in your pages, I beg leave to offer
  them.
      There are some remarks on which I shall say nothing, not
  being disposed at this time to argue in defence of the dark-eyed,
i black-haired, wandering Sibyls, nor of those who practise what
  is commonly denominated astrology; neither have I any charge
  to bring against the spots on the sun on account of the late
  rainy season.    But that rain is produced by peculiar changes in
  ttje atmosphere, and there must be some preceding operations to
  occasion those changes, I presume is indisputable.       The ques
  tion then is  why not the motions of the planetary bodies ?
      Mr. Frend is not called upon to subscribe to the doctrine of
  planetary influence: but as dogmatism in science as wf-11 as re--
  ligion, whether on the orthodox or heterodox side of the ques
  tion, is not amiable ;  I wish to enter my protest against a sen
  timent which he publishes without any argument to support it.
  Whatever may be the views of the writer of Moore's Almanack,
   1 am persuaded that,    in avowing my opinion of planetary in
  fluence on the atmosphere, I do not act under a delusion, and
  feel confident that I harbour no wish to delude others.
      In opinions, as in the waters, there may hi flows and ebbs;;
   and some persons' do not hesitate to ascribe them alike to the
  influence of the planets.    Whatever unknown cause may pro
   duce the former, I cannot see why the correctness of the now
   generally received opinion respecting the latter should be de
   nied.
      I remember that in 1 811, on reading Evening Amusements for
   February, I inferred that Mr. Frend was a believer at least in
   atmospherical astrology ; and although the publication for the
   present year is replete with sentiments in opposition; perhaps,-
   like the planets themselves, they may appear retrograde for
   a season, and then become direct.
      We read, p. 21 : " Freedom of mind is a blessing which can
   not be appreciated by those who have it not, nor too highlv
   valued by those who are in possession of it."    Again : " I write
                                 0  2                              'for

2i2       Remarks on   Mr.     Freud's   "Evening Amusements."
far those who wiH allow me the same freedom I wish them to
enjoy." This is rational, this is friendly.
    I presume the work is in the hands of your readers, and shall
forbear making many extracts. There is one in 18111 must quote,
and two short paragraphs in 1817, which cannot be passed un
noticed.    The writer of Moore's Almanack is harshly treated,
the speculators on the changes of the moon are severely lam
pooned ; and although it is consistent with freedom of thought
to admire the wonderful scene of the constellations, and the
grand progress of the moau among her starry contemporaries,
thus far we are allowed to be free, and no further.
    Mr. F. says there are numerous diaries kept, relative to the
weather " not only in our own island, but upon the continent.
 I have not thought it worth while to examine any of them, but I
know a very respectable clergyman who kept a diary of this
kind for thirty-five years, and he upon examination could not
find the least connexion between the moon and the weather."
This, sir, is an instance of implicit confidence I never expected
to hear from a philosopher :  the mode of observation is un
known, it might be totally erroneous; but as Mr. F. did not think
it worth while to examine         it,

may not be persuaded by any thing contained therein to revoke
my opinion, that not the moon only but the constellations, the

S.tR,  JThk exhibition announced in p- 464 of yonr last volume,
has at length begun to take place, and doubts can no longer be
 entertained,whether compound Stops on Organs; capable of being
perfectly tune d, would be equally gratifying to the Ear, with
 chords on simple stops, involving none or fewer discords in their
 composition ; and the results have been most satisfactory and gra
 tifying to several select parties of Professors and Amateurs.
 Mr. Purkis displayed much taste and execution in exhibiting
 the Instrument : among the many full pieces which he played,
 was the Hallelujah Chorus in 5 sharps ; the very novel and fine
 effect of which, struck every oije.       Several of the most unusual
 and extraneous modulations and enharmonic changes of mo
 dern Composers were exhibited, with new and very gratifying
 effects, such, 'as perhaps the Composers themselves were in part
 unaware of.        In mv latest visits at Messrs. Flight and Robson's
 a- printed paper was put into my hands, which 1 wish to see pre
 served in your pages: it seems to proceed on, and with good
 effect to follow up, what is stated in vol. xxxix. p. 420, and
 other parts of your very valuable work.
     I hope some of the able Professors and Composers who are

 amongst its cotetnporaries, for its correct- and luminous exposi

        There are in the Scale of 39 Notes on this Instrument, two
exceedingly small, and vet highly important Intervals (called
 Schismas), between Cb and B', and between Cv and B'*, which
prove to be the Units of the Scale ; in terms of which, every
possible Interval on this Intrument, or even on one of a far more
extended Scale, can be arithmetically expressed and compared,
with the utmost ease and accuracy, by every Musician who is
ready at addition and subtraction ; qualifications, in which it
would be a libel on the Readers of this, to suppose them wanting.

minor Tone is 93, the major Tone is 104, the major Third is
 197, the major Fifth is 358, and the Octave is 61*2, of these
Schisma Units, respectively.
     " The tuning of this Organ, has been wholly conducted by
help of the three last mentioned concords, the Third, Fifth, and
 Octave, each tuned quite perfect (without even the slowest Beats,
which it was possible to detect), and according to the process
which is described in the first 7 and in the 44th and 45th pages
of Mr. Liston's*" Essay on perfect Intonation" (which is on

tages of this invention, made several journeys to Munich, in order

   Although sinylar to engraving, lithography       yet something        is
very different.               It

in as far as     an art of multiplying indefinitely the same de

            It
copies of designs, but the designs themselves  the original
works of the designer repeated as often as impressions of
thern can be taken. Lithography then may be regarded as th«

     The facts on which the lithographic art is founded are the re*

next applied to the stone (as in letter-press printing), it will
only attach itself to the lines formed by the oily ink, and will be
rejected by the moistened parts.
     The lithographic process, in short, depends on this : that the
stone, moistened with water, rejects the ink ; and when oiled,
 that it rejects the water and retains the ink : so that in applying
 and pressing a leaf of paper upon the stone, the oily, resinous^
 and coloured lines will alone be transferred to                it,
                                                                presenting the
 counter-impression      of what      represented
                                       is             on  the  stone.
     The design, instead of being traced in reverse Upon the stone,
 may be drawn with prepared ink, on paper, and thence trans
 ferred to the stone     ;     which means the stone will then return
                              by
 the exact image of the original.
     All stones will do for the purpose, which are susceptible of be
 ing penetrated     by  any oily substance, and of imbibing water witfc
 facility provided they are compact, of clear and uniform co
         ;                                                  a
  lour, and capable of receiving         fine polish. The whole of these
                                            a
 qualities are verv happily combined in certain calcareous stones,
 which are found in the quarries of Solen Hofen, near Pappenheim
  in Bavaria, and may be met with,                 believed, in several other

      When the stone     is dressed and polished, the artist may, with
  out any other preparation, sketch his design upon                   it,
                                                                     either with
   crayon, pen, or pencil.      The grain     of  the  stone   being more fine
   and equal than that of the fmest and best pressed vellum, he will
   fmd himself enabled to draw his lines with so much the greater
   equality, firmness, and delicacy.                          .

 uses, is described as " different from all other presses        but we

     In order to ascertain the full value of this invention, it remains
 still to be known whether any given number of impressions
 equally beautiful can be taken, and what that number is. In the
 first essays of the art, it is certain that a very great inequality in
 the impressions was experienced : and although it is said that
 M. Engelmann has devised means of apportioning with the most
 scrupulous exactness the quantity of the different ingredients,
 and of retouching his designs from time to time, no results are
 stated to enable us to form a satisfactory conclusion on the points
 we have stated.                                 ,

    Feb. 27.   At the instance    of the President, Sir E, Home fur
nished some descriptive observations on the fossil bones found
by Mr. Whitby, the superintendant of the works, in the quarry
whence the stone for the Plymouth Break-water is extracted.
These bones were found about 70 feet below the surface of the
ground, and four above high-water mark, in a cavern which is
nearly opposite to, and at a little distance from, the works now
carrying on at Plymouth. The bones are more perfect, and freer
from extraneous matter, than any other fossil bones hitherto
found.     The cavern has no incrustations on its sides, no exter
nal communication, and no appearance of infiltration ; its bot*
tom, in which the bones were deposited, is filled with clay, three
feet of which covered thein,       The bones found by Mr. Whitby,
and sent by him to Sir Joseph Banks, belonged to three different'
animals of the rhinoceros species, and are larger than those in
Mr. Brooks's Museum.           According to Mr. Brando's analysis,
they contain little but the usual contents of bones, and have very
little earthy or extraneous matter.       It appears that there are
two kinds of stone used in constructing the Break-water, and
that the one being much harder than the other, a different price
is paid for raising it ; but the part in which the bones were
found is of the harder kind, and for which the greatest price b
paid for quarrying.
    March 6. The Rev. Mr. Hyde Wollaston gave the Society a
description of an instrument which he has lately invented for
 measuring altitudes, and which he calls a thermometrical baro
 meter.     Every one who has attempted to use the common moun
tain barometer has experienced the difficulty, and almost impos
 sibility, of preserving it without fracture.    To remedy this, Mr.
 Wollaston, observing the striking difference in the temperature
 of water according to the atmospheric pressure, instituted a
 series of sxperiments, in order to construct a thermometer which
 should answer all the purposes of measuring heights with ex
                                                               treme

tremc accuracy, and at the same time be more portable, less
liable to break, and in every respect more useful than the baro
meter.      He began by taking smail thermometric tabes, giving
them large bulbs, and extending thetn to three inches for every
degree of Fahpenheit's scale. These he found very sensible; but
for general purposes he considers that one inch to every degree
of Fahrenheit (each of which he divided into a thousand de
grees) is the most convenient; that the eapillary tubes should
not be so small as to present any great resistance to the expan
sion of the mercury; and that a tube of common diameter, having
 a bulb inserted in a metal box about four inches long and 1-4
wide, will indicate every foot of elevation.       To this box water is
 added,, and a small lamp placed under             it,
                                                so that the water may
 boil and as the operator ascends, the ascent of the mercury at the
    ;
 boiling point indicates the difference of height between any one
 place and the common surface of the earth, or the level of the.
 sea.    Mr.Wollaston made an experiment with his instrument by
 boiling water on the counter of           bookseller's shop in Pater
                                           a

                                      it
 found that this thermometer exactly corresponded with the geo
 metric measurement of that building.

 the substance of     some papers transmitted to him from Dorches

                                                         a
 vered in an immense subterranean cavern in the State of Ken
 tucky.

222           Bath Literary and Philosophical Society.
    The mummy      is that of a stout woman nearly sixfeet in height,'
though    the  whole  materiel is so intensely dry as to weigh but
twenty pounds.
    It was found in the cavern at the distance of three miles from
its entrance.    The figure appeared seated in a sort of rude sar- '
cophagus composed of five limestone slabs 5 the fifth stone
sewing as a cover or entablature to the rest, exactly similar to'
the ancient cromlechs still extant in various places of the British
islands.    The knees had been brought close up to the body;  the
hands were clasped upon the breast ;  the head, covered, with
something like a coronet, was erect ;  and the whole figure was *
muffled up and covered with a number of garments made of wild
hemp and willow bark.         Several bags containing beads, trinkets,
and various handicraft implements were lying by the body, with
a sort of work-basket, a curious musical instrument, and a fan
made of feathers a la Vandyke.
    The entrance of the cavern is forty feet high by thirty feet
wide, and for some years past saltpetre has been made and
oxen worked as far as two miles within it.          A Mr. Ward has
recently explored      this wonderful   cavern  to  the extent of ten
miles.     He says that after having proceeded some miles they
ascended a vertical chimney-like passage, and climbing up from
one stone to another about forty feet, they entered at midnight
a chamber 1800 feet in circumference, and 150 feet high in the-
centre !     From this chamber they proceeded about a mile
farther, and how much further they might have gone they knew
not.    In another chamber which they traversed, they were pre
sented with a scene to which there is at present, perhaps, no
parallel in natural history  a single arch of solid rock 100 feet
bigh projecting over an area of not less than eight acres ! From
the observations which they made, they fully satisfied themselves
of this further astonishing fact,-^that Green River, a mighty
stream navigable for several hundreds of miles, must necessarily
have passed over their heads in three different branches: of the
cavern.
   A great many discoveries, it is added in the communication to
Mr. Cranch, have been made in Kentuaky, which indicate the
existence at some very remote period of a state of society, arts,
and social habits far more advanced than any of the aboriginal
tribes hitherto known have exhibited.
   A paper by Dr. Wilkinson On the Rise of Fluids in capillary
Tubes was afterwards read. Its object was to show that the
experiments on this subject do not accord with the theoretic
calculations of Professor Atwood of Cambridge, and other philo
sophers ;  that the results do not correspond with any fixed rule,
but are entirely dependent on certain conditions of the tube }

    Monday, March 10.         Dr. Wilkinson stated, that he had re
 ceived a letter from Mr. Bakewell, author of The Elements of
 Geology of England, intimating that he had discovered in the
neighbourhood of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, basalt with coral
 and shells imbedded in it; a circumstance difficult to reconcile
with the theory of basalt being of igneous origin.           The learned
Doctor also exhibited a specimen of the fruit of the locust-tree,
the hymencea of the West Indies.           It is a large pod containing
seeds surrounded by a saccharine pulp.           Dr. W. remarked, that,
it had been supposed by somc, that this constituted the food of
 St. John in the Wilderness.         In Arabia, Numidia, Abyssinia,
 and even among the Hottentots, the locust' insect is a favourite
article of food, and used both in its recent and preserved state.
The locust alluded to in the Scriptures, is supposed to mean li
terally the insect, and the wild honey a species of manna.
    A communication, from a member, relative to the appearance
of the aurora borealis, asseeriin Derby and its neighbourhood on
 Saturday the 8th of February last, was next read.            It   was ob
 served by Mr. Horner, that the reappearance of these lights
militates against the theory advanced by Dalton and Darwin,
of the coincidence of the vertex of these irradiations with the
line of no variation of the needle. The variation of the needle,
as observed at different periods at Greenwich, is as follows :
      In 1580,  11° 15' eastward      In 1745,    18°  6' westward
         1622,   6   0    ditto           1751, 19      0    ditto

    Between    1657 and 1790 the annual average was nearly 12*
 I S".   After having   been many years stationary, the needle is
now returning to the north.
    The discussion of Dr. Wilkinson's Theory on the Rise of Fluids
 in capillary Tubes next occupied the attention of the Society.
 The Doctor remarked, that from experiments it appeared that
the rise of fluids is not .exactly as the reverse of the diameters,
 but nearly so ; the columnar pressure of fluids being as the area
 of the base multiplied by the perpendicular height.          Hence with
 equal heights   the pressure   will be as  the  squares  of their  diame
 ters ; so that in a tube of one-tenth of an inch, and another of
 one-twentieth, to render the quantum of water in each tube the
jsanae as asserted by Professor Atwood, the fluid ought to rise
 four times higher in the smaller tube than in the larger, which

    noway aceords with the experiments made.            Whatever quantum
    of fluid any tube will suspend, will also be the measure of the
   mechanical resistance of the fluid with respect to the tube.          If
    the columnar pressure and the resistance were the same, there
    would be no difference in the levels.       As the ratio of the co
   lumnar pressure exceeds the resistance in the same degree as
   the squares of the diameters exceed the proportion of the dia
   meters, so the fluid will rise to a height above the level of the fluid
   exterior to the, tube in the same proportion.        Supposing a tube
   immersed one inch in a vessel of water, and the resistance equal
   to half an inch  in this state the fluid will rise half an inch within
   the tube ; arid it might then, be supposed that a balance would
   take place, and that a depression instead of an elevation of the
   fluid would be the consequence.        In this position- the columnar
  pressure of the fluid becomes as nothing, for it is supported by
  the mechanical resistance of. the sides of the tube :. hence the
  pressure of the external fluid determines more towards the tube;
  and the operation may be considered a6 continuing until the
  fluid within the tube is of the same height as the fluid on the
  outside, plus that portion, wbiqh jfju the measure of the resist
  ance of the fluid against the sides of the tube.
      The resistance of fluids against the sides of tubes Dr. W. re
  ferred to the same mechanical cause which occasions two leaden
  hemispheres with polished surfaces to cohere most powerfully
 when brought into contact.            This cohesion, the Doctor ob
 served, does not take place, unless a rotatory motion is induced
 on the hemispheres when in contact; nor can they be easily se
 parated unless by a similar motion.         When the surfaces are ex
 amined, particles of lead appear raised up from the surface of
 each hemisphere, and closely locked together ; the resistance to
 separation is in proportion to the number of particles thus en
 tangled ; but unless the metal is soft, no such effect takes place.
 Experiments were made with hemispheres of lead and tin, and
 tin and brass. It has been stated that polished brass hemi
spheres will strongly adhere, if their surfaces be smeared with oil.
Dr. W. maintained that the interposition of any substance be
tween metallic plates must tend to keep the metallic surfaces at
a greater distance, contrary to the admitted laws of attraction
heing in the inverse duplicate' ratio of the distances ; the cohesion
in this instance he conceived to he merely referable to the te
nacity of the oil.

Vice-President, " On the Methods of making the different Pre
parations of Arsenic in Saxony, and on the Process of preparing
Smalt or -Cobalt in Bohemia;" accompanied with illustrative
specimens and drawings.      The author observed, that during his
travels upon the continent he had had the good fortune to be
admitted into the different mining works ; and that as he exa
mined them in detail, he considered that by giving publicity to
such information he might be of service to the county of Corn
wall, especially as he had heard that an establishment in the
county had to contend with very considerable difficulties in
making the different preparations of arsenic ; and it was notorious
that cobalt was imported from Saxony at the very time that Ores
of that metal were found in very considerable quantities in Corn
wall.    A large collection of original and beautiful drawings' il
lustrative of the different machines used in the Saxon mines,
together with several models and a complete dress of a Saxon
miner, were also presented by the author.
    Dr. Paris presented to the Society a geological pillar in
tended to exhibit in one view all the different rock-formations,
and the relative order in which they o6eur.      The pillar is four
teen feet in height, and composed of spiral shelves, which carry
specimens of the different rocks and wind from the base to the
capital round a central shaft ; the whole pillar is made to revolve
upon its base, so that each specimen may be successively brought
into view. Its appearance is altogether very novel and striking.
Dealers in minerals will probably derive an useful hint from it,
and adopt a similar method for exposing their specimens to in
spection.
   The Rev. Win. Gregor communicated some specimens of a
mineral of rare occurrence in Cornwall, but which has been lately
found in Pengelly Mine in the parish of St. Ewe ; it is a com
pound of arsenic and nickel, and has the name of kupfernicketi
    Dr. Paris presented a most interesting account of the acci
dents which occur from casual explosion in the mines of Corn
wall, and on the methods of preventing it.
   A Committee was appointed to     devise means for establishing,
w.ith an appropriate   endowment,  a Professorship of Mineralogy
and Geology.

proved of this legacy, the Academy published last, year a pro
gram descriptive of the art, the inconveniences of which are,
sought to be removed ; and pointing out those particular opera
tions in which the danger is greatest : but no satisfactory memoir
dn the subject having been presented, the Academy resolved
to propose the subject anew for the vear 1818.       It is required
that the competitors shall put in practice in some workshop in
Paris the processes which they propose ; and that these pro
cesses shall be such, that besides effecting the principal object
in view, they may combine some means of re-collecting the eva
porated mercury.      The period of competition is limited to the;
 1st of January 1818, and the result will be published the first
 Monday of March 1818.

    Two other prizes which the Academy had announced last
year remaining also unmerited by any of the memoirs which
they have called forth, the Academy resolved to propose them in
like manner again for the year 1818.

   The Academy also resolved to propose the following subject
for another prize in  physics, to be adjudged in the public sitting
of March 1819: " To determine             by

          SNAKE OR ADDER FOtTND IN A BLOCK OF COAL.
 XN' a recent number of the PliiTosriphical Magazine we gave a
 communication on the singular Circumstance of two lizards hav
 ing been discovered in a chalk-ibed in Suffolk, sixty feet below
 the surface.     The publication of this fact has given rise to the
 following   affidavit  of a similar discovery by two pitmen in the
 county   of Stafford.     " We, William Mills and John Fisher, both
of the parish of Tipton in the eounty of Stafford, do hereby cer
tify and declare, that a few years ago in working in a certain
 coalpit belonging to the Right Honourable Viscount Dudley and
Ward, at what is called the Pieces in the parish of Tipton afore
said, and on cleaving or breaking the stratum of coal called the
stone coal, which is about four feet thick, and in that situation
lies about fifty yards from the earth's surface^ we discovered a liv
ing reptile of the snake or adder kind, lying coiled up, imbedded
in a small hollow cell within the said solid coal, which might be
about 20 tons in weight.        The reptile when discovered visibly
moved, and soon afterwards crept out of the hole; but did not
live longer than ten minutes on being exposed to the air, when
it naturally diedj not having been at all hurt by the cleaving of
the coal, whose thickness and solidity must have kept it before
from all air.     The hollow in which it lay was split or cloven in
two by means of an iron wedge ; and was rather moist at the
bottom, but had no visible water. It was nearly the size of a com
mon tea-saucer; and the reptile was about nine inches long, of
a darkish ashy colour, and a little speckled.       After it was dead
it was thrown aside ; and the large coal in which it lay, being

        "  After having   observed       the progress of the machine at the

   down to clear the shaft, and have not since ceased working an
   irjstant.    The clearing of the mud and rubbish which had re
                                                                         mained

the buckets and suckers of the engine, lasted till Wednesday ;
but this being accomplished, at twelve o'clock at noon they be
gan to break through the level          At half a yard below the shaft
we found a lively coppery ore, with its particles of silver.       This
 bronze-coloured ore indicates that the veins of Yauricocha and
San Diego mines incline to the west, or towards the Santa Rosa
mine. The mines in the vicinity of this pit are all dry. Some of
them, at the distance of 300 yards, in the ridge of Santa Rita,
have also felt its effects ; and even as far as the territory of Caya,
behind our steam-works, the waters have fallen in several mines.
   "  Dr. John Vayas has begun to work in San Diego mine.
They are also going next Monday to begin working in several
points of the Santa Rosa mine.         They are already eight yards in
depth,   and  we  are  proceeding   with  the greatest activity.   The
workmen are relieved every two hours ; and as they go out they
give up their tools to those who succeed them, by which means
not a minute is lost. Continuing thus, in the course of a month
we shall be at more than twenty yards depth, and have many
mines in full activity. The winding engine raises a basket (which
is a load) in two minutes ; the draining or steam-engine, with
two strokes per minute, keeps the surface always dry. Both work
with the greatest ease, certainty, and regularity.
    " By dint of searching after a vein of coal, we haVe at last
found one near at hand, of excellent quality, and of great rich
ness. The pit which we now work is at the distance of a quarter
of a league from Rancas, and at the same distance from Vista
Alegre which the Cerro is from these works.          We have likewise
found a vein of plumbago, which was an object of search, on the
supposition that it was coal.       This substance, of which much is
consumed, mixed with grease, to soften the friction of the piston,
&c. we have now here, and thus the necessity of sending to Lima,
or perhaps to Europe, for it, is obviated."

   "Sir,  The report     in your last number, of experiments on black
barley by  a noble  earl, whose  exertions in promoting the prosperity
 of the agricultural interests of the nation cannot be too highly
commended, deserves great consideration.          But I beg leave, with
much deference, to suggest, that from the various condition in
which barley was last year harvested in different districts, as well as
by different persons in the same district, one or two experiments
ought not to be relied upon as sufficient authority for general
practice.    I have myself made the following :  On the 4th of
February I planted, in a warm aspect, 100 kernels of black bar-

individual informing himself hy actual experiment of the fitness

     THE EBBING AND FLOWING STREAM IN THE HARBOUR OF

                      BRIDLINGTON, YORKSHIRE.
     About six years ago Mr. Reiitiie, civil engineer, recommended
 that a stratum of clay in the quay of Bridlington should be exa
 mined by boring, to ascertain its' depth, with a vievy to forward
 some improvements         then in contemplation for that harbour.
 This explorement was begun under the inspection of Mr. Milne,
 collector of the customs ; and the result was, besides a perfect
 knowledge of the different strata, the discovery of a most sini
 gular stream of pure, soft, and limpid water, which regularly
 ebbs and flows twice a-day with the ocean ; recedes totally with
 each reflux of the tide ; is propelled with some force as this ad
 vances ; and is evidenly more agitated during a storm, particu
  larly at the increscent period of the tide.
     These and other peculiarities, with the whoje history of the
 discovery, are already before the public.         They w«re communi
 cated by Dr. Storer of Nottingham to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph
 Banks, P.R.S.        These may be seen in the Transactions of the
 Royal Society for 1815, part I. and in the Philosophical Maga^

     This curious spring has been found to possess many excellent
 properties ; and it has been administered in numberless cases of
 chronic disease, with decided benefit to the constitution of in
 valids.    The water has been lately analvsed at the request of a
 gentleman of great respectability, who, from motives of general
 advantage, has published the analysis, with the intention, we
 believe, of its being distributed gratuitously, chiefly amongst his
 friends.                                                               We

 ,  We have hot yet seen the report of this analysis, which, we
find, is from Mr. Hume of Long Acre, to whom samples :of the
water were sent from Yorkshire.        The general result, however,
we can now lay before our readers. He found, that great purity
is one of its most distinguishing      properties; that as far as the
incomplete analysis of the Malverne Well, which has long been
published, will allow of a comparison, the Bridlington stream
is not less pure ; that although this stream is so nearly con
nected with the sea, under which its whole vicinity is placed
twice a-riay, yet it is altogether exempt from muriate of soda,
from any kind of sulphate, and from magnesia.            According to-
Mr. Hume's experiments, this ebbing and flowing stream is very
little heavier than distilled water. It contains no other aeriform,
substance than carbonic acid. The solid contents of a wine-gallon
amount to 13 grains and a fraction ; and these consist of

  the extremity of the progress into the interior, a distance of 30
  miles, it was observed that the ravines only were covered with a
  thick mould ; the rest of the ground was rocky and full of stones.
  The conjecture formed was, that there is a junction of the two
  rivers, the Congo and Niger ; but from the number of cataracts
  and rapids which occur in the course of the Congo, such a junction
  could be of no avail in a navigable point of view. The scientific
  gentlemen, it is added, employed in the expedition, felt no inter
  est in exploring this desert region, beyond what arose from the
  mere circumstance of their treading upon ground which till then
  had never been trod by any European.
      It is with extreme regret we have to add, that intelligence has
 just been received that Major Peddie, who commanded the other
  expedition intended to penetrate from Senegal through the de
  serts to the banks of the Niger, has also fallen a victim to his
  spirit of enterprise. He. died before. he had reached the banks of

     (From a Correspondent.) Mr. Pettigrew, in his Memoirs of
 the Life and Writings of the late Dr. Lettsom
         " It was Dr. L. who                         (vol. i. page 121),
 says,                        first sent the vaccine lymph across the
 Atlantic, and consigned it to the fostering care of Dr. Waterhouse,
  Professor of the theory and practice of medicine in the Univer
 sity of Cambridge,Massachusetts,from        whence it spread through
 the United States." This was stated

     [While on this subject, we may       add  one  other  fact, a recent
 occurrence, which will probably fill no unimportant place in thte
 history of Vaccination :  In the electorate of Hesse a decree has
just been promulgated, by which every father of a family is de
 clared liable to a fine for each of his children who shall have at
tained the age of one vear without being vaccinated. The fine is

                              SHIP PUMPS.
     The following simple and ingenious method of working         a ship's
 pumps, when     the crew are  either too  few in number,    or too much
 exhausted to attend to that duty when its performance is most
 necessary, namely, in a heavy gale, was put in practice with great
 success by Captain Leslie of the ship George and Susan, on a late
 voyage from Stockholm to North America. He fixed a spar aloft,
 one end of which was ten or twelve feet above the top of his
 pumps, and the other projected over the stern. To each end he
 affixed a block or pulley.     He then fastened a rope to the spears
 of the pump; and, after passing' it through both pulleys along
 the spar, dropped it into the sea astern. To the rope he "fastened
 a cask of 1 10 gallons measurement, and containing CO or 70 gal
 lons of water.     This cask answered as a balance weight ; and
 every motion of the ship from the roll of the sea made the ma
 chinery work. When the stem of the ship descended, or when
  a sea or any agitation of the water raised the cask, the pump
 spears descended ; and the contrary motions of the ship raised
 the spears when the water flowed out. The ship was cleared in
 this way in four hours ; and the crew, of course, were greatly
                                                  -

     Mr.W. K. Northall,F.A.S., of Salop- House, Wolverhampton,
  announces that he has discovered a method of propelling boats
  by steam in a manner superior to every thing that has yet ap
  peared.     The velocity of the boat may by this plan be easily
  increased from three to seven miles an hour.             The weight of
  the machinery will not be more than three tons; the space it
  will occupy is comparatively small. An experiment was made
  on Thursday the 20th of March, with a model of a boat and
  the appropriate machinery, in the presence of a number of
  competent judges, and the result is said to have been most sa

    Mock Moon.  At    eleven o'clock P.M. on Monday the 24th of
March, a luminous paraselene, or mock moon, was observed at
Clapton by Mr. Thomas Forster.         It appeared at about 25 de
grees from the moon, in the northern side, and at the same
elevation above the horizon.      An oblong band of light extended
from it.    It lasted about five minutes, and was produced by the
refraction of the light through a fine veil of the wane cloud or
cirrostratus.
                           Aurora Borealis.   .
    Observations on the recent appearance of the aurora bo
realis in southern latitudes were stated in our last to have been
made in France as well as in this country.      The following is an
interesting account of its appearance at Paris on the same day as
it was observed here, (the 8th of February,) and about the same
hour, nine in the evening.
    " The sky was clear , and there were seen about the zenith
spots of a white hue, like the tail of a comet.       A bright light
like that of the dawn appeared in the north. On the i|iiays, the
bridges, and all open places, the .crowd stopped to admire this
rare phenomenon.        But to enjoy the sight in all its sublimity it
was necessary to ascend the platform of some lofty edifice.        At
such an elevation, where one commanded the horizon, there was
beheld a dazzling circle of several degrees in breadth, extending
from east to west.      In the interior of this circle the obscurity
was complete ; and the stars of the smallest magnitude coidd be
perceived.     From the exterior part there darted from time to
time innumerable beams of a white and faintly tinged light ;
which joining at the zenith, and even at the south, formed im
mense sheets, and shrunk together rapidly like a fisherman's net.
The beams which issued from the extremity of the arch, at first
yellowish and then orange-coloured, soon became of a deep red ;
and the constellation of the Bear, hardly visible through this ter
rible brightness, seemed bathed in blood. The sky became at last
covered with clouds, and the phsenomenon disappeared."
    This remarkable aurora was observed on the same evening
throughout the south of Germany.          The appearances seem to
have been on the whole much the same as at Paris, only in some
 places fainter than in others.    Mr. Stark at Augsburg observed,
 that Volta's electrometer and the magnetic needle were almost
 constantly in motion.     At half-past eight the western variation
 of the needle increased 1° 30' : in a quarter of an hour its oscil
 lations were quicker ; and at 18 minutes past nine its increased
 western variation was 2° 7'. At a quarter before ten the .needle
 became more steady, and returned slowly to 18° 29', where it was
 before the phenomenon.

LXtl.     Remarks on a Paper by Mr.        Dalton   on the Chemical
    Compounds    of Azote and Oxygent      &c.   By William Hig-*
    gins, Esq.
                            Tp  Mr. Tilloch
Sir,       You   will oblige me by inserting in your candid and
useful Magazine the following remarks on a paper of Mr. Dal-
ton on the Chemical Compounds of Azote and Oxygen, &c. which
appeared in the number of Dr. Thomson's Annals of Philosophy
for February.
    It is stated that this paper was read before the Literary and
Philosophical Society of Manchester in the year 1816. That
it should lie by since is not to be wondered at, as containing no
thing new ; it rehites to a hackneyed subject, which chemists
have lately gone over repeatedly.
    In that part of my paper which appeared in your excellent
Magazine for December 1816, I observed that Dr. Thomson
stepped forward repeatedly in a very unjust cause, which could
bever do him credit, as the advocate of Mr. Dalton, while the
latter stood silent and trembling at the bar of justice.
     In consequence of the above observation it was, I suppose,
that his friend urged him on with his tale, which is obscurely and
contradictorily told ; and I may add evasively and unjustly so, re
 specting myself.     But the sole object was to say something ort
 any part of my system with a view to show his face and a confi
dence of his innocence, at the same time that no mention should
 be made of the person whom he so glaringly attempted to injure.
     I will now give a very cursory view of this paper, for more is
hot necessary. " Lavoisier (he says) was the first who ascer
tained the constituents of the atmosphere, thirty years ago."
     Priestley was before Lavoisier in the discovery I but it is of no
 consequeuce, as to my present object, which of them was first or
 second, except in point of justice, which we should never lose
 sight of as men or philosophers.         But Mr. Dalton goes on,
 " Lavoisier in consequence of vague and contradictory expressions
 was not decided whether the oxygen and azote of the atmosphere
 were mixed only, or chemically united ; and as in his table of
 binary combinations of azote with simple substances no men
 tion is made of atmospheric air being one of them, it is likely he
 considered it as a simple mixture."
    This is puerile : there is no chemical combination of azote and
oxygen in the proportion in which they exist in our atmosphere ;
 and were they chemically united, it would be unfit to support
 animal life.
      Chaptal comes next.
                                 " He was decisively of opinion that
 Vol. 49. No. 228. April 1817.                 Q                    our

  242             Remarks on a Paper by    Mr. Dalton
 our atmosphere consisted of a mixture of oxygen and azote. Sir
  H. Davy considered the constituents of the atmosphere as che
  mically-united ; and his reasons for supposing so are adduced, but
  must be relinquished as ill founded, &c."
     Mr. Dalton next alludes to his Essays on the Constitution of
 mixed Gases, published in 1802; containing an hypothesis to
 explain the uniform diffusion of gases by mechanical means. On
 this principle, the atmosphere was considered a mixture not a
 combination of its elements.
     Before I proceed any further with Mr. Dalton's paper, I will
 in a few words mention. the prominent features of his hypothesis.
 He supposes that one gas affords a vacuum in its interstices for
 a second gas of a different nature from itself, and that each par
 ticle of the same gas in the mixture presses only on its kindred
 particle ; so that the pressure of each of the different gases which
 constitute our atmosphere is independent of the other ; not one
 of them pressing on the other, but all distinctly with one uniform
 weight rest on the surface of the earth.       The same law holds
 good as to the mixture of other gases.         .
     This is a strange hypothesis, which one cannot well reconcile
 to common sense.      All kinds of gases mix uniformly, and there
 are many gases whose ultimate divisions are of the same size,
 and some gases whose ultimate particles are much smaller than
 others ; yet their atmospheres of caloric are often larger.     The.
 calorific atmospheres of hydrogen are larger than those of oxygen.
 There are some gases whose atmospheres are of the same size ; 
 how then can all gases indiscriminately afford vacant interstices
 one for the other ?
    Suppose two parts of one gas were mixed with twenty parts
 of another gas,  how could the particles of the small quantity
 of gas extend their pressure to each other only, when such a
number of the particles of the predominating gas must be in
their way ?     It appears to me more reasonable to suppose that
under those circumstances the different kinds of particles or their
atmospheres, which is the same in effect, must rest indiscrimi
nately on each other.
    Many objections have been made to this hypothesis, and many
more might be brought forward were it considered necessary.
    I do riot make these cursory remarks with a view to completely
invalidate this hypothesis, for they are not sufficient to accom
plish such an object.     My reason for taking any notice of those
fanciful conceptions will appear presently. I must say that it is
the only part of his New System of Chemical Philosophy
that he has not borrowed; for the principal and most interesting
part was taken from my Comparative View, as had been clearly
proved by many, and lately confirmed by mv own writings.
                                                                 But

 on the Chemical Compounds      of Azote   and Oxygen,   &c.   243 '
  But to return to the subject of atmospheric air and    its gases.
"     Soon after this appeared (meaning his hypothesis of mixed
gases)   Berthollet, in his Researches into the Laws of Chemical
Affinity, announced a -new explanation on the phenomena of
mixed gases.      According to this eminent chemist, there are two
species of affinity ; the one strong, the other weak :  the strong
affinity makes bodies unite chemically ; the weak only serves to
diffuse them through each other without producing condensation
of volume ; its effects may be called solution or dissolution. Of
this kind, he conceives, is the mutual, action of gases that do
not combine, and that it operates just the same upon gases in
clined to combination or not:  thus a mixture of carbonic acid
gas and hydrogen is subject to this weak or slight affinity just as
much as one of oxygen and hydrogen.           Something similar to
this is supported by Murray in his Elements of Chemistry, and
 by Dr. Thomson in the third edition of his Chemistry.          Mr.
 Gough in different papers in the Manchester Memoirs, and in
 some essays of his in Nicholson's Journal, endeavoured to sup
 port the opinion of atmospheric air being a chemical compound;
 but he does not avail himself of the two affinities of the strong
 and the weak, in order to explain the phenomena of mixed gases."
 Here ends Mr. Dalton's old detail ; and had he given a true his
 tory one might probably read it without disgust.
    The distinction of weak and strong affinity is of considerable
 importance in Nature, and they should be well understood and
 defined from each other.      What is called weak affinity does not
 only prevail between permanent gases, but also between those
 gases and the vapour of water and all other vapours, and even
 between fluids and solid substances.
     I will now prove that 1 was the first who made this important
 distinction between weak and strong affinity twenty-eight vears
  ago.    At that distant period I felt doubtful whether the sulphur
  and hydrogen in sulphuretted hydrogen gas were chemically
  united or not, from the great facility with which they were se
  parated in a variety of ways.    This consideration led to the fol
  lowing remarks, which I quote from page 73 of my Comparative
 View.
   " In my opinion it is    mere solution (that  is,
                                                   that the sulphur
 is held in solution bythe hydrogen), such as takes place between
 the neutral salts and water, the alkalies and water, and sugar and
 water, &c.    Although the facility with which sulphuretted      hy
 drogen  is decomposed favours this hypothesis, yet there are cir
 cumstances apparently against it, particularly its condensation
 in water, and its expulsion from it again  by heat without decom

 between bodies, has not been explained ; and the difference be
  tween it and chemical union has never been denned or discri
  minated by chemists.
   "     It appears to me that solution, or that power by which water
  dissolves or condenses carbonic acid gas, pure ammoniacal gas,
 sulphureous acid gas; and that power by which hydrogen dis
 solves sulphur and phosphorus ; and also that power by which
 all the gases dissolve water; and lastly, that by which water dis
 solves saline bodies, &c. without changing their nature or pro
  perties, is occasioned by a sort of intermediate attraction, not
 differing much from chemical influence but in its degrees of force,
  and not at all different from that power whereby the planets in
  fluence each other."
      There was an idea entertained about this time, that many fiery
  meteors were occasioned by the collection and inflammation af
 terwards by electricity of hydrogen in the upper regions of the
 atmosphere.        This induced me to make the following experi
 ment.       I made a mixture of two parts of hydrogen and one of
 oxygen by measure. With this I filled a jar eighteen inches long
 and nearly three inches in diameter. This mixture, after having
 stood in dry quicksilver for nine months, was found to be uni
 form throughout the whole column ; for when a small portion of
 the lower part was transferred with little or no agitation, it was
 wholly condensed into water by the electric spark.
     The rotundity of a bubble of air, whether simple or mixed,
 shows a strong influence of its atoms or particles on each other :
 and probably this influence, as I originally supposed, is occasioned
 by the gravitation of their solid particles towards each other,
 particularly as those particles must be in proportion to their dia
 meters removed a considerable distance from each other.
     It is remarkable that Mr. Dalton should enumerate the slightest
 and the most trifling observations of different authors who wrote
 after me on this subject, and pass over the facts above quoted
which must be allowed to be original.         He cannot plead as an
excuse that he had not read my Comparative View, after what
 has lately occurred  No, the omission is evidently wilful.         I
 could expect nothing else.                                , ,
     It is said that there is a species of depravity peculiar to hu
man nature  which     is,   that we hate the person we injure more
than any other individual.        This
                                    is   readily accounted for.
     The rest of this paper relates to the different chemical com
binations with azote and oxygen according to the different pro
               which they unite.     He gives the opinion and experi
         a in
portions
ments of        great many chemists, who have attempted to prove
the quantity of azote and oxygen     by    weight and measure in the
different compounds which those elements are capable of forming.
                                                                 No

     on the   Chemical Compounds         of Azote  and Oxygen,      &c. 245
No two of them agree, and he differs a Utile from them all : but
he takes care to adhere to the middle line of difference ; for any
person intimately acquainted with experimental chemistry will
readily perceive, in reading his New System of Philosophy, that
he is not an experimenter, notwithstanding             what he asserts on
that subject : in short, whatever knowledge he possesses is evi
dently derived from reading the experiments and the writings of
others.
    I will therefore pass over this contradictory detail, particularly
as it is almost in substance what Dr. Thomson advanced in his
History of the Atomic Theory in the Encyclopcedia Brkannica,oi
which I have already taken notice in this Magazine for November
and December 1816.
    The only part of it that deserves any attention is what relates
to the doctrine of definite proportions, which Mr. Dallon at
tempts to explain in his own way; but no mention is made of its
original author.         On this part he begins thus:      " The subject of
the greatest difference amongst us is in regard to the absolute
weights of the elements azote and oxygen, which combine to
form the several compounds.            Gay Lussac and most of the other
chemists I have mentioned, who follow him as volumists*, con
tend that the proportions are as under: viz.
             Measures.         Measures.               Measures.
           100 azote       +   50 oxygen      = 100 nitrous oxide.
           100   ...   .   +  100 . . . .     =200 nitrous gas.
           100   ....      +150    .. ..      =        subnitrous acid.
           100....         +200    .. ..      = 100 nitrous acid gas.
           100 ....        +250    .. ..      =        nitric acid.
    The foregoing proportions      are pretty correct, as shall be shown
presently.
    " But    (continues Mr. Dalton) from the views I entertain on
the subject as derived from experiments, the true portions of
   * My Comparative View was published twenty years before Mr. Dalton's
Neio System, of Philosophy appeared, and Gay Lussac had written some
time after hjin. It will be found by any person who will take the pains of
carefully perusing my work, that I was perfectly acquainted with the pro
portions in which gases combine in volumes ; it was the ground-work, to
gether with their specific gravities, on which my entire system rested: and
without this knowledge no human being could attempt to estimate the dif
 ferent proportions in which they unite particle to particle ; and much less
 the relative size, and of course the relative weight, of those particles; for
 the specific weight of the ultimate divisions of all kinds of ponderable
 matter is the same their size or diameter only constitutes the difference.
    Without a previous knowledge of the foregoing principles, we might as
 well attempt to ascertain the weight of the most distant fixed stars, as those
 of particles, atoms, or molecules of matter: hence it is evident that the
above passage of his operates more against Mr, Dalton than any thing that
 could be brought forward.
                                  Q3                                         the

246                Remarks on a Paper by        Mr. Dalton
  the compounds would be more nearly stated as under."              Then
  his table of measures of the proportions in which the two gases
  unite, and symbols to represent their atoms, are given.          I shall
  content myself at present by describing those proportions of
  atoms and measures, beginning with the nitrous oxide, as con
  taining the smallest proportion of oxygen.
      Mr. Dalton, wishing to differ from every body else, states that
  100 of azote and 60 measures of oxygen enter into the constitu
 tion of nitrous oxide ; and he represents the compound atom as
  consisting of two ultimate particles of azote and one ultimate
 particle of oxygen.       Now it has been shown by Sir H. Davy and
 by myself,   in a  variety of ways, a good many years ago, that this
 gas   consists of one  volume of azote and half a volume of oxygen ;
 and as each particle of the azotic gas was supplied with a parti
 cle of oxygen, I inferred that the half volume of oxygen con
 tained as many divisions as one volume of azote, on the same
 principle that one volume of oxygen contains the same number
 of divisions that the two volumes of hydrogen do. I also in
 ferred that the ultimate particles of azote are nearly twice the
 size and of course twice the weight of those of oxygen, although
 the latter gas is somewhat heavier. The specific gravity of
 gases, as I have long since proved in my Comparative View, does
 not always indicate the real weight of their ultimate particles or
 atoms ; and this circumstance has led chemists into many blun
 ders, particularly those who have attempted to ascertain the
 weight of atoms and molecules on the principle of my definite
  proportions.
     But to return to the       gaseous oxide.  It would require 200
 measures of azote in the       place of 100, to supply the atoms of
 this gas with two ultimate     particles of azote; and the ten measures
 of oxygen which he has        thrown in, by way of showing the ac
 curacy of his philosophy, are quite superfluous.
     I consider azote, like almost all substances that unite to oxy
gen, as an inflammable base; and an ultimate particle of oxygen
never unites to two ultimate particles of any inflammable base ;
while the reverse is the constant law of nature, as I particularly
demonstrated throughout the whole of my Comparative View,
and I have laid great stress lately on the importance of this law
in my Atomic Theory and Electrical Phcenomena.
    Next in regular order comes nitrous gas. He allows this gas
 100 of azote and 124 of oxygen by measure, and its atom is re
presented as one of azote and one of oxygen.            1 00 measures of
oxygen would give every ultimate particle, in 100 of azote two
ultimate particles, so as to form an atom of nitrous gas ; there
fore, according to Mr. Dalton's atom, 74 measures of oxygen
remain unaccounted for.
                                                               Agreeably

     on the Chemical Compounds          of Azote      and Oxygen,       &c.   £47
      Agreeably to my experience, nitrous gas consists of one mea
 sure of azote and one of oxygen, and the latter affords two par
  ticles to every one of the former so as to constitute an atom.
      When nitrous gas and nitrous oxide are mixed, they only dif
 fuse through each other mechanically; for the nitrous gas retains
  its second particle of oxygen with as great force as the other
  gas can attract it  therefore no change can be produced. None
 of those gases possess an acid property.
      The third compound of those elements is called subnitrous
 acid: it is what I distinguished in my Comparative View by the
 name red nitrous acid, from its red colour.            This acid according
 to Mr. Dalton consists of 100 of azote and 186 of oxygen by
 measure, and the atom is represented by his diagram or symbol
 as consisting of three ultimate particles of oxygen and two of
 azote.     Let us examine those proportions :  In the first place,
  150 measures of oxygen would supply every particle in 100 of
 azote with three particles of oxygen ; there remains therefore a
 surplus of 36 measures of oxygen.            As to the second particle of
 azote, I cannot conceive whence it came or how supplied, unless
 indeed the atoms were cloven in two.
      This acid, according to my experiments, contains one mea
sure and a half of oxygen and one of azote ; and the atom, as re
presented in my Comparative View, consists of one particle of
 azote and three of oxygen.           It is difficult to obtain this a acid
pure ; that      is,free from the pale or straw-coloured nitrous acid
which will be described presently.          It   is  obtained in tolerable
                                                                    a
degree of purity when nitrous gas          is   mixed    in excess with at
mospheric      air,   or when    nitrous   gas  is  passed into nitric acid
until  it    incapable
            is            of  receiving any more.       This acid can exist
in the gaseous state when excluded from water.            :
     The next and fourth compound          is   distinguished      by
                                                                   the name
of nitrous acid gas     by   some modern chemists.        I  called.it in mv
 Comparative View, pale or straw-coloured nitrous acid, from its
colour.     Mr. Dalton supposes this acid to consist of 100 of
azote and 248 of oxygen        by    measure.      The 200 alone, laving
aside the 48 measures of oxygen, would supply every particle of
the azote with four particles of oxygen and yet, to my very great
                                            ;
surprise, Mr.Dalton's symbol represents the atom of this aeid
as consisting of one particle of azote and two of oxygen, the
proportions which the atom of nitrous gas contains.
     In my Comparative View represented the atom of this acid,
                                I
by   means of diagram, as consisting of one particle of azote and
                 a
four of oxygen.                     :
  It   is very difficult to obtain this acid pure; for         the common
                                                              in
way of distillation    it comes over with more or less of red nitrous
acid, or with    a  mixture of nitric acid. This acid          produced
                                                              is              by
                                Q   4                                    mixing

248             Remarks on a Paper     ly Mr. Dalian
mixing two measures of nitrous gas with one of oxygen.        This
shows that the one measure of oxygen contains twice as many
particles as there are atoms in two measures of nitrous gas. This
was one of the many facts which led me originally to the doc
trine of definite proportions that beautiful law by which oxygen
unites to bodies in different doses, and that the 2d, 3d, 4th, and
5th were all distinct multiples of the first or minimum dose.
    In producing the pale, nitrous acid by mixing oxygen and
nitrous gas, there are sometimes formed atoms of the red nitrous
acid mixed with the pale, therefore less oxygen is consumed j
and again, particles of nitric acid are formed, which demand
more oxygen, and which only mix with the pale ;  in these cases
 different quantities of oxygen are consumed by the nitrous gas.
 The foregoing variations depend upon the manner in which the
 gases are mixed, and the surface which they present to water.
     These facts will account for the difference of opinion enter
 tained by chemists respecting the proportions in which the two
 gases unite so as to form, according to them, the same acid.
     The fifth and last combination of those elements is the nitric,
 which I called in my Comparative View the colourless nitrous
 acid, as being when perfectly pure as limpid as distilled water.
     Mr. Dalton represents this as composed of 100 measures of
 azote and 310 of oxygen: this quantity should give more than
 six ultimate particles of oxygen to each particle of the azote.
 His symbol gives only five, with the extraordinary proportion of
 two of azote :  whence comes the second particle of azote is best
 known to Mr. Dalton himself ; I cannot make it out, I must
  own.
     In my Comparative View I represented the atoms of this acid
 as consisting  of one particle of azote and five of oxygen. My
 definite proportions of the different compounds which those
 elements are capable of forming, are as follow :
                 Nitrous oxide     . .    . .     1 and 1 .
                 Nitrous gas       .,             1 and 2.

                 Nitric acid       ..     .. 1 and 5.
     The variation of the different forces of attraction according
 to the quantum of oxygen was also stated, which is the most im
 portant part of the whole system, and which alone could enable
 me to account for the following facts ; viz,
              1 and 1 will have no effect on        1 and 2.
              1 and 2 will not affect         . .    ) and 3.

 They will only mix mechanically.
                                                                  On

     on the Chemical Compounds     of Azote and Oxygen,&c.       249
     Oil the other hand, in the following order they will have a
chemical action on each other, so as to produce a partial de
composition.
     1 and 2 will take one portion of its oxygen from I and 4, and
               1 and 3 will be produced between them both.
.  ; 1 and 3 will also deprive 1 and 5 of one portion    of its oxv-
               gen, and 1 and 4 will be the result.
     The foregoing facts are founded on experiments, and they
prove that my proportions are indisputably correct.
     I will here make one remark on Mr. Dalton's symbols ; that
>s, he unites my 1 and 1 to my 1 and 2 to form an atom of red
nitrous acid, and my 1 and 2 with 1 and 3 to form an atom of
nitric acid. Now these atoms are incapable of uniting che
 mically, as I stated above.
     Considering that those distinctions of the definite proportions
in .which azote and oxygen unite to form the foregoing different
compounds originated with me, as had been often stated, and
which facts and dates render as clear as possible, it is really ex
traordinary that Mr. Dalton should not even mention my name
in treating on this small part of my system, were I ever so wrong
in my calculation.      But the wonder will cease when it is con
sidered that he brings forward as his own my diagrams, which
represent the proportions in which the particles of the different
elements unite so as to form distinct atoms, in a mutilated and
discordant state in the form of symbols, in order to disguise them
from the original. But what is still worse, in those symbols of
his, monstrous proportions are represented, which Nature never
produced.
     I am inclined to think that Mr.Dalton himself, after what has
passed respecting him and me, and after three or four years si-*
lence on the subject, would never come forward with his old
song so wretchedly set to music,  if such I can call his symbols, 
without making some apology for what has lately passed on the
subject of the atomic theory.       It must be a ruse de guerre of
one of his friends, and I strongly suspect who the person is; but
as Mr. Dalton's name is to the paper, and no doubt with his
consent, he alone should be addressed.        It is very much to be
lamented that science should be infested with such juggling.
     There are at present a certain number of writers on chemistry,
who, to the disgrace of the nineteenth century, make it a common
practice to play into each other's hands, and to deprive men of
superior talents and information of the originality of their dis
coveries ; and should it happen that they cannot take immediate
possession of them, they pass them by unnoticed in their com
pilations until a more favourable opportunity offers. This shame-
                                                                   All

          I
  Sir,  beg to tender my best thanks to Mr. Winch for the
 new facts regarding the interesting Stratification of Northumber
  land, Durham, Yorkshire, and Cumberland, which he has fur
 nished pp. 207 and 208 of your last Number ; being willing and
 anxious to consider these, as preludes to much more numerous
 and precise local facts, in answer to my several Queries in p. 1 22
 &c. ; part of which, Mr. W. might now, perhaps, furnish from
 his Notes, or will ere long, from inquiry or inspection of the
 spots, be able, it is hoped, to furnish, and which I will still rely
 on his kindness to do, and hasten to return the best answers in
 my power, to his two queries in p. 208.
     1st. I certainly consider, as I have understood Mr. Smith,
 Mr.Farey (P. M. xxxix. p. 256, and xliii. p. 256 &c.) and many
 others to do, the Alum-shale series and irregularly thin Coal-
 series on    it,
                in the north-east of Yorkshire, to be included in
 the assemllage of Strata, of an argillaceous characterprincipally,
 which Mr. Smith, its discoverer, found     convenient, and without

     I will  however add, that in most instances, as has been done
about     Lyth*, those who have with effect studied the Smithian
principles of Mineral Surveying, will be at no loss to subdivide
Mr. Smith's " chmch clay," into several Strata, and distinctly
show their continuous ranges on a Map of sufficient scale, with
Sections in any direction, &c.; and by means chiefly of the fossil
Shells species, rather than by the precise Mineral species (by
which " formations" are usually and solely attempted to be iden
tified) to identify the same (as Mr. Smith has done) in situations
too distant, or which are too much intersected by faults, or by
alluvial or unconformably overlieing Marl patches, for each stra
tum to be actually traced in connection on the surface.                See
my paper       on Fossil  Shells,  vol. xlv. p. 274.
     2d. I have never visited Thirkelbv, or made any observations
myself, in the small Coal-field to the E and SE of Thirsk ; but
from various notes of the inquiries I have made concerning the
strata of the vicinity of Thirkelby, I can entertain few doubts,
of the blue shelly Limestone of that place, being one of several
thin Rocks of shelly Limestone f, which lie between the upper

 I have seen these Limestones, at the SE corner of Staith's Bay
NW of Whitby, from the top of the cliffs over Boulby Tunnel,
on the W of Staithsbeck Fulling-mill, at Blue-Bank, and in other
cliffs by the Esk River, and I can entertain no doubt that I
should be able to trace these, wherever alluvia or unconformable
 Red Marl is absent or deranging faults do not intervene, in a con
 tinued course, to the vicinity of Thirkelby, and thence forward,
into and across the eastern part of Lincolnshire.
      I heartily wish that Mr. Buckland or Mr. Fryer, the latter
 Gentleman in particular, because he is locally resident, and has
at this time the whole of Northumberland and Cumberland un
 der his Survey, for publishing improved Maps of these Counties,
 would carefully, and without reference to any Theories, consider
 my five heads of queries in your February number, and those
 which now follow in continuation, and communicate through
 your pages, all the precise facts they can, which have reference
  to them.

Tindal-fall dip? : what is the series sunk through in their Pits? ;
are there in the vicinity either eastward or westward, any consi
derable masses or strata of Basalt in any of its varieties (not
Dykes) ? ; and if so, where are they situated precisely ? ; In
what direction do they dip and take-cover ? ; and what are the

   An intelligent Gentleman, who has all his life resided in the
elevated country south of Jedburgh, and who, though no pro
fessed Mineralogist, is well acquainted locally, with all "the tract
due west and north-west of the Cheviots," happening to call on
me a few days ago, and to whom I showed Mr. Winch's Map
and description of the Cheviots, in the Geological Transactions,
professed his ignorance of any coarse slaty Rocks (like those
about Hawick and Selkirk which he knows well) in the vale of the
Beaumont, or on Carterfell; although there are (he says) some
patches, or a narrow range of such coarse slaty Rocks, along the
south-eastern verge of Cheviot, although far less extensive, he
believes, than the " Grauwakke slate
                                        " district, coloured there
in Mr.W's Map, who has written Carter-fell in the same, instead
of its true position, to the SW, facing the head of Reed Dale :
 and certainly this Scotch Gentleman said, the coarse slaty Rocks,
 here, do not join on the surface, or near           to those like them

    7th. Can the very lower part of the Coal, Sandstone, Shale
 and Limestone series, sometimes called       byMr.Winch the " Lead-
 mine Measures," which he represents as surrounding and lap
 ping on the north, the east, and the southern flanks of the Che
 viot mass, be in like manner traced continuously, on its western
 side, from Kerryburn to Mindrum        ?   If  so,      by
                                                          what route, ex
 actly?;   and what  are  the dips, at several points,   in this range  ?.

 northern parts of England are composed, and for such he will ever
 feel obliged.    He will now however, not let slip the opportunity
 of remarking, that after examining carefully, many score miles
 of the ranges of Basaltic masses, he has uniformly found them,
 us distinctly stratified and interlaid between regular strata, as
 most of the latter are, with regard to one another            :   not one
 anomaly as to Basaltic strata appearing, except in degree, from
 what  is  very common with other strata,

    Every competeitt Mineral Surveyor, or Person among those who
properly consult practical Sinkers, Soughers, Quarriers, &c, and
who collect, consult and contrast Specimens from the British
Strata, (I pretend not to speak of countries where Mineral Sur
veying is unknown or unapplied) must at this day be acquainted
with the facts, that all the strata, without exception, though in
different degrees, are liable, if I may so express myself, to consi
derable variations in their thicknesses, as well as in the precise
mineral species of which their masses are composed, in different
parts of their course or their dip.       The same stratum, often
swelling   into  Bumps,  or more   commonly Ridges, and changing
almost completely, but more or less suddenly, many of their ex
ternal and even their chemical characters, yet frequently re
turning to all these again, or most of them, as we proceed in
tracing their courses. That between the thicker and more per
fect parts of very numerous strata, they are sometimes found so
Very thin and altered, as to be with considerable difficulty re
cognised ; and yet, has each Stratum, a pretty well marked place
in the Series, of successively deposited strata; such successive
strata eras, being marked, by the existence and extinction, of a
series of Organized Beings: many of these places in the series,
are now well ascertained and known, and by the zealous co
operation of such Men as Mr. Winch, in freely and promptly
communicating in the pages of the Phil. Mag. a vast many more
 may speedily be settled, and the Geological knowledge of Britain
 proportionally advanced.
    And with regard to Dykes or Stone Veins, there really ap
 pear to me, less anomalies with regard to Basalt, from Sand
 stone, Clay, and other mineral masses, all which     Jill Dykes in
 vast numbers, as all Colliers know, than with regard to strata
of these substances, respectively.        Without attempting the
 task, at present an impossible one, of assigning the source or
 origin of Mineral Matter, generally, whether composing strata
 or filling fissures, subsequently opened in strata previously con
 solidated, both seeming equally beyond our comprehension ;
 it seems to me perfectly plain, from a very extensive series of
 observations, that fissures Were originally opened, some in nearly
 equal degrees, so as to produce almost flat and parallel cheeks
 or separated edges of the strata, and others of these cheeks were
 slightly, and some very suddenly concave, consistently with ge
 neral or local causes of shrinking or contracting in the mass ;
 the former of these fissures, the almost parallel sided ones, com
 monly intersecting each other (as the doubly wedging or lenti
 cular ones sometimes do not), and rarely crossing, but more
 commonly ending in each other, so as to separate the mass of
                                                                 the

 thie Earth's crust into very numerous piles of strata, almost or
 entirely separated from each other, by these original fissures: the
 greater part of which, originally open fissures, have, since, been'
 symmetrically filled up, by layers or ribs of mineral matters (of
 very numerous kinds in different cases) applied successively
 against the skirts, until the fissure was filled ; producing thus,
 almost universally, the appearances of nearly vertical newer strata
 or ribs*, intersecting and dividing the original strata, almost per
 pendicular to their planes ; some of which ribs, are nearly pa
 rallel to each other, and others curved, and forming often, very
 suddenly, lenticular masses, in the fissures which had previously
 been open.       I have in no instance been able to discover clear
 marks, of mechanical violence having dislocated the piles of
 strata, previous to the filling up of the Dykes and veins : but since
 that well marked period in the history of ourStrata, a tremendous
 external force seems to have operated, to fracture the Earth
 anew, and dislocate its fragments; such new and dislocating
 fractures (usually now termed faults) having passed along the
 former fissures, in most, but not every instance, the solid dyke-
 stuff or vein-stuff, usually forming now one side of these second
 or fault fissures ; and such dyke-stuff exhibiting the same marks of
 violent grinding, as the aojacent edges of the fractured strata do.
 Into these second and dislocating fissures it        that all the ex--
                                                      is,
traneous matters, like real rolled pebbles (not nodules formed
in the veins), organic remains, &c, have found their way from
 the surface, both into Mineral Veins, and into Faults. The                  al
most general fact, of the faults proving water-tight, and sepa
rating the strata, into distinct plots or drainages, arises mostly,
I  think, from the perfect continuity of the previous vein or Dyke-
stuff and its remaining entire on one side (and         some rare in
                                                            in
stances on both sides) of the Fault, and not from the violent
jamming in of soft clayey matters, into the fault yet in many:
instances, where     a mere crack or very thin fault-sjtuff    visible,is
and yet proves water-tight,      itwould seem, that some such ope
ration has taken place, as with the Sinker, who has occasion to
blast in  a   porous rock, full of water, and has recourse to the ex
pedient,    of cramming his hole quite full of very stiffly-tempered
clay,   and   then very forcibly hammering the same in,         means   by
   *I  do not mean by this to be understood to assert, that any considera
ble portion of all the vertical stiatu, or those very highly inclined, which,
are met with, occupy Dykes: because in general, such are occasioned by
the strata having been applied on the inclining or almost vertical slope of
a bump or ridge in a previously deposited stratum.    For    it   is   by
                                                                    no means
necessary or true, that all strata, even the most shelly or conglomerate,
must have been deposited in an horizontal position; as short-sighted theory
has asserted.

 of the stone are       so closely plugged up, that when the Clay is
 again bored out, the hole will remain free of water, for receiving
 the charge of gunpowder in a proper cartridge.
      But I have been unintentionally led into a long digression,
 which I hope Mr. Winch's goodness will excuse and permit me
 to return, and mention, that 1 conceive we should not " naturally
 consider," that basaltic eminences are anything else but the
 thicker parts of a continuous stratum of Basalt, either actually
 connected together by thinner parts in the lower grounds to
 wards the dip of the strata of the district, or are detached hum
 mocks, beyond the continuous edge of such a stratum, subject
 to the anomalies common (in kind at least) of all other strata:
 and to assure him, that 1 have never yet met with any single
 instance to the contrary : and with regard to Dykes I beg to
 ask,
      8th. Have the Wallbottle and Coleyhill Dykes wedged out, as
 practical Men sometimes say, or have their cheeks met, and the
fissures they occupied ceased, before reaching Montagu Main or
 East Denton Collieries ? ; or, does a cross fault or Dyke range
 between the places mentioned, at which these Dykes terminate,
 respectively, by joining into such cross fault ?.
     I perfectly join with Mr. Winch in concluding this head, that
 in treating not on Basalt only, but on every " peculiar species
of rock, one should be contented to speak of it only in situ:"
but this of course must not justify speaking or writing negatively,
 in the closet, before having examined every part of the surface,
 against inferences from the facts of other districts.
     I beg respectfully to press again my 3d request, for more pre
cise localities of Muscle-shell Ironstone : I cannot admit, that
it is at all impossible to ascertain, to which of the particular
measures, in the numerous sinking accounts with which Mr. W.
has enriched the subject, the muscle-shells belong.         The most
illiterate   Sinker or   Sougher, whom     I ever meet  with, among
some scores, on being shown a lump of the muscle-band, could
almost instantly say, whether he had or had not sunk through a
measure or bed thereof, in any particular Pit, of his recent sinking,
and so of a Sough or Level, and if such Shells were found on. his
hillock, could always say, whence, precisely, they had been dug:
and the comparison of various such independent accounts, might
effectually guard against mistakes or imposition.
     I shall continue anxious to read Mr. W's matured conclusions,
as to the passing of Red Marl (or its Sandstone) under the Alum-
shale, or otherwise, and hope nothing will occur to prevent the
completion of his Yorkshire observations, and their speedy pub
lication afterwards.

so that  we  may  thus estimate    that depth       the degree of corby
responding irregularity   in the length  of  the pendulum.          very                   It   is
important, therefore, to give to the observations of this length
such a precision as may assure us, that the anomalies observed
are not owing to error.      Already    great number of experiments
                                                        a

conformity with the theory of gravity, evidently indicates in the
terrestrial strata, a harmony which they could only have acquired
in a state of primitive fluidity, a state which heat only could
have given to the whole earth.
    The difficulties which present themselves in the measurement
of the pendulum disappear, for the most part, when the same
pendulum is transported to different points of the terrestrial
surface.     It may he said, indeed, that we thus obtain only the
relative lengths of the seconds pendulum in these different places;
but it is sufficient, in order to determine the absolute lengths, to
measure its length with care in one of these places.
    Of all the measures of absolute length, that which we owe to
Borda appears to me to be the most exact. The little difference
which the result .of twenty observations offers, leaves no doubt
of the exactness of their mean result. By applying to them my
formula of probability, I found that an error of a hundredth of a
millimetre would be an extreme improbability, if we were cer
tain that there existed no constant causes of error.
    In examining with attention the ingenious apparatus of Borda,
a circumstance may be noticed, the effect of which, although
very slight, is not to be overlooked in so delicate an inquiry.
The pendulum is suspended from a knife, the edge of which rests
on a horizontal plane.       It has been supposed, in calculation,
that the edge of this knife around which the instrument oscil
lates, is of infinite fineness ; hut on examining it with a micro
scope it presents the form of ademi-cylinder, the radius of which
exceeds a hundredth of a millimetre.        One might at first be led
 to believe that it would be necessary to add this radius to the
 length of the pendulum ; but on reflection it may easily be per
ceived that this addition would be erroneous.         The oscillation
 takes place every instant around the point of contact of the cy
linder with the plane, and this point varies incessantly; it is only
necessary therefore to make a calculation of the force which the
 pendulum experiences from the action of the weight, and from
the friction of the knife upon the plane, in order to know the
correction due to the radius of the cylinder or edge of the knife.
 In making this calculation, on the supposition that the knife
does not slide upon the plane, I ctune to this singular result; that
in place of adding the radius of the cylinder to the length of the
 pendulum, it is necessary to subtract it.     This correction is les3
 sensible, on the length of the pendulum, the longer the oscilla
tions of the pendulum are.         In the experiments of Borda it is
reduced to a fourth of the radius of the cylinder, while it exceeds
that radius in those of Messrs. Bouvard, Biot, antf Mathieu, who
for this reason must have found, and did actually find, a length

than that of Borda.      It is remarkable that in applying the pre--1
ceding correction to the results' of two measurements, their dif
ference should be reduced to less than a half a hundredth of a mil
limetre ; a fact which proves at once the accuracy of the experi
ments' made, and precision of the apparatus invented, by Borda,
a precision which it would be very difficult to surpass.
    If the edge of the knife were to slip upon the plane which
supports    it,the correction would depend on the law of resistance
 of friction, and     would become almost impossible to determine

 better also not to suffer the oscillation to be so strong as that

    The previous remarks on the measure of the seconds pendu
lum   by Borda, have led me to examine particularly the different
circumstances which may have an influence on this class of ex
periments, and the precautions to be taken to ensure the utmost
exactitude of result  precautions which ought to be extreme,
when  it   issought to determine the length of the pendulum to a
hundredth nearly of millimetre.a            The most important of these
consists  in fixing   the  instrument  in  as solid   manner as possible,

the particles of which arc not themselves susceptible of extended
vibrations.    Daniel Bernoulli reported, in the Memoirs of Peters
burg for the year 1777, an observation of Ferdinand B.erthoud,
who, having fixed an excellent astronomical pendulum very
 firmly, which before was rather loosely fixed, found that               this    by
 change alone          lost five minutes in one day
                      it                                        fact  which

Bernoulli explains            very ingenious and sound manner.

veral time-pieces fixed upon the same bar impress                     with  it         a
slight motion, which causes their particles to vibrate, and               the    by
co-operation     of  these   causes  the  time-pieces   act  one   upon   the
other, and reciprocally modifv their oscillations.              Huygens in
his work     De   Horologio Qscitlaloria reports,        that  having thus
fixed two time-pieces which went exactly alike, he saw them
with surprise oscillate quite differently          the oscillations of the
                                                           ;
 one always commencing at the same instant when the oscil
lations of the other terminated.               still more remarkable that
                                              It  is
 this should be the case even when there exists a slight difference
 in the going of two time-pieces placed apart from each other.
 Ellicot has made upon this subject some curious experiments,
 which he has recorded            the Philosophical Transactions of the
                                       in
 year 1741      and M. Breguet has obtained similar results from
                ;

two chronometers placed very near each other.      Many very cu
rious effects of these vibrations have been observed by philoso
phers ; and among these may be particularly distinguished the
phenomena observed by M. Chladni upon sonorous plates and
rods; from which this learned physician has deduced an ingenious
method of determining the swiftness of sound in different solid
bodies.     The preceding researches have led me to the following
theorem, to determine that swiftness in solid, in liquid, and in
aeriform substances.
    I assume that it has been determined by experiment, what de
gree of elongation a solid body placed horizontally, and fixed at
one of its extremities, receives from the action of a weight equal
to its own placed on its other extremity.          If the substance is
fluid, I suppose that it has been determined what is the abbrevia
tion of a horizontal column of this fluid of the length of a metre
and compressed by a weight equal to its own.          This settled : if
we divide by this degree of elongation or abbreviation double the
weight which will depress the bodies in a second sexagesimal,
the square root of this quotient will be the number of metres
which sound traverses in that substance during the same in-,
 terval.
    Thus Borda having observed that a brass rod of eleven feet
and a half in length, and 37 ounces in weight, was lengthened
by the action of a weight of twenty-four pounds five parts and
three-fourths, each part being a hundred-thousandth          of a fa
thom; it follows that a rod of one metre will be lengthened
0m,000, 000,7737 9 by the action of a weight equal to its own.
Dividing by that fraction the space 9m,80SS, the double of what
the weight draws at Paris, in the first second, the square root
3560-4 of the quotient will be the number of metres which sound
traverses during one second in brass,                              ,
    It is known that the swiftness of sound in the air is increased
about one-sixth by the heat which develops the approximation
 of the vibrating particles. The same cause must without doubt
 alter that swiftness in ail bodies, but it is difficult to determine
 the exact influence of it.   We may, however, approach near to
 such a determination, by comparing the swiftness deduced from
 the preceding theorem, with that resulting from the method
 of M. Chladni; for that method founded upon the sound pro
 duced by the longitudinal vibratiohs of sonorous rods, giving the
 real velocity of sound, the excess of that velocity above the
 preceding will be the effect of the temperature alternately ele^
 vated and reduced in the vibrations.      The swiftness of sound,
 according to the experiments of Chladni upon a brass rod, is
3596mc-58 per second ; which only surpasses the preceding in
about a hundredth part.      The influence of the caust; alluded to

 260          On the Velocities   of Sound in different  Bodies.
 is then much less here than in air; but the slight errors of ex
  periments leave this subject still in some incertitude.
     In order to apply this result to fluids. 1 shall tak* water as the
  example.      According to the experiments of Canton, recorded in
  the fifty-second and fifty- fourth volumesof the Philosophical Trans
  actions, when the heat of the barometer is 0m,76, the centigrade
  thermometer marking 10% the pressure of the atmosphere dimi
  nishes the volume of water 42'5 millionths : the linear diminu
  tion is three times less. Thus a column of water of a metre hi
  length is diminished 14*5 millionths by a pressure equal to that
  of a vertical column of the same fluid of the height of 10mc,325.
  The reduction of the first column compressed bv a weight equal
  to its own is then 0rae,000001,4044.        By dividing 9me,8088 by
  that fraction 2642,8, the square root of the quotient will be the
  number of metres which sound traverses in water during one
 second ;  its swiftness in this fluid is then nearly eight times
  greater than in air.
     The experiments of Canton upon sea-water, the specific weight
 of which is 1,028, give 37,5 millionths as the diminution of its
 volume by the pressure of the atmosphere ; whence it follows
 that sound must traverse salt-water 2807m,4 in a second.        These
 two proportions taken relatively to a temperature of ten degrees
 vary very sensibly with it.
     Experiments to determine the velocity of sound in different
 substances, such as have been made in the preceding instances,
 appear to me well worthy of engaging the attention of phi
 losophers.
             On the Velocities   of Sound in different Bodies.
     Newton has given in the second book of his Mathematical
 Principles of Natural Philosophy, a theorem of the velocity of
 sound, which is one of the most remarkable traits of his genius.
The velocity deduced from this theorem is about a sixth less
than that which results from experiments made with great care
in 1738 bv the members of this Academy (French Academy).
Newton, who had already discerned that difference from the ex
periments made in his time, has endeavoured to explain it ; but
the modern discoveries on the nature of atmospheric air have
destroyed that explanation, as well as every other which geome
tricians have subsequently proposed.         These discoveries fortu
nately present    us with   a   phenomenon which appears to be the
true cause of the excess of swiftness observed in sound, above
the degree of swiftness calculated, and which the greater part of
philosophical geometricians have since adopted.           This pheno
menon consists in the heat which the air develops by its com
pression.     When its temperature is raised, its pressure remaining

            On the Velocities of Sound in    different Bodies.    261
the same, a part only of the caloric which it receives is employed
to produce that effect. The other part which remains latent
serves to dilate its volume ; and it is this which develops itself
when the air thus dilated is reduced by compression to its original
yolume.      The heat disengaged by the approximation of two
neighbouring particles of an aerial vibrating fibre, increases their
temperature, and spreads itself gradually over the air and sur
rounding bodies : but this diffusion and irradiation taking place
with an extreme slowness relatively to the swiftness of the vibra
tions, it may be reasonably supposed that during the period of a
vibration the quantity of heat remains the same between two
adjoining particles.     Thus these particles in approximating re
pel    each  other more  at first, because, their temperature being
supposed constant, their mutual repulsion augments in an inverse
ratio to their distance ; and afterwards, because the latent ca
loric which develops itself raises their temperature.          Newton
had only regarded the first of these two causes of repulsion ; but
it is evident that the second cause ought to increase the swift
ness of sound, since it augments the elasticity of the air.        By
taking this into the calculation, I arrive at the following theorem :
    " The real swiftness of sound is equalized to the product of
swiftness which the Newtonian formula gives by the square root
of the affinity of the specific heat of air submitted to the con
stant pressure of the atmosphere and to different temperatures,
to its specific heat when its volume remains constant."
     If we suppose, with many philosophers, that the heat con
tained in a mass of air submitted to a constant pressure and to
 different temperatures is proportional to its volume (which would
 be deviating a little from the truth), the preceding square root
will become that of the affinity of the difference of two pressures
 to the difference of the quantities of heat which two equal volumes
 of atmospheric air submitted respectively to these pressures' de
 velops, in passing from a given temperature to an inferior tem
 perature ; the smallest of these quantities of heat and the smallest
 of these pressures being taken for unities.
     Being desirous of comparing this theorem with experience, 1
 have fortunately found the data of the observation which it sup-¦
 poses among the numerous results of the interesting work of
 M.M. La Roche and Berard upon the specific heat of gas. These
 able philosophers have calculated the quantities of heat which
 two equal bodies of atmospheric air emit by a reduction in tem
 perature of about eighty degrees ;  the one compressed by the
 weight of the atmosphere, the other by the same weight aug
 mented            They have found that the heat disengaged, rela
 tive to the greatest pressure, was 1-24; the heat relative to the
  smallest pressure being unity.     It is necessary then according to
                                      R3                           the

262          On the Principles    of Beauty in Colouring:
the preceding theorem, in order to obtain the real swiftness of
sound, to multiply the swiftness deduced from the formula of
Newton by the square root of the affinity of            to      or by
 the root of -5-. To the temperature of six degrees, this formula
gives 282-42 for the space which sound ought to traverse in a
second : multiplying that by V f- , that space ought to be equal
to 345-3Ti.      The observation of the French academicians makes
it only 337' 18. The difference of these two results may be
 owing to the inaccuracy of the experiments ; but the smallness
of that difference establishes in an incontestable manner, that
the excess of the swiftness observed above the swiftness calcu
lated by the Newtonian formula, is owing to the latent heat which
 the compression of the air develops.
    It results from what has been stated that, supposing the pres
 sure constant, if we augment a given volume of air by elevating
 its temperature, and afterwards reduce it by compression to its
original volume, it will disengage by that compression a third
 of the heat employed.         It is to be desired that philosophers
would determine by direct experiments the affinity of specific
heats of the air to constant pressure, and of the air to a constant
 volume:  this affinity we have found equal to 1-5.       The swift
 ness of sound observed by the French academicians gives 1-4254
for this affinity; and perhaps, considering the difficulty of di
 rect experiments, this swiftness is the most precise means of
 obtaining it.
    I have in the second part of these observations reckoned the
swiftness of sound in rain-water and in sea-water equal to
 2642-S and 2807'4 per second, by dividing the experiments of
Canton upon the compression of these liquids, and having only
regard to the linear diminution of the dimensions of the com*
pressed volume.       I have since found that it is necessary to con
sider the total diminution of this volume, and that the preceding
numbers ought thus to be divided by */ 3, which reduces them
to 152v8 and 1620-9; so that the swiftness of sound in fresh
water is four degrees and a half greater than in air.
    LXV.    On the Principles    of Beauty in Colouring.    By Mr.
                            T. Tredgold*.
If the term beautiful       be restricted to those objects only which
give pleasure from the pleasing associations they recaH to the
beholder, then the investigation of any other causes, which may
contribute towards rendering objects beautiful, would be an use
less labour ; for this limited definition of beauty precludes all
inquiry, and is as unsatisfactory as it is unphilosophical.        On

-the contrary,  if beauty be a term for that quality of objects which
renders them capable of exciting an emotion of pleasure, the cause
of that emotion becomes an interesting object of inquiry.
   The emotion excited by the presence of a beautiful object may
either arise from the peculiar constitution of our organs of sen-
sation, or from the pleasing associations it recalls to the mind :
but, in general, the emotion may be considered as the combined
effect of both these causes.
    In inquiries of this kind we cannot expect to show the cor
rectness of our reasoning by a detail of experiments ; but when
it leads to principles which coincide with or approach to those
followed by artists who have cultivated their natural powers of
perceiving the beautiful, we may justly conclude that it is correct.
Those who have never studied geometry would be very incom
petent judges of the beauty of a geometrical demonstration;  and
is it less inconsistent to expect those who have never examined
the effect of different .combinations of colours, to be capable of
deciding on the comparative beauty of an arrangement of colours ?
Colours, in themselves, perhaps, cannot be cpnsidered as beautiful
when divested of the associations which accompany them ; but a
succession or combination of colours may be beautiful, and that
not from any physical or intrinsic quality in the colours, but from
the peculiar structure of the organ, and the manner in which it
transmits the impressions to the mind.       Instances of such com
binations may be seen in the rainbow, the prismatic spectrum^
coloured rings, fringes*, minerals f, flowers, &c.
    A late writer, who affects to denv that the beauty of colours
depends on particular successions or combinations, admits that
in the case of sounds " there is such an organieal delight ; and
that it constitutes a larger share of the beauty of sounds, than
tints and shadows do of the beauty of visible objects J." And in
another publication, he says, he docs not " mean to dispute, that
there are such things as melody and harmony, and that most
men are offended or gratified by the violation or observance of
those laws upon which they depend.          This, however, it should
be observed, is a faculty quite unique, and unlike any thing else
in our constitution ; by no means universal, as the sense of
beauty   is, even   incultivated societies, and apparently withheld
from whole communities of quick-eared           savages and barba
rians §."
    Now in this there      is something extremely inconsistent     for:
though the mere musical arrangement of sounds may not excite

the emotion    of beauty   ;  yet it will scarcely be said that sounds
 without melody or harmony would excite such emotions;  and
 therefore the beauty of musical compositions must in some mea
 sure depend on the succession and combination of agreeable
 sounds.
    It will be obvious to the reader that I confine the teTm beau
 tiful, to those emotions which are suggested to the mind by means
that are agreeable to the organs of sensation.               This forms the
distinction between the beautiful and sublime; as it does not ap
pear necessary that sounds should be agreeable to produce the
emotion of sublimity.
    I am not aware that the ears of savages and barbarians are
in any respect different from those of other men ; and there are
physical reasons from which we may conclude that they would
be equally sensible of the melody of sound with their more civi
lized brethren, if their natural powers were not vitiated by the
powerful influence of early habits.         As sound is communicated
by the vibration of sonorous bodies, when there is not a certain
relation between the times of vibration of coexistent sounds, it is
obvious that, though the emotion excited may not be absolutely
painful, except to a musical ear, yet we feel dissatisfied with                 it,
habit will make us insensible of the disagreement, and habit will
render the ear sensible of      itto     painful degree. To what can

periment would have furnished him with a practical refutation of
his opinion.
   If we   suppose a piece of canvass to be covered with unmeaning
masses    of light and shade, richly and harmoniously coloured,
and the light and shade distributed by the tasteful hand of a
superior artist ; there cannot be a doubt respecting the beauty
of such a composition : and it is evident that its beauty proceeds
from two causes ; the one arising from association, the other
from sensation. The pleasing effect produced on the eye would
lead us to admire the skill and knowledge displayed by the artist;
and the effect would not be diminished, at least in the eye of a
trained judge, when he found that it was not an imitation of
any particular object.
   What is it that constitutes the beauty of minerals ? There we
have no artist's skill nor power to associate; neither is there any
pleasing indication of spring or summer, as in flowers ;  is it not
to the pleasures of sensation alone that they owe their beauty?
It is true, as Mr. Knight has justly observed, that " the scale of
pleasing and displeasing impressions cannot be graduated ac
cording to- any abstract general rule, but must be adapted to
the different degrees of sensibility of different organs ; which
vary, not only constitutionallv,      but habitually ; the eye, as well
as the palate, being liable to be vitiated, and consequently to
require such stimulants to give it pleasure, as give pain to those
of more refined sensibility*."
   The Russian, who has acquired a taste for train-oil, and the
Dutchman, who paints his house with all the gaudy colours
which he finds in his tulip bedf, no doubt, were born with tastes
and faculties similar to those of other men.
   The power of perceiving the beautiful, like every other natural
power, may be improved and extended by education and a ha
bitual attention to the beautiful in Nature ; and, like our other
faculties, it may be impaired or lost through neglect.
   In the composition of colours, it is not necessary that they
should be in perfect harmony.           A judicious contrast frequently
adds much to the beauty of colouring; and the taste of the artist
cannot be displayed to a greater advantage than in the skilful
management of this mode of heightening the beauty oi his com
positions.
   Mr. Alison, speaking of form,         says
                                                " that it ought to be the
unceasing study of the artist, to disengage his mind from the ac
cidental associations of his age, as well as the common preju-

dices of his art ; to labour to distinguish his productions by that
pure and permanent expression, which may be felt in every age j
and to disdain to borrow a transitory fame by yielding to the
temporary caprices of his time :" for
                                       " the fame of the artist must
altogether depend upon the permanence of the expression which
he can communicate to his work ; and the only expression which
is thus permanent, and which can awaken the admiration of
every succeeding age, is that which arises from the nature of form
itself, and which is founded upon the uniform .constitution of
Man and of Nature*."        Such views should also.be his guide in
colouring : for fashions may vary, and the maimers and habits of
nations may change ; but the principles of colouring will always
be the same ;  they are founded in the " constitution of Man and
of Nature," and may, at any time, be elicited by the unbiassed
powers of reason.

                                  To   Mr. Tillach.
Sir,         At the time     I   drew up in great haste, towards the end
 of last month, a few particulars, which you have done me a great
 favour in so promptly inserting at p. 213 of your last Numberf,
 as to Mr, Liston's novel and grand Organ then exhibiting, I
 was unaware that Professors and Amateurs would so suddenly be
 deprived of the high gratification they were increasingly re
 ceiving, in flocking to try and hear               it,
                                                the necessity which
                                                          by

packing up this Instrument, to send        on board the Castlereagh,

Hot in retired villages only, but in the Metropolis and in Glas
gow, to the use of any Instrumental Music whatever in their
Kirks, we-see the singular example, and laudable spirit displayed
by the members of this same religious community, in a distant
colony, in being the first to order an Euharmonic Organ of any
sort ! : and that on so grand a scale, with compound Stops. While
by the English nation, who affect to consider an Organ, almost
as a necessary appendage to every polite Church or Chapel, Mr.
Liston and his friends have been left to bear the heavy charge
of constructing three successive Organs, exhibiting thein gratis,
and issuing prospectuses, &c. without the public having given to
the really scientific improvement Mr. L. has effected, in the most
delightful of Arts, the least effective patronage whatever ! ; the
sale of his " Essay on perfect Intonation," not having paid its
expense of printing, as the writer understands, who in justice to
himself begs to observe, that he is without the most distant mo
tives in making these remarks, besides those of zeal in the pro
motion of the harmonic science, and to serve ingenious and de
serving Individuals, who have promoted it.
   Since the performances to which 1 alluded in my last com
munication, His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex, the Earls
of Buckingham and Kenton, Lord and Lady Darnley, and several
other persons of distinction, the members of the Philharmonic
Society, and on the whole not less than 500 musical persons
attended the performances on this Organ : in which, among other
pieces
   Mr. Purkis played from the works of Pergolesi, " Gloria in
excelsis :"  from those of Winter, " Vaghi Colli" in Proserpine,
in the Key of Ab, instead of A, as set : and one of his Airs in F
minor:  from Haydn, " On thee, each living Soul awaits:"
                                '
and, " The Heavens are telling," in B 5 sharps, instead of C.
 From Handel, several pieces from the Dettingen " Te Deum ;"
"  Surely he hath borne :"
                               " And with his Stripes :" " All we
like Sheep ;" and,    " For unto us a Child."  And from Mozart,
the Overture to Don Giovanni.
   Mr. Potter also gave his assistance in ably exhibiting the
Euharmonic Organ, viz. from the Works of Haydn, a movement
from The Passion.  from Sebastian Bach, " Tantum Ergo." 
from Mozart,
                 " Qui Sedes:" " Quoniam Tu Solus:" and, " Et

and " Crucifixus etiam."  from Handel, " Lift up your Heads."

      Mr. Alsager exhibited various new and unexpected results,
  of chords truly tuned on this Instrument, such as the marked
  and pleasing character of the IX, very closely associating it with
  the less grateful of the Concords ; and he said that this interval
  could be almost as certainly adjusted by the ear at once in
  tuning, as one of the Concords : the same with regard to the
  *VI : and the bl0,(726) ; the perfectly smooth and agreeable
  effect of the discords XIV and XVI, when heard in the common
  Chord on the Twelfth and Diapason Stops, and others, which it
  might be tedious to mention.
      It having been hinted by some of the Profession, to whom
  Messrs. Flight and Robson had handed the printed Paper copied

  their laudable zeal to explain the principles of the Instrument

  LXVII.      Observations 071 Equation of Payments; tending to prove
      that the generally -received Rule of Malcolm is not correct.
      By   Mr.J.B. Benwell.
                                To Mr. Tilloch.
  Sir,      In   the cessation from other engagements, I send you
  the    following observations    for insertion in the Philosophical
   Magazine.
      It has been asserted, and with evident reason too, by mathe
   matical writers of the present day, that no rule in arithmetic has
  been subject to more dispute than the rule for equating of pay
  ments.      But as in the case of the binomial theorem mathema
  ticians have long been seeking a general demonstration from
  principles too refined and foreign to its object, so in this rule
   called equation of payments, a principle has been assumed which
   (although accurate in itself) will not apply as the basis of a legi
'
   timate datum, excepting by virtue of an express convention pre
   viously and purposely made.
      But it would really seem that the controversy had been effec
  tually decided by the unanimous adoption of Malcolm's rule, as
  simplified since his time, and which may be found in the few
                                                              treatises

270^Observations          on   Equaiion of Payments; tending          to   prove
treaties appertaining to scientific, that we at present possess on
the subject.  That the rule, however, is susceptible of further elu
cidation, I shall endeavour to exemplify in the sequel of consi
deration.    With a view of preparing to illustrate my position,-
I shall abstract both the rules in their analytical form (which                     I
shall do from Bonnycastle's Arithmetic), and subsequently their
practical enunciation :
Here a. the first debt.  I. the second. /= time between the
payments,  r. the  rate; and x. the equated time from the first
payment.
Here   d= the first debt, and its term t.            D=     the second, and its
term   T. x. the equated time.
  The first expression is Malcolm's rule, and the second is that
which I may properly term the old rule, as adopted by Cocker,
 and nearly all the authors on practical arithmetic who have fol
lowed in succession after him.        It depends on the supposition,
 " that the sum of the interests of the debts payable before the
equated time from their terms to that time, should equal the sum
of the interests of the debts due after the equated time from that
time to their terms."       But which also includes this extension ;
viz. "   that the  interest of the sum of the debts from the equated
time to the end of the final term is equal to the sum of the in
terests of the debts from their several terms to the end of the
final term *."
   And this I conceive to be the true intent and principle of the
rule ; namely, an equation of the party's separate right and in
terest in the debts, so that neither shall sustain los,s; or where is
the utility of determining an equated time at all? and which also
I take for granted was the primary object contemplated by the
founders of it.      But this object can never be accomplished in
Malcolm's     rule ; although, from the plausibility of making a pro
per  allowance    of discount, those who argue in favour of the rule
maintain that it is: but it is'an absolute fact, that one party will
be injured by       it,
                     and that party    always the debtor.
                                         is
   The main reason why Malcolm's rule fails in giving the true
  * For let there  be (wo payments: a. the first, and       b.the second; r.t..r.y
denoting the same quantities as before    ;   then (a.r.t) will he the entire  in
terest arising from the debts at the end of the last term; and to equate this
for the time(<      we should have {a.r.t)-=(u.r.t + b.t.T' a.r.x-\-b.r.x), and
                    x)
by reduction ((a + b). rx) = (b,r.t); or, {b.r-t ^{a.r.x+        =

after     itdue from its term to the equated time shall be equal

it  can he proved to be the true rule for two payments,                 must                       it

 time to pay the whole.        First by the common rule.
                  100x1    =   100
                   105x3 = 315          .
                         205        205-7-415          = 2^ years the equated time.
          205 4-(100.        x05 x2)=215-i-(100. x05.x2)=21-5
                         (21-51-42)*=420-25* = 20-5

   Now according to the first solution neither party will be the
loser     ; therefore obvious this circumstance cannot arise from
               it   is
the latter. Hence resuming the question under a different form of
calculation by allowing the true proportion of discount only;
let us observe how the result accords with that just obtained.

it may, be denoted by z. And I shall endeavour to seek it with

it will not -apply in those    cases where more than two payments
are concerned; by first equating for two, then a third, and so on,
a difficulty which the advocates for it hiive never attempted satis
factorily to explain ; yet it is said the equated time may be found
for any number of payments when the question is propounded in
numbers; but that it would be difficult to give a general theorem
for such cases : analytically, indeed, the thing is I believe hardly
possible to be effected.
    From the preceding discussion I feel persuaded it will appear
that the old rule is the true, and Malcolm's the false one ; and
I have been the more solicitous to point out the distinction be

the ambiguity in. Malcolm's to rest, because several eminent
Writers who rank high on the score of science have indiscri
minately one after another adopted it in their works, under the
impression of its being the only true rule : but if this mode of
reasoning be just, they must have rendered, and so will all suc
ceeding writers (who give the rule admission into their works)
at least render them erroneous in this respect. But if otherwise
it can be shown that what is herein advanced is not consonant
to the truth, as I am always open to the conviction of errors, so
 I shall be thankful, on my part, for the candid correction of them.

 LXVIII.      Answer to Objections, against   Mr. Horn's    Theory  of
                                  Vision*.
                            To   Mr. Tilloc/u
  StR,      I  perceivb by your last Number, that the opponents
 to my theory have increased :  still I am neither appalled by their
  number nor arguments.        I am disposed to draw a broad line of
  distinction between Mr. Pater and your correspondent J. Q. R.
  The latter gentleman's argument assumes something like a tan
  gible shape ; though I have to complain of his ex parte decisions.
  As my principles are already before the public, it is rather prepo
 sterous to ask, "What foundation has Mr. Horn for his theory ?"
     Your correspondent L.S. has partly avoided this inconsistency.
  Being in possession of my pamphlet, he has also corrected some
  of the errors into which Mr. P. and J. Q. R. have fallen. But
  while he does this with an apparent regard for justice, in order
  to render my optics ridiculous, he grossly misrepresents the de
  scription I have given of a phenomenon, which he found could

not be accounted for on any legitimate principles but by ad
mitting the truth of my theory.
   Now, sir, lest the imperfect view L. S. has given of the prin
ciples of my theory, and the confidence with which his
                                                           " single
objection" is urged, should prejudice the readers of your valuable
Magazine, I mean to show that this redoubtable objection is of
no avail ; and that the claims of the retina to the chief function
of vision are not only very doubtful, but that those of the optic
nerve are more consistent with the laws of optics, and better
supported by phenomena.
    J. Q. R. does not seem to be aware of the difficulties that
have presented themselves to men eminent for science, in their
investigations into the seat of vision, or he scarcely would have
spoken so confidently respecting the structure and use of the
retina. I have before noticed (Philosophical Magazine, vol. xlviii.
p. 118) the celebrated controversy between Marriotte and Pec
quet respecting the retina and choroid membrane.           De la Hire,
though he took part with Pecquet, arguing in favour of the re
tina, supposes that, our defect of vision, where the optic nerve
enters, is produced by the want of the choroides : accordingly,
he conceives that the retina does not receive the impressions im

mediately from the rays, but that they penetrate
the opacity of the choroides,      by
                                   which this membrane       agitated,
                                                               is
and these agitations being communicated to the retina, are

    When Dr. Priestley was composing his History of Vision, Mr.
 Michell suggested   a  number of additional arguments in favour
of the choroides as the immediate organ of vision, which had
escaped its former advocates.      These, though very ingenious,
                         "                                          "

shall not enumerate.     I    must own," says Dr. Priestley,       that
after having retained my prejudice         favour of the retina, not
                                          In
withstanding all that was advanced            Marriotte and the ad
                                               by
vocates for his opinion among his countrymen, the arguments of
 Mr. Michell, in favour of tbe choroides, have more weight with
me than  I   was at first either' able to perceive, or willing to ac
knowledge, in those of the French philosophers."        However, the
learned author, towards the conclusion of his History, in an
additional section relating to the seat of vision, gives up his
opinion of the choroides as the proper organ, and inclines to the
 hypothesis of De  la Hire.
    But these are not the only remarkable features in the physio
logy of the eye.    Even those who contend for the retina, as an
expansion of the optic nerve and the principal organ of vision,
express themselves either doubtfully,, or are at open variance with
each other, respecting the structure and requisite sensibility of
 this membrane.

                       Mr.Horri's Theory of Vision.                       275
   Haller, rejecting the hypothesis that goes to establish the
ehoroides as the proper instrument of vision, speaks of a certain
fibrous membrane in the retina, distinct from its pulpy substance,
and supposes that on these fibres the images of the objects are
painted.                                                                      ,

    " We have reason," says Dr. Reid, to believe that the rays of
light make some impression upon the retina ; but we are not
conscious of this impression ; nor have anatomists or philosophers
been able to discover the nature and effects of it;  whether it
             a vibration in the nerve, or motion of some subtile
Sroduces
  uid in the nerve, or something different from either, to which
we cannot give a name."                                     ...   ¦ . 
    Dr. Priestley observes, among desiderata at the end of his
History of Vision, that " something may possibly be added more
decisive for or against the retina being the place where the
pencils of rays terminate, or, in other words, being the seat of
vision,  than has as yet been advanced by the advocates for
either of the opinions."                                           ,-.   ¦ :
    Besides the suspicious circumstances already mentioned in the
character of the retina, there is another point which is not a
little embarrassing to the advocates for its being the seat of vi
sion. Although this membrane is expanded over the whole con*
cavity jof the eye as far as the ligamentum ciliare, they acknow
ledge that it is not all equally sensible.         The ingenious Dr.
 Porter field, in his treatise on the eye, observes, that this is evi
dent;  for instance, we are disposed to view the first letter of
            if,
any long word accurately, the other letters, especially those to
wards the end,will not appear clear and distinct. The cause of this,
he says, does not so much arise from the pencils of rays coming
from those letters falling obliquely upon the retina, but chiefly
because of certain degree of hardness, callosity, or insensibility,
              a
in all parts of the retina, excepting towards the axis of the eye,
directly opposite the pupil.
    But this opinion    is contradicted    in amore recent hypothesis
 advanced        Mr. Walker in his Archives of Science.
                  by                                             This au
thor supposes     that   the  images  of the external  objects are first
formed at the posterior portion       of the retina,  and       by
                                                                reflection
 from thence the impressions are made upon its anterior part.
"   Consistently," he says, " with the theory just delivered, should I
 conclude, that we have from this circumstance a decided proof
that the posterior part of the retina        utterly insensible
                                              is                     ; since

 wanting at this spot precisely, because where the nerve enters
there is  no ehoroides to reflect the rays to the sensible anterior
portion."                 :
                              .

        " It Is evident," says Dr. Reid,    " that    the pictures upon the
    retina are by the laws of Nature          of vision ; but in what
                                          a mean
    way they accomplish their end we are totally ignorant."
       From the different hypotheses respecting the seat of vision,
    and contradictory opinions as to the sensibility of the retina, the
    immediate inference that every unprejudiced inquirer must draw,
     i*,that their respective authors were alike uncertain as to the
    structure and use of this membrane  each found himself per
                                             :

       But whatever the difficulties may be respecting its texture,
    the nervous nature and origin of the retina are supposed demon
    strable from the constitution of the optic nerve.         It    allowed
                                                                   is
    by anatomists,    that  the nerve  possesses  two  tunics that envelop
    its medullary substance ; the exterior, derived from the dura
    mater, forming         by
                           its expansion .the sclerotic coat' of the eye;
    and the interior, which     is   acontinuation of the pia mater, ex
    pands itself on entering the eye, and forms the choroides.          The
    retina or innermost coat of the eye          therefore supposed to be
                                                is
    a  propagation of the nervous substance       ; the entire trunk of the
    optic nerve being thus naturally expanded into the principal
    coats that compose the globe of the eye.
       Now, however natural this arrangement of parts may appear,
    yet    Iconceive the 'fact) as far as  it  relates to the retina, to be
                                                  -
      very questionable.

                                           ,
          In the first place, the controversy so ably carried on, without
      clearly deciding the question, whether the retina or the choroides
    ,be the principal organ of vision, leaves the character of the for-
,     mer  in  suspense.    To say nothing of those inadequate hypotheses
     which Pecquet was forced to invent, in order to account for its
     insensibility upon the base of the nerve, some of its advocates
     strenuously contend, that the retina        is  every where insensible,
     except at     the  axis of  the eye. Others, with equal confidence,
     affirm that it   is totally insensible at the axis, and confine its sen
     sibility to the anterior portion.     On the contrary, Marriotte and
     others, who plead for the choroides, assert that the retina            is
     insensible tfiroiighout its uikole structure.        Le Cat, who held
     that the pia mater,- and not the nerves themselves,      is  the proper
     instrument of sensation, supposes that the retina answers          apur
     pose similar to the scarf skin covering the papillee pyramidales,
     which are the immediate organ of feeling.           The retina, he says,
     receives the impressionsof the rays^ moderates and prepares them
     for the proper organ, but       is
                                        itself insensible to any impression
     from the rays of light.                                               ^
         In the second place,   it   appears highly unreasonable to sup-
     posejso large    a   mass, as the medullary substance of the optic
                                                                       nerve,

nerve, necessary for the production of a membrane so very thin
 and delicate as the retina appears to be in its texture. "Some
 proportion certainly is discoverable between the sclerotic coat
and the dura mater, and also between the pia mater and the
 choroid membrane ;  but can any necessary correspondence be
discovered between the volume of matter contained in the trunk
of the optic nerve, and the small quantity requisite to form that,
thin lining for the choroides, called the retina ?             ~
   In the last place, no useful purpose has ever yet been assigned,
nor can possibly be conceived to arise from leaving a spot equal
to the base of the nerve destitute of the choroides, and totally
insensible to the rays of light. Besides, to impute either a total
or partial insensibility to any disposition of a substance which
is allowed by every physiologist to be the grand medium in
the animal eeeonomy, through which impressions on the organs
of sense are communicated to the common sensory, is, to say th«
'
best of  it,ait unaccountable anomaly in the nervous system.

respondent has, however, induced me to examine a number of
letters written by Dr. Waterhouse to Dr. Lettsom, and the notes
of letters transmitted by Dr. Lettsom to Dr. Waterhouse, to be
convinced of the truth or error of the statement 1 have made. From
this examination I am free to confess that Dr. L. does not appear
 to have first 6ent the vaccine lymph across the Atlantic.   I sub-
join extracts from these letters, that your readers may draw their
 own conclusion with respect to dates. I cannot, however, for
 bear expressing some degree of surprise that the practice of
 vaccination was not followed up by Dr. Chichester : for it is
 rather singular, that no mention of his name occurs but in the
 statement contained in the Philosophical Magazine, unless it be
 in the writings of Dr. Geo. Pearson, which I happen not to be
 in possession of, and to which it is at present not in my power
 to refer. Dr.Waterhouse, on the contrary, is frequently alluded
 to by various writers.    He was the active promoter of the prac
                   
 tice in America the person to whom the members of the Go- .
 vernment applied for lymph and for directions for its use, and to
 whom also his professional brethren looked for information on
 this subject.    He seems also, from the following extracts, justly
 to feel the responsibility of his situation on the occasion.     If,
 therefore, Dr.   VV. was not the first (which I confess appears to
 me doubtful) who vaccinated in America, it is but due to admit
 that it w^s by him that the practice spread through, and wqs
 finally established in, the United States.

LXX.     On a new Mode of preparing arsenicated HydrogenGas                   ;

[The experiments which this paper announces, possess a peculiar interest,
  from the melancholy fate of the experimenter, M. Gehlen, who fell vic   a
  tim to the dele terious effects of the gas, the constituents of which he was
  analysing. The account of them which follows, has heen made up from
  the memorandums he left behind him; and the observations which are

stilling apparatus fitted to collect the
                                      gas.  At first only the air
of the vessels was disengaged ; nor was any gas collected until
the greater part of the water had evaporated and the lye had
thickened and begun to bubble up.         A disengagement of gas
then commenced, which continued with rapidity until the mas»
was dried.     The gas which was obtained had no smell, and
burned with the slight and scarcely perceptible flame of hydrogen
gas.    The residue in the retort occupied a large space ; when
withdrawn it was found to be spongy, of a deep red brown in the
inferior part, and inclining to black in the superior, in the ca
vities of which some small octagonal crystals of arsenic were ob
served. The mass quickly attracted the humidity of the air, and
its colour changed from a red to a blackish brown. When water
                    it,
was thrown over     it  dissolved quickly, became heated, and dis
played a rapid ebullition, which however soon ceased.     The gas
which developed itself had the smell of garlic, somewhat resem
bling that of hydrosulphurio gas. After all the pieces of glass
were separated, and the finest of the crystals of arsenic washed,
the liquid part which was very alkaline was filtered, and the re
sidue washed upon the filter.

 desiccated and the temperature elevated.      The result of the de
 composition of water     bythe potash and the oxide of arsenic               is
 an arseniate of potash, which may also be obtained                by

                       and from this decomposition results arsenicated
    hydrogen gas, which disengages itself, because, similar to phos-
    phuretted hydrogen gas,            does not possess any acid properties,

    obtained           heating the arseniuret of tin with hydrochloric
                        by
    acid. One portion of liquid which was very alkaline, being                                 fil
    tered and supersaturated with hydrochloric acid, yielded but very                     a
    slight yellow precipitate with hydrosulphate of potash, and only
    discoloured         very small quantity of the red sulphate of man
                         a
    ganese.       Another    portion of liquid was saturated with acetic
    acid,   then    evaporated to dryness, and treated with very concen
     trated alcohol.      The acetate of potash was found to predominate
     in the base, although the two salts were originally neutral, and
     the residue consisted of arseniate acid of potash.               similar
                                                                            A                  di
    vision was obtained by evaporating neutral arseniat of potash,
    which never crystallizes so well as when combined with an ex-
     cess of acid, and then        it  analogous to tartrate of potash.

     more charged with phosphorus than that which                   produced
                                                                           is                    by
     heat.    I   may remark, that although arsenicated, phosphuretted,
     or carburetted hydrogen gas               decomposed at

           On Animalcules j particularly on the Polypes.              28&
    Arsenic acts upon barytes, but not so much as potash.                By
passing    the vapours    of arsenic  over  red  barytes,   a  combination
took place, the barytes being entirely penetrated with the ar
senic.     On adding cold water, no disengagement of gas took
place ; but by heat I obtained a little arsenicated hydrogen gas.
    I made afterwards a mixture of subcarbonate of soda in solu
tion and arsenic ; I put it into a glass vessel to which I had
adapted a tube to collect the gas, and exposed it to a red heat.
The arsenic began soon to volatilize, and disengaged but a small
quantity of carbonic acid, which might be owing to a little of the
oxide of arsenic which always accompanies arsenic exposed du*
ring some time to the air. The subcarbonate did not appear to
have experienced any alteration.
    From these observations it will be seen that arsenic has great
affinities to sulphur, and especially phosphorus; like them it
combines with several oxides, and like phosphorus it forms with
hydrogen gas a combination which does not possess acid pro
perties.     But it ought to be placed after phosphorus, because its
affinities are weaker, and it does not disengage the carbonic acid
of carbonates.
    In making these experiments I have had occasion to remark,
that hydrosulphate of potash dissolves an enormous quantity of
sulphuret of arsenic. I was led from that, to endeavour to neu
tralize the hydrosulphate from the sulphuret of arsenic by the
aid of a current of hydrosulphuric gas, but did not succeed.             At
the end of some days the hydrosulphate had allowed much of
the sulphuret to precipitate, although in a close vessel; but for a
long time it still preserved a considerable quantity.               HvdW-
sulphuric gas     has not,   however,  the  property,  like  potash, of dis
 solving any    sensible   quantity  of  sulphuret  of   arsenic.   I would
compare the hydrosulphate of potash and of arsenic to the
prussiate of potash and of zinc, which I have been equally unable
to obtain in a neutral state. In general hydrosulphuric acid has
a great affinity to hydrocyanic acid ; but its tendency to form
 triple combinations is not nearly so well marked.

     That science has received many advantages from the aid of
 different optical instruments is a fact universally established: but
 I shall now only instance them in what is termed the microscopic
world ; where principles and modes of animal existence have
been brought to light, amongst the different tribes of animal
cules, which must have remained unknown but for the aid of the
 microscope.     This circumstance, and the great degree of ob
scurity  which  still hangs about this branch of natural history, in
duced me to commence an inquiry into                 it,
                                                thinking that the dis
covery of other unknown laws and modes of animal existence
might reward the efforts of any one who had patience to pursue
the investigation     :and during this inquiry several results oc
curred which may not be unworthy of notice, as they may tend
to remove portion of the obscurity to which
            a                                         have alluded.
                                                               I
   If  we attentively examine most of the generally received opi
nions respecting the different tribes of animalcules, we shall find
them very unsatisfactory, as they lead to inductions which are                          in
compatible with that simplicity and correctness of design every
where discoverable throughout the works of creation.
    The opinions formed respecting the hydras, or fresh-water
polypes, arc of this character for;         stated
                                           it   is             by
                                                      most writers on
natural history, that polypes form       link
                                           a      the chain of created
                                                          in
beings which unites the animal to the vegetable kingdom, an in
ference resting chiefly on the supposed fact that they possess pro
 perties of both the animal and vegetable nature. That they possess
 several of the animal functions     very evident,
                                      is                        by
                                                         their power of
 moving    from  one place to another, and    of   swallowing and                       di
 gesting their food   cand that they have strong marks of the ve
 getable nature  is  equally certain; for when one of them          cut            is
 into several slips or pieces, each piece        little time becomes
                                                     in   a
a perfect being like the parent or stock from which         was taken,   it
 result which seems to establish its vegetable character: but
  a                                                                                     if
we attend minutely to several other circumstances, we shall find
that this reasoning -will lead to conclusions at variance with
themselves, and incompatible with the general harmony of Na
 ture.
    In the animal frame there  is  complete organization that runs
                                    a
through    the whole  being,  with which   the will or mind of the
animal seems intimately connected        but
                                           ;          if
                                                 any part       cutoff,       is
that part will not possess this completed organization, conse
quently its animal functions will be destroyed. With this general
view of the animal character, Jet us consider the various facts
related of this race of beings, which forms the supposed uniting
link between the two kingdoms.                                                *
   One of .the facts in favour of this conclusion         obtained  is                  by
cutting polype to pieces
        a                    in every direction fancy may suggest;
                                                                    for

            On Animalcules,  particularly    on the Folypes.     285-
for each part, whatever may be its shape, becomes a perfect
being in a little time.     Now this is not the case, even with every
part    of  a vegetable ; for in general it is only when they are cut
agreeably to certain rules that we can depend on an increase of
plants ;  hence the organization of these animalcules cannot be
so completely connected as that of vegetables.
     This opinion is supported by other facts related of this race
of beings; for portions of different polypes may be united to
gether, the head of one when brought into contact with the
trunk of another quickly forms a perfect union; they will also
 exist and perform all their functions after they have been turned
 inside outwards like a turned glove ; and that even if one polype
 be thrust into the body of another, they will unite and become
 one distinct animalcule.        These are results not only ineompa*
  tible with the exquisite formation of the animal frame, but dis
  play far less organization     than belongs, to the vegetable tribe.
  Yet how can this evident want of organization be reconciled
  with the animal functions they evidently do possess, which we
 know must depend upon a far more complete and connected
  formation than what obtains even among vegetables ?             This
 embarrassment gives birth to new opinions; but it is only from an
 extensive view of the subject, and the strictest attention to ex
  perimental results, that we can entertain a reasonable hope of
  being enabled to form more correct notions respecting this cu--
  rious branch of natural history.                                 .  .
      After having paid considerable attention to that class of ob
  jects termed animalcula infusoria, I concluded that the larger
   kind were portions of mucilaginous matter in which a great num
   ber of smaller animalcules resided, and that these animalcules
   had the power of shaping the mucilaginous masses, derived from
   the decaying vegetables and their own secretions, into such forms
  «s to be able. to move them by their aggregate force for all the
   purposes of pleasure, and existence.
      That these larger .animalcules are composed of a number of
   Jiving beings is highly probable; because when sttongly illuminated
   by an oblique light they seem to consist of very small distinct
   scintillating points, and *if we magnify them by a direct stead v
   light we discover that these small points are more .or less opaque :
   these appearances, therefore, naturally induce the inference that
    they are composed of a number of parts each possessing di
   stinctly the principles of vitality. When polypes are magnified
    they appear covered all over with dark spots ; therefore may we
    not conclude also, that these are small groups or single animal
   cules living in mucilaginous matter obtained from decayed vege
    tables and their own secretions, which they have the power of
   forming into the shape we call a hydra or polype?
                                                                   That

286      On Animalcules, particularly    on Ihe Polypesi
   That the whole tribe of animalcules possess animal functions,
and are not merely organic particles without these powers, as
Button and some others have imagined, is extremely evident ;
although there are some very peculiar phenomena attending
polypes which appear irreconcileable with this idea ; but perhaps
these peculiarities furnish the best means we have of ascertaining
the real nature and character of this curious race of beings.
That they possess animation we have the strongest evidence, and
that they have qualities corresponding to the vegetable character
seems equally certain ; and in my former remarks I have en
deavoured to show that their organization as a mass is not even
so complete as that of vegetables : therefore these seemingly ir
reconcileable principles,and the contrary results that attend them,
force upon us the conclusion, that they are merely portions of
mucilaginous matter, in which a great number of smaller ani
malcules reside, and that -these masses owe their organic cha
racter and animal functions, as Well as their curious varieties, to
the influence of these little creatures.
   Thus we obtain an easy solution to the wonderful fecundity
these beings display in their powers ofreproduction ; for, if they
are congeries of smaller animalcules, it readily explains why each
part when cut off from the rest should possess this reproducing
power ; for each part so cut must contain a number of these
smaller animalcules; consequently they will possess the same
functions as the collection from which they were taken, and will
instinctively exert their energies in giving to the portions of
mucilaginous matter to which they belong all the characters the
original mass possessed, which are doubtless the most appro
priate to their capacities and enjoyment.
   The experiments and observations which led to these conclu
sions were made during the last summer; but in the following
autumn and winter I obtained other results more decidedly in
favour of this transforming principle. About the latter end of
September I procured some water from a stagnant pool covered
with a large quantity of green matter, which appeared to be a
species of the conferva; this I anticipated would furnish a great
number of interesting objects for the microscope.          Upon ex
amining a part of this water I found it crowded with a vast
number of the enchelis, or small portions of green matter endowed
with a degree of animation; and agreeably to what I have sup
posed, they evidently derived this animation from the small ani
malcules they contained, which have generally been mistaken for
intestines.   These portions when seen distinctly appear rather
more elliptical than an egg, and each end is nearly transparent;
but generally the middle part seems the abode of about twenty
or more smaller animalcules, which swing from side to side when
                                                               these

          On Animalcules ,-^parlicularly       on the Polypes,      287
these aggregate animalcules are m motion, and are clearly the
means by which they move from one place to another.               When
the dark points    or smaller   animalcules   increased in number, the
middle of these mucilaginous masses, which I have termed ag
gregate animalcules, swelled out till they became almost round          J
at the same time losing a great share of their activity.          It was
in this inactive state they united in large quantities, and floated
without motion on the surface of the water ; yet they remained
in this apparently inanimate state but a short period ; for this
matter gradually       lost its green Vegetative appearance, and
became a brown mucilaginous body, which assumed new cha
racters.                  
     It was out  of this mucilaginous matter that numerous aggre
 gated animalcules of various kinds derived a more animated state
 of existence ; but the gradual change of a large portion of it into
different clusters of the polypes termed voriicellce, rendered this
 part of the process highly interesting, and strongly supported
 the idea that all the animalcula infusoria are aggregations of
 small animalcules living in lumps of mucilaginous               matter.
 Amongst     other  brown    mucilaginous portions   obtained  from  dif
 ferent quantities of water,    one  in particular did not give out any
 of the vorticeU(P,but an abundance of distinct large animalcules,
 which moved about with the greatest facility;  may we not there
 fore justly infer that, though their act of separation from the
 brown mass was not observed, they, as well as the whole tribe
 of what are called animalcules, are generated by a similar prin
 ciple to the vorticellce ?  an instinctive power which these dark
 molecules or smaller animalcules possess of giving to various parts
 of decayed vegetables and their own secretions all that variety
 of shape and character which belongs to this part of the animal
 kingdom ?
      In the various observations I made on stagnant water during
  the winter, I found that the green vegetative appearance which
  seemed to reside in the mucilaginous part of whati I have termed
  aggregate animalcules, varied with the weather; for when it be
  came mild this greenness increased, but as quickly decreased
  when the weather became cold, giving strong indications of the
  vegetable as well as animal nature of these little creatures.
       The production known among the natives of the East Indies
                   "
  by the name of Lalan lout, or sea-grass," gives a much stronger
  display of this two-fold character ; as its green appearance is such
  that it is mistaken by strangers for grass ; yet when caught in the
   hand it glides through the fingers and withdraws into the sand,
   leaving an impression of its mucilaginous and animated nature.
       As by the principles here developed it does not appear in
 compatible with what are termed the vegetable and animal pro
                                                                   cesses,

 ferred with some probability, that they exist and proceed to
 gether throughout the vegetable process? for innumerable quan--
 tities of small aggregate animalcules, similar to most I have
 mentioned, can be obtained from all young vegetable matter
 when subjected to infusion.  I hope this suggestion will induce
 others to turn their attention to these interesting phenomena :
 for it is only by a. more strict and extensive inquiry into this1
 branch of natural history, that we can expect to arrive at clear
 and satisfactory conclusions.
       LXXII.       On   a Coffee- Simmerer.      By Dr. Carey.
                              To   Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,-*- I he use of coffee becoming every day more extensive
 in this country, I presume that any suggestion, for the improve
 ment of that pleasing and salubrious beverage, cannot be unac
 ceptable to the public.   Under that persuasion, 1 beg leave to
 communicate a method of coffee-making, which I have long
 practised, and which I find to answer my purpose better than
 any other ; though I have tried several, and bestowed on the
 subject a share of attention, which your readers will hardly deem
 censurable, when apprised that coffee has, for the last three years,
 been my only beverage, except morning and evening tea.
    My process, sir, is that of simmering over the small, but steady
 flame of a lamp  a process, at once simple, easy, and (without
 watching or attendance) uniformly productive of an extract so
 grateful to the palate and the stomach, as to leave me neither
 the want nor the desire of any stronger liquor.
    But, to accomplish this, a vessel of peculiar construction ft
 requisite.  Mine is a straight-sided pot, as wide at top as at
 bottom, and inclosed in a case of similar form, to which it fe
 soldered air-tfght at the top.     The case is above an inch wider
than the pot  descends somewhat less than an inch below it-
 and is entirely open at the bottom  thus admitting and con
fining a, body of hot air all round and underneath the pot.  Thfe
lid is double ; and the vessel       of course, furnished with
                                    is,                       a  con
 venient handle and spout.
    In this simmerer, the extract may be made either with hot
water or with cold.      Ifintended Tor speedy use, hot water will
be proper, but not actually botting: and, the powdered coffee
being added, nothing remains, but to close the lid tight, to stop
the spout with  a cork, and place the vessel over the lamp; where
it may   remain  uu-attended     and unnoticed^ until the coffee  is
                                                               wanted

                          On a Coffee* Simmer er.
    Wanted for immediate use.          It may then be strained through a
    bag of stout, elose litien,' which will transmit the liquid so perfectly
    clear, as not to contain the smallest- particle of the powder.
        The strainer is tied round the mouth of an open cylinder, or
    tube, which is fitted into the mouth of the coffee-pot that is to
    receive the fluid, as a steamer is fitted into the mouth of a sauce
    pan j and, if the coffee-pot have a cock near the bottom, the liquid
    may be drawn out as' fast ahd as hot as it flows from the strainer.
        If the coffee be not intended for speedy use, as is the case with
    frie, who have my simmerer placed over my night-lamp at bed
    time, to produce the beverage- which is to serve me, the next day,
    at dinner and supper ; in such case, cold water may be used, with
    equal or perhaps superior advantage ; though I have never found
    titif perceptible difference in the result, whether the water em
    ployed was hot or cold.        In either case, it soon begins to sim
    mer, and continues simmering all night, without ever boiling over,
    and -without any sensible diminution of quantity by evaporation *
        With respect to the lamp although a fountain-lamp is un
    doubtedly preferable, any of the common small lamps, which ar6
    Seen in every tin-shop, will answer the purpose, provided that it
    contain a sufficiency of oil, to continue burning bright during
   the requisite length of time.  The tube, or burner, of my lamp,
  -is little more than one eighth of an inch in diameter: and this,
   at the distance of one inch and three quarters below the bottom
   of the pot  with the wick little more than one-eighth of an inch

       LXXIII.      Analysis of a vegetable colouring Mailer.
                         By  M,  Vauquklin.
M    . Thouin      has requested me to make an analysis of a new
species of lac, which has been sent him by M. Morenas.           .
    This substance, M. Morenas says, is found in hives constructed
by little insects, at the extremities of different trees, which being
entirely covered with them go soon to decay.
    Dr. Roxburgh says he observed some thousands of excessively
small animals overrunning this lac, and the branches to which
it is attached, the greater number of them issuing from small
holes which are in the surface of the hives.        These insects run
swift enough, but they are so numerous that they press one upon
               '
another.         ;
    The matter which forms these hives or cells has the appear
ance of transparent amber ; in each cell there appears a little
bag filled with a thickish red liquor similar to a jelly; the other
part of the cell contains a white matter.
    The Indians have given the name of lackscha to these cells,
because of the innumerable quantity of small insects which they
inclose  a lack signifying a hundred thousand.
    This lac has a red purple colour approaching to violet ; it has
no taste, but    jl  has a smell of amber similar to that of ants.     It
is neither soluble in water nor in alcohol ; yet with the aid of
heat a very slight violet colour may be drawn from it.
    The acids, and especially the sulphuric and muriatic, mixed in
water, dissolve this lac very easily, and convert its colour into a
bright red. During the dissolution of this matter in the acids,
 an effervescence is produced by a small quantity of carbonate of
lime which it contains.      The lac may afterwards be precipitated
from these acid solutions by means of the alkalies, provided no '
 more than a quantity sufficient for exactly saturating the acid
 is used.   The liquor still preserves after this precipitation a slight
 reddish colour.
    The alkaline carbonates dissolve still more promptly and
easily this colouring matter; the colour which the solution pre
sents is a beautiful violet.     As the alkalies precipitate this mat
 ter from the acids, so do the iicids precipitate it from the alkalies. ,-
 Flax, silk, or cotton, plunged into solutions of this lac, either in-/
 acids Or in alkalies, do not take any colour, unless prepared by
 suitable mordants.
    I have dyed flax of a very beautiful red approaching to
scarlet, by plunging it in an alkaline solution of the lac, after
 having prepared it with a hot solution of muriate of tin, and by
                                              ......
 turuing it by little and little in a mixture of the muriatic acid

with water. Siik I have also coloured by the same process ;
but the colour was not so rich,  it was that of the korlensia
rose.
     I have since proved the quality of the colour thus applied to
flax and silk, both with        soap and with slight acids, and I have
remarked that it does not detach itself.              The only effect pro
duced     is,that the acids make the colour pass to a red more lively,
and more like scarlet, and the soap on the contrary makes turn           it
to violet.      
                 .
     Flax and silk coloured with this substance preserve, even after
being dried, the odour of amber which distinguishes the lac.
     The solution of colouring matter in the alkaline carbonates
is   precipitated   by   solutions of tin or of alum into beautiful lacs,
 which are either red or violet according as the liquor remains
 acid or alkaline after the precipitation. These lacs appear to
 me very substantial.
  I     cannot doubt, after the experiment         Ihave made, slight as      it
 is, that the colouring matter          inquestion may be employed with
 success both for dyeing and painting.                  would, however, be
                                                         It
 desirable to procure      a   quantity sufficient for making greater and
 more varied experiments than the small quantity which                have
                                                                         I

  taken place, the liquid ought then to be strained through                   a

   gentle  heat,   so as  not  to destroy  the  colouring matter, and then
 put into vessels for transportation.

                                  I
  time seen the last Number of The Philosophical Magazine and
  Journal. Mr.       Farley, find, has there introduced my name in
                    J.            I
  relation to an oil obtained from "oil of wine."     must consider
                                                               I
  that his animadversions are at once precipitate and uncalled for.
                                        T    2                                My

 292                    Answer to    Mr. Farley.
  My remarks in reply shall be concise  indeed any notice from
 me verges on superfluity.
      I simply alluded to the residuum of the oil of wine when the
  ethereal vapour was expended in the minimum combustion de
  tailed ; I did not exalt it to the merit of a discovery, but indi
  rectly alluded to it as a thing the knowledge of which was not
  confined to me.       The terms were general, and Sir H. Davy
  might as well question the allusion made to the new acid gas.
 1 have never once said that it occurred to me, individually, in
 the prosecution of experiment.
     It cannot be my wish to deprive Mr. J. Farley of all the ad
 vantages which may result from his mighty discovery of the
 '' peculiar fixed oil," For my own part, it is, I think, with the
 iitle of discovery, too splendidly adorned.         However, we. shall
 no doubt receive a masterly analysis of its chemical constituents
 from this gentleman ; until which period, I shall certainly hesi
 tate to rank as a new body what only " seems" to be " a peculiar
 fixed oil," from a superficial and, cursory examination of it. .
     I cannot charge my memory at present with any conversation
 with Mr. Farley relative to this substance, except that he told
 me at one time, it was heavier than water, and at another period,
 lighter.     In the first instance, 1 distinctly told him that I had
  Jjried platinum in oil of wine.    Certainly, if a person has made
 q discovery, he has a right to publish it  My paper only detailed
 " the phenomena of platinum and other wires in inflammable
  media."      I shall not envy Mr. Farley his discovery  I only say
 that he has been rash.
      I read with some interest Dr. Clarke's proposition for an im
 provement in the oxihydrogen blowpipe, in the. last Number of
 the Annals of Philosophy; because you yourself proposed to
 me exactly such an appendage, to increase the intensity of the
 flame, two or three mouths ago*.        The rough sketch you gave
 me at the time, I have somewhere in my possession.        There can
.be no doubt but that such a fasciculus would exalt the ignition.
      I omitted to mention an experiment by which any one may
 satisfy himself of the success of the appendage I have presumed
 to recommend to Davy's lamp, by which it may relight itself.
 Compress a spiral wire of the thickness of a knitting needlej heat
 this red hot, blowout the candle and bring it over the wick like
 an extinguisher.      It will be immediately rekindled.
   * The
           proposal alluded to was to interpose a bundle of capillary tubes
between the holder of the compressed mixture of gases, and the small tube
through which it is ejected on the lamp; but as I had not applied it to use
in any way whatever, or published     it, but the same idea may have oc
curred to others, the merit belongs in justice to Dr. Clarke, who firstgave
it to the public.  A. T.

      Your reply, sir, to Mr. Stephenson is most conclusive,    and
will            generous and candid minds accepted, as fatal to
        be by all
the priority claimed most unwarrantably by this person.         Mr.
Stephenson, however, has one merit, namely, that of an exact
copyist,  witness even the trimmer for the lamp. The miner
will remember his " Davy" with gratitude, when the " Idea" of
Stephenson will be consigned to nitive
                                              " nothingness." The
beings of former ages could never have anticipated the happy
period when the miner should encounter a magazine of fire-damp,
in full consciousness of security, and, as Lord Erskine well ex
presses

of thirty feet ; its roots yield camphor ; its leaves are seven or
 eight inches long and two or three broad ; its flower is white,
and of a most disagreeable odour ; but its berries are greedily
 devoured by the birds.     What is called cassia is the receptacle
 and unripe seeds of the laurus cinnamomum.         In Ceylon there
 are four cinnamon plantations containing from 1000 to 3000
 acres each : three of them are represented as being well culti

    A paper by Mr. Thomas Lauder Dick, on the appearances
 called the "Parallel Roads" in Glenroy, in the shire of Inverness.
This glen extends about eight or nine miles from NE. to SW,
and consists of six or seven distinct vistas or reaches, produced by
the projections and bendings of the hills. It is very narrow, and.
the river Roy runs along its bottom.        On the sloping sides of

                Royal Medical Society    of Edinbtirgh.            295
 the hills on each  side are seen what have been called the Parallel
Roads,  a series   of shelves receding one above another, through
 the whole extent    of the glen.   In most parts they are three in
number, in some      parts only two : in one place five are distinctly
perceptible.     Each shelf preserves a horizontal position through
out the length of the glen.        The second road is about thirty
yards lower than the first, and the third about sixty lower than
the second.     In number, height, and position, they are similar
on the opposite sides of the glen.       Their surface inclines out
wards in a slope of about one foot in five, and their greatest
breadth is about twenty yards, but in many places much less
where the materials of the hills are hard.
   These shelves, which some have supposed to be artificial, Mr.
Dick shows, very satisfactorily, must have been produced by the
action of the surface of a vast lake, which must have filled the
valley, but undergone a series of successive subsidences, by the
bursting out of its waters, corresponding         to the number of
" roads" now visible. He has, he thinks, ascertained the point
in the glen through which the waters rushed when the lake sub
sided to the second level.
   Mr. Dick supports his theory by observations made on the
margins of deep lakes in the Highlands, and by an analogous
road or shelf, which surrounds a valley above the town of Su-
biaco, forty- six miles east from Rome, and which is known to
have been once on a level with the waters of the lake, by the
ruins of the baths of Nero, and of the aqueduct by which Ap-
pius Claudius conveyed water from this lake to Rome, though
the lake is now much lower.
   Dr. Brewster communicated experiments made by himself and
Dr. Gordon on the human eye, relating chiefly to the refractive
power of the aqueous, vitreous, and crystalline humours, and to
the polarizing structure of the different parts of this organ. Con
trary to the received opinion, the aqueous and vitreous humour
were found to have refractive powers greater than that of water,
that of the vitreous humour being the highest.        The crystalline
lens exhibits a polarizing structure exactly the same as quartz,
or one set of doubly-refracting crystals, or the same as the mid
dle coats of the crystalline lens in fishes (Phil. Transac. Lond.
for IS 16, p. 31 1.). The iris has the same structure, but the
cornea had an opposite structure, nearly the same as that of cal
careous spar ; or the same as the outer and inner coats of the
crystalline lens in fishes.    The tint polarized by the crystalline
of the human eye is a faint blue of the first order.

    March 17.       Mrs. Grose favoured the Society with some spe
 cimens of the Cicada mannajerens,           or locust of New South
 Wales, and likewise of the wild honey or manna deposited by
 that animal on a large forest tree called the Eucalyptus.      This-
 insect continues but a short time in its winged state : it was first
 observed in November 1800, by Colonel Paterson, in the pupa
 state, and on the same day it appeared with its wings through
 an opening in the back of the outer covering; it was then in a
                                                                 very

very weak state, and slowly left its original abode. The rapiditv
with which the insect enlarges after this, is surprising ; in the
course of a few hours it can                   fly
                                     to the top of the tallest eucaly
ptus,  which  generally grows  to  the  height of sixty or seventy feet.
On this tree Colonel Paterson first discovered the manna in great
quantities, apparently produced                      by
                                        these insects.       may be col

of the same appearance, and which makes the same sort of noise,
but produces no manna.
   Mr. Eckersall observed that the locust, when used as food,
contracts the usual period of life, and induces that cutaneous
affection of winged insects generated on the surface of the body,
producing universal ulceration.
   Dr. Wilkinson stated that he had received            letter from Mr.
                                                                 a
Bakewell the geologist, communicating that, from some obser
vations on basaltic formations, he was led to believe that the
basalt makes its appearance at Wick and dips under Bath,- v

         it
springs.
    The Society proceeded to the consideration of         paper for   a
merly presented        Dr. Wollaston relative to the theory of the
                               by
diamond cutting glass.       was stated by Dr. Wollaston, that the!
                                      It
natural point of the diamond answered better than an artificial
point and that, in cutting glass, the line described         tangent
         ;                                                                is

to the face of the diamond.       Dr. Wilkinson mentioned that he
had some micrometers made           the late Mr. Coventry, where the
                                               by
Jines on glass had been so finely drawn, that the cross lines formed
a series of squares so minute that twenty-five millions of squares
are only equal to one square inch.       Dr. W. observed, that when
a glass    cut properly
             is              diamond, the line of section has
                                     by   a                      very-         a

     A member mentioned, that it had been publicly stated to be
 in agitation, to contrive an apparatus by which 1000 gas lights
  might at once be lighted by electrical means. Dr. Wilkinson
  said that he did not deem any electrical apparatus at present
  existing, competent in its highest state of excitement to pro
  duce such an effect.       Supposing the wires at each light one-
  tenth of an inch distant from each other, the sum of all the
 striking distances would be equal to one hundred inches, when a
 thickness of plate of air to be broken through would require a
 plate machine twenty feet in diameter, the glass part of which
 could not be made for 100,000/.
     Dr. Wilkinson next directed the attention of the Society to
 the application of his mechanical theory to the phenomena of
 light.    He referred to the change of direction in a ball when
 obliquely impelled out of air into water, and this he denominated
 the refraction of the ball: however inclined, the ratio of devia
 tion is constant and uniform, depending on the difference of re
 sistance between the two media.         The same principle Dr. W.
 applied to the refraction of light.      He considers all transparent
 bodies with respect to light, the same as conductors with respect
 to electricity ; that is, that the* transparency depends on the uni
versal diffusion of light with the transparent substance, and that
 the first portion of light which is rendered apparent, is that
which previously existed in the substance impelled by the super
induced quantity.
    April 7- A paper by Mr. Eckersall, on Locusts, having been
read, Mr. Chapman favoured the Society with some remarks in
opposition to the theory advanced in it by that gentleman.          He
objected strongly to the supposition of Mr. E. that any ova
which might be conveyed into the stomach through the medium
of the locusts, when made use of as food, could afterwards force
their way to the skin, so as to form that cutaneous disease re
presented by Diodorus Siculus and other writers, ancient as well
as modern, to be so very dreadful in its effects.      The President
observed, that the cutaneous disease was more probably a con
sequence of constitutional debility occasioned by the use of a
food containing so little nourishment.
    The plan of a new drag or creeper, for searching for drowned
bodies, was presented to and approved of by the Society.             It
consists of an iron rod, at least six feet in length, divided into
three parts by two joints ; so that (the sides of rivers being ge
nerally sloping) the two extremities of the rod may lie on either
bank, while the central part keeps its horizontal position on the
bed of the river j to which rod are attached a number of creepers
                                                                    at

       Mr. Rotch favoured the Society with the sight of a beautiful
  glass flute, made in Paris, of very superior workmanship and
  tone.      Mr. R. expatiated at    some   length   on the superiority
  which glass possesses over every other substance for the propa
  gation of musical vibrations, owing to its peculiar elasticity j and
  the high polish of which it is susceptible.
       April 14. Mr. Ricardo having directed the attention of the
  Society to the melancholy case of imputed murder by poison,
  which occurred lately at Falmouth, and to the conflicting opi
  nions of the medical men examined on the occasion ; Dr. Wil
  kinson remarked, that in all cases where arsenic is suspected, it
  is unsafe to depend on any one apparent proof of its presence;
  and that it is only from a combination of a great manyunequi-
  vocal proofs that a sound inference can be drawn.           Although
  the ammoniated nitrate of silver applied to a solution of arsenic
  produces a lemon-coloured precipitate, yet the shade so. nearly
  corresponds with that arising from the same test in combination
  with the phosphate of soda, that the one may be easily mistaken
  for the other.      [Perhaps the only perfect and indubitable test,
  as stated by one of the witnesses on the trial, Dr. Neale of
  Exeter, is . the reproduction of the arsenic by sublimation. 

    -  Dr. Wilkinson afterwards resumed- the explanation of his
  mechanical theory of electricity .      Metallic bodies, he observed,
  contain the largest quantity of electricity, and non-conductors
  the least, the quantum being always proportionate to the capa
  city of the substance.       Thus sponge, wood, and marble, when
  immersed in water and then removed, produce equal effects on
  the hygrometer.         The quantity of water each retains is very
  different, but it is the excess above their respective capacities
  that influences the hygrometer.        The same law the Doctor ap
  plied to caloric, conceiving it to be only the excess of heatabove,
  the calorific capacity of the body that affects the thermometer ;
  and that to alter that capacity some change in its constituent
  parts must take place.        ..
        In the case of a. conductor of electricity, the Doctor supposes
   this principle to prevail so much, that a continued chain of
   communications must exist between the electrical particles. The
   first spark received from the prime conductor of an electrical
   machine he considers to be the natural electricity of the con
   ductor driven forward by a superinduced quantity ;  in the same
   manner as in the case of water impelled- through a tube, the
"    t-  ,                                                      portion

portion which passes out at one end is driven forward by' the
portion passing in at the other.
  In illustration of the change produced in electrical capacity
by a change in the constituent particles of a substance, the
Doctor remarked how imperfect a conductor metal becomes
when oxidated;  that in other substances the conducting powers
 are increased by an increase of temperature :  thus vapour is a
better conductor than water, and water than ice, and the latter
when at a very low temperature becomes a non-conductor.
    The quantity of electricity existing in the atmosphere, Dr. W.
considered to be principally regulated by the proportion of va
pour distributed through the air, dry air being known to be an
excellent non-conductor ; and to this resistance which electricity
experiences with respect to air, the Doctor ascribed the develop
ment of its true principles.      Were air a conductor, no electrical
changes could occur, since there could not be any accumulation
on the one part nor deficiency on the other we should, in short,
be deprived of all the advantages we derive from atmospherical
electricity. But as it        is,
                             action cannot take place without un
folding a portion of this enlivening principle. The evaporation
of drop of water, equally with the concourse of floating fields
   a
of vapour, elicits more or less electricity and         ;        from the
                                                                it       is
process  of equalization   which   takes  place when   showers    descend
on plants containing   different  proportions   of electricity, that  that
action proceeds   which   excites   and  stimulates  vegetation.
    Dr. W. concluded     by
                          observing that he should apply these prin
ciples to the explanation of the Leyden phial at the next meeting.
       LXXVII.       Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
               EXPLOSION OF AN ENGINE-BOILER.
On     Friday morning the 4th of April,           most lamentable oc
                                                    a
currence took place     at Norwich.     Just  after  the steam packet,
bound from that place to Yarmouth, had started, and before she
had proceeded twenty yards, the boiler burst with most dreadful
                                                            a
explosion.     The boiler was cylindrical vessel, about eight feet
                                        a
long and    four feet two inches     diameter, of wrought iron, ex
                                            in
cepting   one  end,  which  was  made   of cast iron. The latter gave
wav, and was propelled towards the stem of the vessel, while the
body of the boiler was thrown in horizontal direction out of the
                                             a
stern, sweeping all before      at the same time that the concussion
                               it   ;
of the  air  and steam  completely unroofed the vessel from one end
to the other.
  When the explosion took place there wer« twenty-two people

on board, of whom only four remained unhurt.    Nine were killed,
and the remainder more or less wounded ; and of the latter three
are -since dead, the engine-man, named Diggins, being one of
them.
   As might be expected, this event has spread a very general
alarm, and proved injurious to the business of vessels employed
in steam navigation ; from an idea that accidents of this kind
cannot be guarded against, but must be expeeted as a matter of
common occurrence, from the nature of the moving power em
ployed; especially if the steam engine be what is commonly
called a high pressure engine, that is an engine worked with
steam of forty pounds pressure per square inch, or upwards.
That people ignorant of the properties and management of steam
should reason thus is not wonderful, but that men who call them
selves engineers should assist in propagating such errors is sur
prising.   .
   Every     accident of this kind may be traced either to faulty
construction, or criminal mismanagement.              If a boiler can be
made to work safely under a pressure of four pounds per inch,
it is self-evident that one made of ten, fifteen, or twenty times
the strength, may be worked with equal safety under a pressure
of forty, of sixty, or of eighty pounds the inch. What competent
engineer would avow that he could not make a boiler sufficiently
strong to resist a pressure of 200, or even 300 pounds per inch ?
Rut if the safety valve of the boiler be locked down, whether
constructed to resist four pounds or 400 pounds, what can be
expected hut an explosion ?
 . From all. that, we have been able to learn respecting the ex
plosion at Norwich, we have no doubt whatever that it was ow
ing to faulty construction, criminal hardihood of the engine-man,
and culpable mismanagement. The boiler was made of two kinds
of materials, of different expansive powers when influenced by
changes of temperature: this ought never to take place. The cast-
iron end was a flat plate, with a double circular rim at a right angle
to   it,
       like the lid of snuff-box
                      a            ;    this was slipped over the end of
the wrought iron cylinder.          Through the double rim and the
interposed cylinder of wrought iron were passed numerous bolts
from the inside, and these were secured         by    screw-nuts on the
outside  that  is,  in such a manner that the very operation of
screwing home the nuts had     a     tendency to fracture the cast-iron
plate  at  the  turn of its rim  to
                                 a     right angle. The space between
the rim and the cylinder was filled with the usual cement. The
plate itself was only, as we are informed, about three quarters
6f  an inch in thickness  !    and
                                 it     was usual to raise the steam to
a  pressure of seventy pounds the inch before starting for the
voyage. At the time the explosion took place, the. attendant
 v                                                            engineer       .

engineer was Sitting across the boiler, working home a screw
into some part of the machinery, consequently not attending to
the height of his steam, and possibly, from his position, pre
venting the possibility of the safety valve rising to allow of the             *
escape of any steam, whatever the pressure might be ; while at
the same time the end of the boiler was quite incompetent to
hazard such a pressure as even seventy pounds per inch ; and if
only a few degrees of heat were then added, the expansive force
would very soon be doubled !       Indeed, we have every reason to
 believe, that on the present occasion the steam was wilfully urged
 to a degree beyond all prudence.      In fact, the explosion seem*
 to have taken place from precisely the same kind of blameable
 and obstinate conduct which has so frequently occasioned serious
 mischief to passengers in stage-coaches. A rival steam-boat was
 started at the same time, and the engine-man of the one that
 exploded had been heard to declare, that he would beat the
 other in the voyage, and was then actually urging his steam to
 outrun the other boat.                       , -
     But, because stupid pretenders venture sometimes to meddle
 with an agent with whose powers they are not sufficiently ac->
 quainted ; and risque their Own lives, and endanger others, by
 employing boilers which they have not even subjected to a cold-
 water proof *, would any one be so foolish as to propose parlia
 mentary interference to put an end to the use of steam of high
 temperature in any of the machinery or numerous processes car
 ried on in this country ? Yet there are men, who either from
  stupidity, or from something more blameable, have been talking
 in this foolish way.    As well might it be suggested, that men
 should be prohibited from riding on horse-back, or travelling in
  carriages, because numerous accidents are thus occasioned which
  could not possibly happen if people were compelled to walk upon

    Diggins,    who   was before  a  common     labourer,  was first em
ployed to attend      a steam engine    in the   brewhouse   of Alderman
Patteson of Norwich.          In Mr. Patteon's service he was so ob
stinate and fool- hardy that his employer often reproved him,
and was obliged to interfere and to make him rake out the fire.
 His master was absolutely afraid at last to go into the premises.
    When he left this employ, whether dismissed for obstinacy,
or tired of the reproofs of his prudent master, we know not, he
was engaged as engine-man to the Hope steam packet-boat. We
have been informed by Mr. Watts, a respectable engineer of
 Norwich, that while in that boat he has frequently detected him
urging the steam to 20 pounds the inch  how much higher he
                           1
 may have urged       itat times no person can tell.
     From the Hope he went to the Telegraph, and while he at
 tended that vessel he went on precisely in the same mad man
 ner
   ;     and when the mischief occurred was actually trying race     a
 against    arival packet which had got the start of the Telegraph,
 determined either to pass her or force the Telegraph into her
 wake  In fact, in place of steam of 60 pounds, as has been sup
 posed, he must from his known mode of firing have had steam
of 20 lbs. or probably much higher.

 joining   of  the cast-iron  end.    The  man,   alarmed     the  effects of
 his own folly, lost his recollection, and was attempting none can
 tell what, and had got on the top of the boiler when           itexploded.

             FARTHER ERRORS IN THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC.
                              To   Mr. Tillochi
      Sir,  In   the explanation inserted at the end of every Nautical
  Almanac it is stated that " the conjunctions of the moon with
  the planets, or stars not less than the fourth magnitude, whieh
  may prove occultations in some inhabited parts of the globe, are
  evidently designed to instruct mariners or travellers to look out
frequently for such observations : which, if they happen to jrrove
  occultations, and are carefully observed, will afford a certain
  means of determining the longitude of the place of observation."
  Yet, notwithstanding the declared utility of this method, and the
  obvious intention of the publication of the Nautical Almanac, it
  is much to be regretted that the Astronomer Royal (under whose
  directions this work is formed) should have neglected, of late years,
  to insert the several conjunctions of the moon with the fixed
  stars ; whereby many persons are prevented from looking, out
  for such conjunctions as may prove to be occultations at the places
  where they are stationed.
      It is true that a few of these conjunctions are inserted :; buty
  many others, which have even proved occultations in this coun
  try, are not so much as noticed.         For instance, the only co«-
junction      inserted in the list  of  phenomena for the last month
  (March) was (i Scorpionis ; the time of which, by thehy, was
  set down at least an hour too late.          There were, however,, no
  less than two occultations in the course of the same month; viz.
  of   f  Virginis on the 4th, and of % Leonis on the 29th ; both
  of which were seen in London. In the Connaissance des Terns
   these conjunctions are carefully noted; and the editors of that
  work justly observe, that " Les occultations d'e*toiles par la hjne
  £tant les phenomenes les plus utiles pour determiner avec preci
  sion les longitudes geographiques, les voyageurs ne doiyent pas:
  negliger de les observer: les conjonctions, qu'on indique ici,
  serviront a les guider pour preVoir les occultations qui pourront
   avoir lieu dans les pays ou. ils se trouveront.'*  Agreeably to these
   principles, a long list of conjunctions and other phenomena,
   occupying no less than six pages, is given in every volume of that
   work,                                        *        : :         v -

such things in our National Ephemeris, every one must be sensi
 ble of the importance and propriety of having all those pheno
 mena carefully computed which are thought worthy of being in
 serted : and it is to this point more particularly that I wish to
 call . the attention of your readers.            It was announced in the
 Nautical Almanac that, last night, there would be an occultation
 of at Librae; and I accordingly made every preparation for ob
serving it. But what was my surprise to find that the border
 of the moon did not approach within ten or twelve minutes of
 the star ; and that consequently ho occultation took place ! This
fact led me to suspect the accuracy of the notice for the ensuing
.month (May), where an occultation of the same star is an
nounced on the 28th.            It is true that an occultation of that star
will take place on that day ; but it will happen near an hour
 sooner than the time set down in the Nautical Almanac.                Indeed
the emersion of the star will actually take place above eighteen
minutes before the time set down in the Nautical Almanac as
the commencement of the occultation.                 So that those persons
who depend on the time in the Nautical Almanac, will be de
prived of the opportunity of observing this interesting and beau
tiful appearance*
    The following comparison of the apparent times of the phe
nomenon above alluded to may,              perhaps,    be interesting   to se
veral of your readers.

moon with /3 Scorpionis is incorrectly stated : the same remark
will apply to the conjunctions of Jupiter with the same star on the
14th of July and the 10 th of August; neither of which will take
place.     It is evident that the computer has assumed the longi
tude of the star greater than it really is.

They were made by Rondelet, and published by him in 1802*.
They were republished in the works of Gauthev, edited by
Navier in 1809f.
   The specific gravity and resistance of .the stones agree exactly
with the tables of Rondelet, except in the instance of the pu
mice stone, which differs considerably.    It was not to be expected
that the resistance of different kinds of stones would be in pro
portion to their specific gravities; as the resistance of com
pound stones, particularly of the cemented kinds, such as grit or
sandstones, must depend on the nature of the cementing material,
which is frequently soft and friable ; and consequently such stones,
however heavy, will crumble in pieces under a moderate pressure.

   Messrs. Majendie and Pelletier have communicated to the
Academy of Sciences at Paris an interesting discovery upon ipe
cacuanha.       appears that these gentlemen have succeeded in
                It
separating  the principal substance to which the good effects of
ipecacuanha in medicine are owing, from those adjuncts which
give  itthat pdour and taste so disagreeable to invalids.« They
have named this principal substance hemetine.      great number         A
of experiments and observations have been made, which fully
confirm the truth of the discovery.

          EXPERIMENTS WITH THE OXI-HYDROGEN BLOW-PIPB.
       A letter just received from our valued correspondent M. Van
    Mons of Brussels communicates the following information :
       " The Marquis RidOlphi of Florence has reduced earths with
    much ease by means of the gaseous mixture of Clarke. Brugna-
    telli had already made use of the same contrivance.    He writes
 me, that he has constructed for this purpose a small apparatus,
very simple, which is composed of two bladders, the one filled
with phlogogene gas and the other with therm-oxygen. The
 tube which conducts the latter gas is of a diameter the double
of that which conducts the former ; and the bladders are com
pressed by a bar of iron.    The effect is prodigious.
    " M. Ridolphi has not only procured the metals from earths, but
he has combined them to platinum and gold.          These combina
tions are always white, have a metallic brilliancy, and are mallea
ble.   Being introduced into oxygenated muriatic gas or into
Oxygen gas, they enter immediately into a state of combustion,
and form in the first case muriates, and in the second case re
generations of the earth, oxidations taking place at the same
time of the metal in union. One circumstance very remarkable
    is,
    that during that oxidation     always forms itself with waterj
                                        it
the drops of which condense upon the sides of the recipient     and  ;
this has constantly happened in spite of every care being taken
to dry completely not only the apparatus but the mixture.
   " The metals of earths thrown into nitric acid or oxygenated
muriatic acid dissolve quickly, occasioning a hissing noise simi
lar to that of a hot iron plunged into water.
   " The oxides of cobalt, platinum, and of gold, are reduced
                                   of
in an instant under the flame of the gaseous mixture      but after
                                                               ;
their reduction they inflame and are oxidized anew.
   " The metals of earths, decompose, in oxidizing, carbonic acid
gas and water, but more slowly than the metals of alkalies.
   " Of all the metals of earths, zircon that which allies itself
                                                  is
in the greatest proportion with platinum and gold.
   " Alumine, silex, lime, and the carbonates of lime and of
barytes, have been fused, but in no experiment have they yet been
metallized or reduced.
        "
      Stiontimi and magnesia are reduced easily, provided they
are formed into paste with charcoal and oil, the paste being             di
vided into pills and left to harden          by
                                         heat.   Without this pre
paration these earths do not fuse equally, but are fused and vitri
fied.
     Zircon alone deoxidizes without the aid

                          says that under the flame
meteoric stone, which fell at L'Aigle in Normandy, was reduced
into metallic iron without losing any of its weight.  A piece of
stone which fell at Stanner in Moravia, submitted to the same
trial in the laboratory of the University of Pavia, did not experience
any such effect.      The thunder which forms these stones must
possess at least as much intensity of heat as this new flame.
                                 GAS FROM    Oil.
     Mr.   J.   B. Bmmett of Hull        has published some    experiments
which  he made during the summer of last year, with a view of
ascertaining whether a gas might not be obtained from oil, equal
to that obtained from coal ; so as to prevent the injury threatened
to the Greenland trade by the rapidly increasing use of the lat
ter in the lighting of towns, &c.        By distilling various oils pre-*\
viously mixed with dry sand or pulverized clay, at a temperature
little below ignition, he obtained a gas which appeared to be               ft'
mixture of carburetted hydrogen and supercaiburetted hydrogen
gases.    This gas produces        flame equally brilliant, and often
                                    a
much more brilliant than that produced from coal.               It

very little in quality, whether obtained from mere refuse, or front
good whale sperm, almond or olive oil, or tallow.               The gas
when burnt produces no smoke, and exhales no smell or unplea
sant vapour.     Whatever oil        used,
                                    is       evolves much more light

    With respect to the interest of the Greenland traders in this
discovery, Mr. E. observes, that fish oil has long been banished
almost entirely from private houses and shops  and that in the
shape of gas light its safety and oeconomy may again introduce
            a
it into these places, and thus increase in no inconsiderable de
gree the consumption of oil  particularly since the gas may be
rendered so far portable, that houses situated in parts of          town

   The Berlin Gazette gives the following account of this expe

 come to hand.       Mr. V. Kotzebue discovered three new islands
 in the South Sea in 14° of latitude and 144° of longitude. To
  these islands he gave the names of Rornanzow (the author and
 equipper of the whole expedition), Spiridow (an admiral under
 whom Kotzebue formerly served several years), and Krusenstem
  (with whom he made his first voyage round the world). Besides
 these he discovered a long chain of islands in the same quarter,
  and two clusters of islands in the 11th degree of latitude and
  190th degree of longitude.     (It is not specified whether the lati
 tude is N. or S. or the longitude E. or W.)          These he called
  after his ships Rurick's Chain ; the two latter    Kutusow's  Cluster
  (a group) and Suwarrow's Cluster.         All these islands are very
 -woody, partly uninhabited, and dangerous for navigators.         The
  discoverer has sent to Count Romanzow a great many maps and
 drawings. On the 12th of July O.S. Kotzebue designed to sail
  from Kamtschatka to Behring's Straits, according to his instruct
  tions.   He hopes to return to Kamtschatka in September 1817.
  On the whole voyage from Chili to that place he had not a single
person sick ou board.      He touched at Easter Island ; but did
not find the inhabitants so friendly as La Peyrouse describes them.
  He thinks that something must have happened since that time
  which has made them distrustful of the Europeans : perhaps it
  may be the overturning of their surprisingly large statues, which
  Kotzebue looked for in vain, and found only the ruins of one of
  them near its base, which still remains.      He saw no fruits from
  the seeds left by La Peyrouse, nor any sheep or hogs, which by
  this time must have multiplied exceedingly.        A single fowl was
   brought him for sale.    It seems we may hope much from this
  young seaman, who is not yet thirty years of age. He was obliged
  for many reasons to leave the learned Dane Wormskrold behind,
  in Kamtschatka.
                            SCARLET DYE.
      Sir,  I should be much obliged to any of your scientific cor-i
   respondents that would inform me, through the medium of your
   Magazine, of a met hod to prepare a beautiful scarlet dye of suffix
  cient depth of colour for immediate use.        I have not succeeded
  in its preparation by any formule hitherto proposed by chemists,
   even when the experiments were made with the greatest care
   and exactness, and the articles operated upon were of the irt--
   most purity.    There are two or three wholesale chemists in
   London, who prepare a scarlet of great durability from a sub
   stance not one quarter of the price of cochineal. These persons
   supply dyers with the article ready prepared forimmediate use.
   Surely a knowledge of this substance would be a great acquisition
   both to the chemist and dyer.

they conveyed no nutriment to the tree, but were supported by
it. At length they dipped into the earth, and have since enabled
the tree to grow with vigour.        Between the top of the wall and
the surface of the earth they have never thrown out either
branches or leaves, but have coalesced round the wall into a sort

     A few weeks   ago   a  pair of grosbeaks (Lo.via Cocothraustes)
were shot in a field belonging to Mr. Beaufoy at Upton Gray
in Hampshire.       This bird is very uncommon in the south of.
England,     and  was  probably attracted into the neighbourhood of
Upton Gray by the plantations of pine and fir. The above two
specimens were shot out of a small flock consisting of six of
                                                                        ',

                               LONGEVITY.
     The following circumstance may be interesting to those who
inquire into the causes of longevity :
     A gentleman of considerable research lately made a catalogue          *,
of near eight hundred      persons who had attained a great age, and
found their habits of life only to agree in one particular, namely,
early rising in the morning.      This confirms the well-known result
of a similar inquiry made by      one  of our learned Judges.
                COMPARATIVE NUTRITIVE SUBSTANCES.
     A table with a sliding scale, exhibiting the proportionate nu
tritive powers, and intended to answer an indefinite number .of
questions, chiefly for agriculturists, similar to Dr. Wollaston's
table of chemical equivalents, has been issued by Dr. Paris.
According to the common opinion, wheat is placed as a more,
nutritive substance than the oat, probably from its containing a
 large proportion of vegeto-animal matter not in the oat.           We
 believe this arrangement, however, is rather contradicted by ex-,
 perience.     In Derbyshire the labourers in the mines have de
 clared that they could not perform their severe labour at all, or
 at least so well, if fed on wheaten instead of oaten bread ; and it
 has been found by experiment, that a horse, a superior hunter to
 another horse, became inferior by feeding him with wheat, while
 by returning to oats he recovered his superiority.

  that he   has succeeded    in dissolving the celebrated problem of
 perpetual motion, so long regarded as a scientific chimera. The
  piece of mechanism to which he applies his principle Is thus
 described :-i-It is a wheel, around the circumference of which'

there is a certain number of tubes, which alternately radiate or
turn in towards the centre, rendering the moving power at one
time strong, at another weak; but preserving throughout such
an intensity of force, that it is necessary to keep it in check by

                       ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA.
    On the evening of the 1 1th March a very uncommon electrical
phenomenon appeared at Belfast, at intervals, between seven and
eleven o'clock, nearly due west.       Its general shape was that of
a eomet, but much larger, with its tail upwards ; its nucleus
might be about four or five degrees in diameter, and thirty de
grees from the horizon ; but although its shape, size, and inten^
sity of light were constantly varying, its position remained nearly
the same.       It was now and then accompanied by flashes of
lightning. The evening was dark, rainy, and stormy.
    A letter from Corsica of the 3d April says, " For three months
we -have had no rain, and the most incessant and terrible winds
have prevailed. In the middle of March a dreadful conflagration
 appeared in the canton of Venaco ; in less than three hours the
flames had destroyed a surface of more than two leagues of this
fine country.     Fifteen houses were burnt in the village of Poggio.
 It is believed that the cause of this fire was electrical, and that
tires of a similar kind that have happened in other cantons had
 the same origin."             ,
                              LONGITUDE.
    Mr. David Christieson, teacher in Montrose, is said to have,
 discovered an easy and exact method, by which the longitude
 may be ascertained in any part of the world, either by land or
 sea, by means of a meridian altitude of the sun.         It is pointed
 out by a very simple instrument, constructed on mathematical
 principles, aud does not require those tedious calculations from
 solar or lunar tables, by which the ordinary method becomes fre
 quently liable to such uncertainty.      Neither does it depend on
 time-keepers, which, though brought to great perfection, cannot
 be implicitly relied on, especially in long voyages, or where the
 variations of heat and cold may alter the regular motion of these-
 delicate instruments.

stronger wire than     with   you,  in  order  to guard against any exte
rior damage from the awkwardness            of  the workmen ; and to pre
vent the men from opening the lamp, we have also adopted the
expedient of a small padlock, with the key of which the master
miner is intrusted.       The heating of the gauze cloth, however
intense  it  may  be,  is not attended with any danger, for iron the
most incandescent        will  not affect gas ; nothing hut flame will
kindle it. Some attempts have been made to light a mine by
means of its gas, but I am not as yet acquainted with the result.
I should think that such a project must be attended with many
obstacles."                                                           

    On the 21d 1 lh Venus will be in conjunction with the Sun, tha
 planet 2° 22' to the north; but his nearest approach will be on
 the 22d.    She may be seen in this situation with a telescope of
moderate power, provided an additional tube be attached to the end,
 to prevent the direct rays of the sun falling on the object-glass.
    I have ound a tube of paper, blackened on the inside, of about
two feet long, to answer exceedingly well.
    I beg to apologize for an error in the occultation of a1 £ in
your List Magazine, which arose thus : That occultation is one
 of the few noticed by the Nautical Almanac: upon comparing
 my own calculation with         it,
                                   I found a difference of about an
hour; and not doubting but the error must be in mine,             I (too
confidently   it seems)*adopted the numbers there given.        My own
were     3d 10h 17',   3d 10h 42', and which, from an observation
                       I F
    I
of the immersion,        believe were not far from the truth.         It   is
probable that this error in the Nautical Ephemeris             typogra
                                                             is
                                                             a
phical one ;    but surely, as these errors are as likely to mislead
as those of calculation, they require to be as diligently guarded
               am sorry to notice many errors of the same kiud
                                                                       of in

The eclipses of Jupiter's first satellite on the 1st and 15th, and
that of the second on the 16th, were visible, although they were
not marked so.                  Yours, 6»c,

 LXXVIII.              Observations on the Solution
                                                 of Exponential Equa*
       (ions.           By G. A. Walker Ab no-it, Esq. Edinburgh.
                                   To     Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,- Having       lately had occasion to enter upon some alge
 braic problems involving exponential equations, 1 was very much
 surprised at the manner of solution used by most writers on the
 subject; who, instead of finding a direct approximation for the
 purpose, had recourse to what is commonly called The Rule of
 Trial and Error, or Double Position. This may be preferable in
 some, nay in many cases, and then it gives by far the quickest
 mode ; but in others, as in the equation x =a, it gives, after one
 or two trials, an answer by no means so accurate as might be
 desired.    This I ascribe to the confused mixture of parts of
 logarithms with the numbers themselves.
    Thinking, from the mode of solution universally employed,
 that there might be none other known, or at least none so sim
 ple, as that its directness of approximation might compensate
 for the difficulty of solution, I considered that some general for
 mula might            easily be discovered,    by attending        to the nature      of
logarithmic series ; and I was not disappointed in my researches
on this point. It is to the explanation of some of these formula;
that I intend to devote the following pages.
   Under exponential equations, we comprehend those which have
for the index of one of the sides a variable or unknown quantity*
They may all be divided into three classes*    Under the first come
those denned by the formula Zix=er, or where the exponent of
the power only is variable. Under the second class come those
defined by the formula x*             = a, or   i=«, which             is the same   with
x* =       -i-j   in   these both the quantity and its index are Variable
and equal.             The third and last class comes under the formula-
x = ax, where both the quantity and the exponent of its root are
variable and equal.  Besides these many more might be enu
merated, such as x?=^a, the general formula of our second class;
                                            x
also   a   modification of this, xy  a, or x  aX, the equation to
what   i3   called the exponential curve, which   in fact a logarith
                                                              is

 But as these     indeterminate equations, unless
                         are                         be some              y

322                    Observations on the Solution
to comprehend        them at all under my division.           I may remark
besides, that exponential equations are divided into orders, ac
cording to the number of exponents above one another ; thus
                                       XX
xx, a1 are of the first order, x*, a*, are of the second order ; and
so on.      This subdivision was, I believe, first noticed by Ber
noulli.
    As to the first class, or those under the form Jx = a, I have
 nothing new to say, the common mode of solution being quite
sufficient.     I shall therefore point out how it may be obtained,
and take an example in illustration.            Let then J*=a; by taking
the logarithms       of both    sides3   we have    xLbt=La, or x= -^j'
 which gives the common rule.
    Example.      Let 2*= ICO, then       x=    ^= 2|^2 =6'643SG.
    This order of the first class     is far simpler than any     of the other
 orders or classes, as we shall immediately            find.   As for the se-
                                       X
 cond order of this class, or ix = a, that is          x*Li=La,       or  x*=
        it is evident that it copies under the first order of the fol
 lowing class.
    On account of the second class being as it were the key to the
 others, I shall explain the rules of approximation             rather more
 minutely than those of the third. We shall also confine our
attention solely to the first and second orders, and shall explain
 them separately.
     1st. Of those equations under the form xx = a.             These admit
of being converted into an infinite series, which, though not a
fast converging one, yet deserves a place here on account of its
simplicity.      It may be derived as follows :
    Let xx = a, by taking the logarithms,           xLxLa,      or  x= -j 
 Consequently      Lx=L                         \J'x ;   but instead of this
                            ^i^=*L"a
last term, we may substitute the logarithm of the whole of
 h"ah"x, then Lx=I/a L(L"a  h"x) ; and by similar sub
stitutions continually repeated, we get Lx=L"a  L(L*'a  L)
 (L"a L) &c. ad infinitum.            And x is equal to the correspond
 ing   number.      But x admits of being obtained by an infinite
scries without      logarithms: thus xxa, or x=ax,by                substitu-
   * In this   and the following   I  make use of L" to denote the logarithm
of  a logarithm, or llic second logarithm ; L"' to denote the third logarithm ;
 and so on.

     Let x*=a, then              xLx=La;               and let      x=b + y, where        b    is   the
nearest integer or approximate value of x. Hence                               x= b(\        +   j),

powers of the small addition y we have less labour, and nearly

   Before proceeding to the second order of this class,                                  I     may
mention    simple geometrical construction of the equation

Let there be any logarithmic
curve GH, whose logarithms
begin at the given ordinate
AG, which     unit. Produce

                  describe an
equilateral hyperbola KF, be
tween the asymptotes AC
and AD.     Let    cut the logarithmic curve in
                           it                                             F;      then   FE = .fr,
                                                                                               For

                         of Exponential Equations.                 325
For by construction       BD = a, and AD = La, whence AD KG =
 1 xLa;     but by the property of the hyperbola AK;= AE x EF=
%F log. EF = La, whence EF"=a, and EF=x.
    This construction might be shortened by making AD = La,
from a table of logarithms of the same modulus as the above
curve.     But upon the whole, I would prefer the former method.
Were AC less than AG, X and the hyperbolic curve would lie
on the opposite side: but
AC is then liable to a li
mitation, which evidently
happens when the hyper
bola touches the logarith
mic curve. The limitation,
though it shall be found af
terwards by the differential
ealculus, yet admits of a
very simple geometrical in
vestigation.     Let F be the
point   of contact ; then by
completing the construction AC = a, when it is the least possi
ble; draw a tangent MF at F, which must touch both curves at
that point, and also ME be the subtangent.           But it is a prin
ciple of the hyperbola, that the double tangent, or line touching
the hyperbola and lying between the two asymptotes, is bi
sected in F; whence also ME = EA; but since ME is a subtan
gent to the logarithmic curve, and as all these subtangents are
equal, if a tangent were applied at G, AE will be the subtangent or
modulus of the system.         Hence the construction is manifest: for
 we have only to make AE a subtangent to the logarithmic curve,
raise the perpendicular EF, which gives x ; through F between
the asymptotes MA, AG, describe the hyperbola FK; draw then
 GK parallel to AM, and KD to AG; then !3D = a.
    2d. With regard to the second order, one mode may be suffi
cient; I shall therefore choose     the simplest:
    Let  x =a,     to find  x.  Since xx  = a, then x*Lx=La, and
jcLx + L"x = L"a,                                               Lx

second ; and thus the following solution of the second order may
be, shortly though indirectly, obtained.

It   isknown that different bodies, and especially different liquids,
»re dilated by heat     very different proportions.
                          in
   M. Gay Lussac has endeavoured to discover some law which
                                                               For this
might indicate the regulation of these proportions.
                                   the dilatations of different liquids
purpose, in place of comparing
above and   below   one  uniform    temperature, he sets out from a
point, variable as to temperature but uniform as to the cohesion
of particles; from point where every liquid rises into ebullition
                          a
under a given pressure. And among those which he has tried, he
has found two which, setting out from this point, become equally
dilated;  these are alcohol and sulphuret of carbon, which boil,
the former at 78°41, the second at 46°GQ.            Examining then
into the analogies   of these  two  liquids,  M.  Gay  Lussac has dis
covered that they resemble in     this  point   that the jsame volume
                                                                                               of

 339        Analysis of the Labours    of the Royal    Academy
 of each at its boiling temperature gives, under an equal pressure,
 the same volume of vapour ; or in other terms, that the densities
 of their vapours bear the same relation as those of liquids to
 their respective boiling temperatures.
    M, Gay Lussac intends to pursue his experiments, and to pre
 sent very soon more complete researches upon the dilatation of
  liquids and upon their capacity for caloric.
     Among the delicate questions which are at present agitated
  in chemistry, one of the most important respects the proportions
  in which the elements unite in forming different combinations.
  These sorts of researches are subject to great difficulties, be
  cause it is not always possible to obtain insulated combinations
  of gas ; and when it is wished to extract them from the salts of
  which they make part, they are liable to be decomposed or al
  tered by the intermixture of other principles of these salts, or of
  water which almost always presents itself.        It is thus that the
 remarkable differences between the results of Davy, Dalton, and
  Gay Lussac, respecting the combinations of azote and oxygen,
  may be explained.
     From experiments presented this year to the Academy by
  M. Gay Lussac, it appears that nitrous gas contains a volume
 of azote and an equal volume of oxygen without condensation;
 that in certain circumstances it presents a combination of a
 volume of azote with a volume and a half of oxygen; and to this
 M. Gay Lussac has given the name of pernitrous acid {acide
pernitreux) : That ordinary nitrous acid is composed of a
 volume of azote with two volumes of oxygen : lastly, That there
 is in nitric acid a volume of azote and two volumes and a half
 of oxygen.
     Among these different varieties of oxides or acids which hav«
azote for their base, he has found o:ie which is obtained from
the distillation of the neuter nitrate of lead previously dried.      It
 is,
       very volatile liquid
       a                    of an  orange colour.      M. Gay Lussac
 regards   itas nitrous acid, the elements of which are retained     by
the action of water which he supposes makes part of it. But
 M. Dulong has satisfied himself       by very exact analyses that   it
does not contain water   ;   and he calls    for this reason anhydro-
                                            it
nitrous acid (acide nitreux anhydre). The result obtained            by
M. Dulong has been confirmed synthetically.            A  volume of ni
 trous gas, and somewhat more than two volumes of oxygen, sub
mitted to an artificial cold of twenty degrees, give that acid,
which among other properties changes colour not only          by inter

the preceding, of a deep green ; which M, Dulong regards as a
simple mixture of nitrous acid, and another acid in which the
proportion of nitrous gas is much greater.                           ,
      M. Dulong has also investigated the proportions in which
oxygen combines with phosphorus in the formation of acids.
Hitherto only two acids have been recognised, but his researches
have led him to think that four exist.
      The first in which the least of oxygen enters is obtained by
throwing in water an alkaline phosphuret.          The phosphuretted
hydrogen is disengaged, and the oxygen of the water forms with
the remaining phosphorus an acid which continues combined
with the alkali, but which is expelled by sulphuric acid. M. Du
long terms it hypophosphorus, but he believes that its radical is
in part composed of hydrogen.
      A second acid, to which M. Dulong transfers the name of
 phosphorous, is obtained by decomposing water by a combination
 of chlorine and a minimum of phosphorus, a decomposition from
 which two acids result ; viz. hydrochloric or muriatic acid, and
 this which M. Dulong calls phosphorous acid. M. Dulong states
 it to be composed of 100 parts of phosphorus and nearly 75 of
 oxygen.
      The third acid is that which is produced by the slow com
 bustion of phosphorus in air.        It decomposes when saturated
 with phosphoric acid and with phosphorous acid, and gives at
 once phosphites which are more soluble, and phosphates which
 are less so.     M. Dulong does not regard it as a simple mixture,
 but rather as a combination of these two acids, somewhat re
 sembling saline combinations, and in which the phosphorous acid
  serves as a base.     According to that opinion, he proposes to
 name it phosphatic, in order to recall the analogy which it bears
 to the phosphates.
      The last term of oxygenation is phosphoric acid : the propor
  tion of phosphorus to oxygen is here 10Q to 124. It is obtained
  by the quick combustion of phosphorus, or from the decom
  position of water by the chloruret (chlorure) of phosphorus, and
  in many other ways.      It is identically the same with that which
  Is extracted from the bones of animals.

       Three Dutch chemists, Messrs. VanMarum, Deyman,and PaeU
  Van Troostwick, made known in 1796 a gas composed of hydro
  gen and carbon, which they named defiant gas, on account of
   the singular property it possessed of forming an oily liquid by it*
   mixture with oxygenated muriatic gas. According to the theory
   which then prevailed respecting oxygenated muriatic gas, it
   might have been believed that the oxygen united itself to the
    carbonetted hydrogen, and produced thus a sort of oil : but now
    that we have come to regard this gas as a simple body, to which

          '
   332       Analysis of    the Labours   of the Royal Academy
   Sir H. Davy    has given the name      of chlorine, another explana
   tion must   be sought for.      Messrs. Robiquet and Colin have de
   voted themselves to this object.      They have found that by passing
   slowly into  a balloon    a volume  of olefiant gas and two volume*
   of chlorine, they become entirely converted without any residue
   into an oily liquid, which decomposed by heat gives hydrogen
   not saturated with carbon, a deposit of carbon, and a good deal
   of muriatic gas  that is to say, according to the new theorv, hy-i
   drochloric gas.     The chlorine therefore enters in susbtance into
   the oily liquid.    But is it there as chlorine, and united directly
   to the subcarburetted hydrogen ? or, rather, is it there united to
  the hydrogen, and as hydrochloric acid, or in other words mu
  riatic ? It is to the first of these conclusions that Messrs. Robi
   quet and Colin have been led, by indications deduced from the
  specific weight of the components and of the compound : while
  muriatic ether, which has many resemblances to this oily liquid,
  appears to them on the contrary to be formed by the union of
  hydrochloric gas with carburetted hydrogen.
      M. Chevreul continues still to labour with the same zeal in
  his Chemical History of Greasy Bodies.          In a memoir presented
  to the Academy this year, this laborious chemist has begun to
  examine the causes to which the consistency, the odour and the
  particular colour of some oils and fats are owing.       The varieties
 of consistency are regulated by two general principles of greasy
 bodies ; but the other differences depend on particular and fo
 reign principles.      M. Chevreul proposes a system of nomencla
 ture analogous to the rest of chemical nomenclature, as well
 for the principles which he has discovered as for their saline
 combinations.      The two principles of grease ought accordingly
 to be named     steatine   and elaine, from the Greek words which
 signify fat and oil.     Its principal acid, that which Is most con
 sistent, will be margaric acid ; the other, elate acid. Spermaceti
 will take the name of celine, &c. &c. These names are no
 doubt burdensome to the memory, but that is an inconvenience
 inseparable from the progress of science.
                       Mineralogy and Geology.
     Greenland has for several years furnished a stone in small
crystals of a sea-green colour, which has been named sodalite
from its containing nearly a fourth of its weight of soda united
with silex and alumine.
     The Count; Dunin -Borkowsky, a Gallician gentleman and
mineralogist, as zeaIous*as well informed, has discovered a co-.
lourless variety of the same stone in large prisms, in that part
of Vesuvius called Fosso-grande, so celebrated for the number
a,nd variety of the minerals with which it has supplied collectors.

              of Sciences of the Institute of    France.          333
The composition of thh species of the stone, from its great ana
logy to that of glass, might be supposed to be of volcanic origin;
if it were not accompanied with a multitude of other kinds which
have nothing in common with glass; and if the sodalites of
Greenland were not found in places where there is no trace of
subterranean fires.
   The object of geology, in the scientific form which it has at
tained in modern times, is not so much to imagine, as formerly,
systems upon the states through Which the globe has passed, as
to describe exactly its existing state, and the relative position of
the masses which compose its exterior.
   In this last respect these masses have, it is well known, beert
distinguished into primitive,  that       is,
                                         masses in which there are
no traces of organized bodies, and which are supposed anterior
to life,  and into secondary, which are all more or less filled with
organic remains, and which must of course have been formed
since these existed.    These masses are besides generally different
both in point of form and of the materials of which they are
composed.    It  has been even for a long time believed that these
materials are placed in a succession of order equally determined;
so that no such masses as were deposited before the existence of
organic bodies can have been deposited since, and vice versa.
   More correct observations have since shown this idea, as to
the depositation of the strata of the earth, to be quite erroneous^
It has been observed, that between these two sorts of masses
there exist mixtures where the ancient or primitive strata have
been reproduced after new or secondary formations that;      isto say^
some organized bodies which are covered         masses of the same
                                                 by
nature as those which were supposed to have ceased depositing
themselves since life appeared on the globe.      These memorials
of change from one state of things to another have been called
  a
transition earths.
  It   isnot, however, always easy to recognise them as such and  ;
M. Brochant,    ina  memoir which he recently published, had need
of all his sagacity to attach to this intermediate class the greater
part of the valley of Tarentaise  ;   inas much as he had not then
discovered some shells, the existence of which in these rock?, as
since ascertained, has confirmed in    a  most flattering manner the
conjectures   and  the reasonings  of that  learned geologist.
    M. Brochant    has since extended    his  researches on the same
subject, and directed them chiefly     this  year to the ancient gyp
sums which are found in such abundance in certain parts of the
Alps, and of whose enormous masses all travellers who have
crossed Mont-Cenis have taken notice.           After having described
 with  a scrupulous  exactness  all the  circumstances    of their posi
 tion, and having often traversed     the  mountains,    on  the shelves

      <
334            Analysis   of the Labours of the Royal   Academy
ef which they present themselves, the author compares them in
point of composition and situation with transition rocks, and
proves that thev ought not to be ranked in that class.
   The primitive masses themselves are not always easy to cha
racterize : the irregularity of their position, the vastness of the
spaces through which it is sometimes necessary to trace their
relations, and the confounding varieties in their composition,
present great difficulties.   M. Brochant has furnished us with
a striking instance of the mistakes which may be thus occasioned.
After long journeys and laborious examinations, he has discovered
that the lofty summits of the Alps, from Mount-Cenis even to
St. Gothard, and particularly Mont- Blanc, do not consist, as has
been believed, of granite properly so called ; but of a variety more
crystalline, and more abundant of a talcous and feldsparic rock,
which often contains beds of metallic minerals.     He has satisfied
 himself at the same time that real granite pervades the southern
border of the chain ; and, reasoning from analogy, he considers
it very probable that the granitic stratum supports the talcous ;
whence he concludes that the higher summits of the Alps are
not relatively the most ancient part of these mountains.
   It ought always to be remarked, that the ' primordiality of
granite among known rocks is subject to exceptions.            M. de
Buch has ascertained, in Norway, that granites evidently recog
nisable as such are deposited above strata believed to be of a
more modern class, and even strata containing petrifactions.
Trie same thing has been observed in Saxony, and even in Cau
casus.
   M.     de   Bonnard  whohas had the honour of giving to geology
the first complete description of the Ertzgeburge  of that pro
vince of Saxony which is in a manner the country of geology 
has endeavoured in that work to determine those places where
granite is inferior, and those where it is superior to other strata.
It cannot be doubted, after the researches he has made, that the
granite of Dohna cannot be in this last situation, as the Saxon
geologists have announced ; but in other places, and especially
near Freyberg, there is every reason to believe in the superiority
of the granite.     It further appears from his observations, that
the chain which separates Saxony from Bohemia is distinguished
by also having granite on one side, and that the southern.
    The work of M. de Bonnard contains many other valuable de
tails upon the nature and position of the strata of this celebrated
province, and also on the rich metallic veins which everywhere
traverse       it,
             and on which the industry of the people has been so
long  exercised.   In these respects     equally interesting to geo
                                        it   is

Very gteat service, by his work on Mineral Wealth.         The first
volume, which related to the administration of the mines, printed
in 1S10, has been a long time known and appreciated.            The
second, in which he treats of the working of them, has been pre
sented in manuscript to the Academy.          The author has here
added to all the theoretical directions which science affords, a
great quantity of practical facts collected by him in his travels,
and in the exercise of his functions; so that every precept is in a
manner supported by a real example.            A magnificent atlas
which accompanies the work presents all that can be exhibited
of these examples to the eye.
    The discovery so important in geology, made by MM. Brong-
niart and Cuvier, of certain stony beds which contain only land
and fresh-water shells, and which cannot of course have been
formed by the sea like other shelly beds,  has led to a number of
researches in all parts of Europe.        M. Beudant, professor at
 Marseilles, has this year considered this matter in a new light.
As in some places fresh-water shells have been found mingledjwith
 marine shells, he has endeavoured to ascertain by experiment,
how long the molluscs of fresh water may be habituated to live
in salt water, and vice versa with respect to marine molluscae.
 He has found that all these animals die quickly when the change
is sudden and entire ; but when the saltness of the water is gra
dually increased for the one, and gradually diminished for the
other, they become for the most part habituated to live in a water
which is not natural to them. Some species, however, resist all
conciliation, and cannot suffer any variation in the water which
they inhabit.
    M. Marcel deSerres has communicated the sequel of his first re
searches on fresh-water shells, of which an account was given in
the analysis of the Academy for 1813.      The principal fact which
he has made known this year, is a formation of this sort, which
 he regards as newer than any other, and which he has discovered
in seven different places in the neighbourhood of Montpelier.
His observations are somewhat similar to those of M. Beudarit'.'
 He distinguishes the species in the environs of Montpelier, int$ ,
those which do not appear to be able to live except in fresh wa
ter ; those which can subsist in briny waters not exceeding a
 maximum of 275; and lastly, those to which marine waters
appear necessary.      He has by this means explained some very
singular mixtures of these organic remains.
    The stratum which he describes is in a manner composed of two
layers inclosing different shells.  The superior one contains both
 land and aquatic shells.   The new formation appears principally
on the higher parts of the hills or ridges.      A great many land
                                                               shells

shells and impressions of vegetables have been found there, pet--
fectly similar to the species which exist on the superincumbent
soil at present.
   While in Europe the principles of geological observation are
thus evolved, some zealous naturalists have been applying them
                                                                     to
to countries more remote, and have found Nature ever faithful
the same laws.
   The great labours of M. Humboldt on the structure and ele
vation of the respective mountains of the two Americas are well
known, this learned traveller has presented a prelude to a
work which promises to be not less important, in a table of re
sults obtained in India, on the height of different peaks of that
immense chain known to the ancients by the name of Imaus,
and to which the Indians have ascribed the principal facts of
their mythology.
   According to the trigonometrical measurements of Mr. Webb,
an English engineer, four of these peaks are more elevated than
Chimborazo ; and one of them, the highest mountain known at
present on the globe, is 4013 toises or 7821 metres ; and
                                                                  even
according to other calculations   4201  toises  or  8187  metres.
    M. Humboldt makes in his memoir a happy use of the laws
of vegetable geography, in order to supply the heights of certain
ridges which it has not yet been found practicable to ascertain
by actual measurement.       When a particular plant grows in any
place of a ridge, he    determines  by the latitude what height the
ridge cannot exceed.
    Within a space more limited M. Moreau de Jonnes, corre
spondent of the Academy, has also made some very useful ob
servations.     He has presented to the Academy a geological chart
of   a part  of Martinique, on which are marked with great care
the heights of the mountains and hills, and principally of an ex
tinct volcano which appears to have given birth to these in
 equalities.
    The author has extended his researches to a great part of the
Antilles. The elevated centres of these islands consist of vol
 canic peaks which are named mornes ; the tufts of lava with
 which they are overrun are called barres; and the denomination
 of plainiers is used to designate the shelves (plateaux) which
they have formed in their descent.
   The islands where there is only one peak and one system of
eruption, such as Saba, Neva St. Vincent, are the smallest,
and in an agricultural respect the least important.      They have no
good ports, because     s th ports are  nothing    but the extremities
of the valleys left between two or more systems ; such as we see
iii Guadaloupe, Martinique, Dominica, St. Lucia, Grenada, &c.
 Martinique in particular appears to owe its origin to six volcanic
                                                                   £

buted. It is the exact topography and mineralogy of one of
these six, that of Mont Pelle, which M. de Jonnes has given us.
 He believes that volcanic nature so general, that he supposes it
serves even as a base to those of the Antilles, which present no
thing but a calcareous exterior manifestly shelly, such as Bar-
badoes and the high land of Guadaloupe.              Guadaloupe pro
perly so called is formed of four systems of eruption, one of
which, the Soiifriere, still maintains some degree of activity. M.de
Jonnes has also given a very accurate description of it in a ge
neral statistical view of the island.
                                 Botany.
    One of the most important branches of botany, and which
more than any other connects it with the great body of physical
sciences, is vegetable geography, or the laws of the distribution
of plants according to the height of the pole, the elevation of
the soil, the temperature, and degree of humidity or dryness of
the climate.
    M. Humboldt, whose travels have contributed so much to the
progress of this as well as other branches of knowledge, has given
nearly a complete treatise on it under the title of Prolegomena de
Distrilutione geographica Plantarum secundumCceli Temperiem
et Altitudinem Montium,           In this work he presents some pro
found researches on the distribution of heat, both relatively to
the positions of places and to the seasons of the year; for not
only the lines under which the same mean annual degree of heat
prerails are far from being parallel to the equator, but places
which have upon the whole an equal mean heat have their sum
mers and winters by no means alike. All these differences must,
it is conceived, have a strong influence on the propagation of
plants.    The author afterwards proceeds to the differences which
result from elevation, and which are not regulated by the same
laws in all places : and he at last arrives at a consideration al
together new,  that of the laws of the distribution of vegetable
forms.      By comparing in each country the number of plants of
 certain families well determined, with the total number of vege
tables, he has found a striking regularity of numerical coinci
dence.      Certain sorts become more common in- proportion as
we advance towards the pole ; others, on the contrary, increase
 towards the equator ; while some attain their maximum in the
 temperate zone, and are equally diminished by too much heat and
too much cold. And, which is very remarkable, this distribution
 remains the same all over the globe, by following not the geo
 graphic parallels, but what M. Humboldt calls isothermal pa
 rallels, that is to say, lines of the same mean heat.     So constant

both of the total number       of vegetables and    of the number of
species in each of the other families.
   'The Prolegomena to which we allude are placed at the head
of the great work which M. Humboldt is at present publishing
with Messrs. Bonpland and Kunth, upon the new plants which
he has discovered in equinoctial America.         This addition, the

 and among the palmce    alone  twenty-three new   species.    Messrs'*
 Humboldt and Bonpland have published         at  the  same  time   the
 conclusion of their description of the Mclastoma, a work      of most
 magnificent exterior, but which could not be imitated throughout
 the whole range of vegetables, without incurring an expense and
 delay as prejudicial to science as to its cultivators.
    M. de Beauvois, whose perseverance is also deserving of every
 praise, has published this year the fourteenth and fifteenth parts
 of his Flore d'Owareet de Benin; and, not satisfied with his
 ancient collections, he has taken advantage of the extraordinary
 humidity of this year to pursue his investigation into the class of
  Fvngi. The continual rains have so developed this class, that
 he has discovered many species which have escaped preceding
 botanists.   Such are  a variety of sclerolium which has lessened
 nearly by two-thirds the crop of kidney beans, upon which it
 propagates itself;
                     a new species of spheria, which has been very
 destructive to  onions;  also a new species of cereda, which has
 been still more pernicious to them ; and lastly, which is very
 remarkable, a new genus of parasitic plant which grows upon
 other parasites, and injures very considerably the vegetables
 which are obliged to nourish both.
    The family of the dipsacei, such as the scabious, are, it is well
 known, very nearly allied to composites by many of the cha
 racters of their flowers and their fruits ;  the most apparent
 mark which distinguishes them        is,
                                       that the anthers are entirely
 free.   Botanists have discovered some plants whose flowers are
 equally formed of many smaller flowers, the anthers of which are
 united at the bottom only.      It has been found doubtful what
 place to assign  them.    M.  Henri  de Cassini, who has examined
 them at the close of his great work on the class of Syngenesia or
  Composilce, has found that they differ from these  because their
 anthers are not united at the top, because their style and stigma
                                                                     are

at the top of the cavity of the oveary. From the dypsaci, again,
they differ in having their anthers united at the bottom, and in
the alternation of their leaves.        Most of their other characters,
however, they possess in common with these two elasses.            M. de
Cassini has hence been led to think that a distinct family might
be formed, which would serve in place of two others; arid this he
h;is designated by the name of Boopideesi             These will compre
hend the genera calycera de cavanilles, boopis and lacicarpha of
M. de Jussieu.
    We announced last year the opinion of M. Deeandolle upon
that pernicious substance called ergot, which shows itself in the
cars of rye and some other grainsj especially in wet seasons.
In the course of the year 1S16, M. Virey has made some re
searches, which lead him to regard ergot as a degenerescence of
grain, and not as a fungus of the genus sclerotium, as M. Deean
dolle believes.       He says he has observed ergotized grains which
had not only preserved their natural form, but in which one might
still see remains of stigmas ; and he cites the assertion of
M.Tessierj that many ears of grain have been observed which
were only half-ergotized, and that equally towards the top as to
wards the bottom *
    M, Vauquelin has made on this occasion a comparative ana*
lysis of sound rye, of the ergot of rye, and of a sclerotium per
fectly recognised as such.         In the ergot he found neither starch
nor gluten in their natural state, but a mucous substance and a
vegeto-animal        matter, abundant and inclining to putrefaction.
It contains a fixed oil quite developed. The principles of scle-
totium are altogether different.         Without being decisive, these
experiments have led some persons to doubt with M. Virey
 whether ergot be of the tribe of fungi.

     Animals have also their geography: for Nature in like manner
 retains every species within certain limits, by lines more or less
 analogous to those which restrict the extension of vegetables.
     Zimmermann has already given, upon the distribution of qua
 drupeds, a work which is of some celebrity.
     Latreille has since published one upon that of insects.         Dif
 ferences of    from  ten to twelve  degrees  of latitude produce  always
 at an equal height particular insects; and when the difference
 reaches to from twenty to twenty-four degrees, nearly all the in
 sects are different. Analogous changes have been observed cor
                                                                         -

 340          Analysis   of the Labours of the Royal Academy
 each    ; and the species even of those which are common to both,
  present very perceptible differences. The insects of the countries
  which surround the Mediterranean, those of the Black and Ca
  spian Seas, and those also of a great part of Africa, present a
  great similarity.      These countries form particularly the region
  of the coleoplcra.       America presents us, besides the genera pe
  culiar to itself, with a great number of herbivorous insects, such
  as the chrysomela, the cassida, the papilio, &c.            Those of Asia
  beyond     the  Indus  possess  a  great affinity in  respect of the fa
  milies and genera of which they make a part.               The species of
  New Holland, although neighbours to those of the Moluccas, are
  distinguished by some essential characteristics.          The isles of the
  South Sea and of South America seem, to indicate in this respect
  some general affinities,       although the entomology of Africa is
  directly    contrasted  in many points with that of South America.
      In the west of Europe the prevalence of meridional insects
  becomes very manifest, when, going from north to south, we ar
  rive at those countries which are favourable to the culture of
  the olive.      The presence of the scorpion announces this re
  markable change of temperature ; but in North America the
  same change does not take place until about five or six degrees
  of latitude nearer the equator.        The form of the new continent
  and the nature of its soil and climate are the causes of this dif
  ference.
      M. Latreille presents us in the sequel with a new division of
  the earth by Climates.        Greenland, although very close to Ame
  rica, appears, according to Otho Fabricius, rather to ally itself in
  this respect to the north and west of Europe.           It may still, how
  ever, be considered as an intermedial land between the two worlds.
  Adopting this view, M. Latreille takes it as the point of depar
  ture of a first meridian, which, passing 34° to the west of that of
  Paris, extends into the Atlantic Ocean, and terminates at the
  Sandwich Islands in 60° south lat., being the ne plus ultra of our
  discoveries towards the antarctic pole.          This meridian, from 84°
  north lat., the last approximative boundary of vegetation, to 64°
  south lat., is divided at every twelve degrees by circles parallel to
  the equator. The intervals form so many climates, which M. La
  treille designates by the names of polar, subpolar, superior, inter
  medial, surtropical, tropical, and equatorial.         M. Latreille next
  divides the two hemispheres by another meridian, which he fixes
  at 180' to the east of that of Paris, and then separates each
  continent into two great parts by means of two other meridians ;
  the one 62° more easterly than that of Paris, and touching on
  the western limits of the Indian Sea; the other intersecting
  America at 1(50° to the west of the meridian of Paris, and de»
, taching the part of that continent which geographically,          and also

two zones, eastern and western.
    The attention of all Paris has been recently directed to a wo
man from the Cape of Good Hope, who has been exhibited to
the public under the name of the Hottentot Venus.            She be
longed to a nation in the interior of Africa celebrated among the
colonists of the Cape for their ferocity.      The shortness of their
stature, and especially the enormous projection of the buttocks in
the woman, seem to mark them out as a race quite distinct from
the Negroes and Caffres by whom they are surrounded.            Much
has been also said of the aprons of these females.          By earlier
travellers they have been represented very inaccurately, and more
recent ones have ventured even to deny their existence.
    The individual alluded to having died at Paris, M. Cuvier had
occasion to dissect her, and to establish the particularities of her
organization.      She possessed the apron: but this was neither an
overfolding of the skin of the belly, nor a particular organ ; but
a considerable protrusion of the superior part of the nymphs,
which fell before the opening of the matrice and covered it en
tirely. The prominences of the buttocks consisted of a cellular
tissue filled with fat similar to the bumps of the camel and dro
 medary.     The head displayed a singular mixture of the charac
 teristics of the Negro and the Calmuck ; and the bones of the
 arms, remarkable for their slenderness, presented some remote
 affinities to those of certain species of the monkey tribe.
    One of the most formidable of the venomous tribe next to the
 rattle- snake is the yellow viper, or fer-de-lance of Martinique
 and St. Lucia, upon which M. Moreau de Jonnes has communi
 cated a very interesting memoir to the Academy.            Naturalists
 place it at present among the genus trigonocephali.        It abounds
 in all the principal colonies of France.        Some pretend that it
 was originally transported there out of hatred to the Carribs, by
  a people on the borders of the Oroonoko ; a tradition which may
  perhaps explain why it remains a stranger to the rest of the
  Antilles. From the borders of the sea to the summit of the
  mountains the inhabitants are exposed to its attacks ; but its
  principal retreat is in the fields of sugar-cane, where the great
  abundance of rats affords it a plentiful subsistence, and where it
  propagates with an increase proportioned to the number of its
  young, of which it has generally from fifteen to sixteen at a birth.
                                                    Attempts have been
  made, but in vain, to destroy these vipers by means of terrier
   dogs, of English breed.      M. Jonnes proposes to employ against
                                   '
  them the bird    of  prey called messager or secretaire (falco ser-

     M. Cuvier has finished by a memoir Sur le Poulpe, le Seiche,
 et le Calmar, the work which he undertook a long time since
 upon the anatomy of the molluscce.          The genera which have
 been now mentioned are the most remarkable in this numerous
 class of animals for complication       and singularity of structure.
 Provided with three hearts, with a nervous system very developed,
 with large eyes as well formed as those of any vertebral animal,
 with excretory viscera formed on a plan of which Nature offers
 i)o other example-  they merit every attention from naturalists.
     In making these anatomical researches M. Cuvier has had
 occasion to discover the nature of a fossil common enough in.
 calcareous beds, and which has hitherto been quite an enigma
 to geologists.     It is a bony fragment, concave on one side and
 convex on the other, with a border radiated, and a ridge (Spine)
 between the convexity and the border.        It is now demonstrated
 that this is the inferior extremity of a bone of the seiche (Se-
pia L.) ; and if there is any thing to be astonished at, it   is, that    a
 resemblance so evident has not been sooner discovered.

 M. Marcel de Serres has ascertained that         it  one of the valves

of regular bivalvular shell, the hinge of which has certain pe
    a
culiar characteristics.      He has in consequence formed         a new
genus of     it,
               which he has named acanthis.        The animal of this
shell has not yet been observed.
    The animals without vertebre, considered in general      in  regard
to the classification and enumeration of the species, form the
subject of    a large work, of which M. de Lamarck has published
the three first volumes, commencing with the microscopic ani
mals, and extending to the tribe of insects.         In treating of the
molluscce, he introduces         anew class which he calls tuniciers,
formed of those composite molluscce of which M. Savignv has
given so singular    a   history, as also of those simple molluscce
which are analogous to those which enter into the formation of

  by a variety of experiments, which afford many important diete
  tic indications, and cannot fail to be of considerable use to me
  dical science *.
      M. Majendie has also made, in common with M. Chevreul,
  some experiments to determine the nature of the gas which de
  velops itself at the moment of digestion in the different parts of
 the elementary canal.        In four criminals who had taken, a little
 before their execution, certain fixed viands, the stomach presented
 oxygen, carbonic acid, pure hydrogen and azote,  the small
 intestine the three latter gases but no oxygen ;  in the great in
 testine there appeared, in conjunction with the carbonic acid and
 azote, carburetted and sulphuretted hydrogen gases. The two
 last pertained therefore only to the great intestines : oxygen is
 found only in the stomach ; azote and carbonic acid exist
 throughout the whole canal, and the quantity of the last increases
 as the aliment descends.

     Ignorance in medicine is never more dangerous than, when
called in to enlighten justice, it leads it astray by inconsiderate
assumptions, which draw down upon innocence the shame and
the punishment reserved for guilt. A work which M. Chaussier
has published on Legal Medicine  the object of which is to con
centrate the lights afforded by anatomy, chemistry, and physio
logy, for determining the causes of death  is on this account of a
truly social interest. To the general rules which he prescribes,
he adds, as examples, many judicial reports of remarkable cases;
with his own remarks on the omissions, the errors, the obscu
rities, the fallacies which are too often to be met with in these
important documents.          The whole of this part answers com

    The author, however, has not limited himself to what is pro
mised in his title.      He has also directed his attention to many
faults in the ordinary manner of opening dead bodies  faults which
have often led to false conclusions on the nature and the seat of
diseases.     And physiology generally will be much benefited by
the great number of acute remarks on functions too little at
tended to, which this learned physiologist has interspersed through
his work.

  as in all the intermediate climates,  during epochs of victory the
  most brilliant and prosperous, as well as in defeats the most ca
  lamitous,  in situations of deprivation the most absolute. No
  variety of occasion has he wanted, and he has profited by them
   all. To those results of his experience which he has already
  recorded in various public works, he has added this year some
   important observations upon the effects of foreign bodies intro
   duced into the lungs, and the operations employed to remove
   them.     When the collection of pus or of blood has forced the
   lungs to contract, the expulsion of these matters occasions a
   void in the thorax, which Nature endeavours to fill up either by
   the production of new matter, or by detaching matter from the
   sides and other neighbouring parts.         M. Larrey has been able
   to exhibit these changes by the dissection of individuals who, after
   being cured, had fallen victims to other fatalities.     He has also
   been the first to fix the opinion of practicians, as to the possibi
   lity of the ampiitafJon of the thigh at its superior articulation, by
   presenting an actual case of such amputation followed with per
   fect recovery, and making known the mode by which it may be
   performed with safety.

    as a substitute the fur of the sea otter, and also that of the native
    otter.   It is true that hats wholly composed of such a material
v
    would be dearer even than those made of beaver ; but consider
    able profit will be found by overlaying, or as the hatters call it
    gilding, hats with this fur, the bodies of which are formed of more
    common stuff:  in the same manner, in short, as has already
    been long the practice with beaver.

    By M. Le Chevalier Delambre, Perpetual Secretary.
    "  Never, perhaps," says the learned analyzer of this depart
ment,    "  was the zeal of geometricians better sustained  never
have they devoted themselves with more constancy to their ac
customed labours, to the development of their first ideas, to the
completion of works already published ; and yet never have we
found greater difficulty in giving the history of this branch of the
annual labours of the Academy."               After a statement of sorae
obstacles arising from the private arrangements of the Academy,
"  the more," it is added, " mathematics have advanced, the more
difficult their ulterior progress has become, the more impracti
cable it is found to render sensible and striking the results newly
obtained." It will not therefore, it is hoped, excite surprise, that
in the present analysis little more than the titles of some valu
able works should be indicated, nor (if we may be allowed to
supply the parallel implied, but not expressed, by the learned se
 cretary) that in entering more at large into other works, a suc
cessive exposition of the contents of each should be preferred to any
attempt to give a condensed and systematic view of the whole.
     The length, however, to which on these accounts the ana
 lysis of this branch of the labours of the Academy extends (eighty
pages quarto), is a disadvantage which, we regret, precludes the
practicability of transferring it to our pages, as we have done that
 of the preceding department.           Not a few of the articles indeed,
 particularly those of M. Laplace, Mr. Farey, &c. have already been
 fully noticed in the Philosophical Magazine ; and opportunities
 will afterwards be taken to make our readers acquainted from
 time to time with such others as merit, but have not yet been
 under, their observation.
     The article of Mr. Farey's to which we have just alluded, and
 to which the ingenious secretary refers with no more than the
 respect which it merits, appeared originally in the Philosophical
  Magazine, vol. xlvii. p. 385, and refers to a curious property of
  vulgar fractions, which Mr. Farey was the first to discover and
  communicate to the world *.
     * My ingenious
                       correspondent Mr. Farey, referring to this subject in a
 letter which  I lately received from him, writes as follows:
     " still entertain hopes, that some English Mathematician will turn his
       I
  attention to the demonstration of the properties of complete fractional
  Series: your Correspondent S. A. in p. 204 of vol. xlviii. has failed entirely,
  and reasoned in a circle: he first forms arithmetical progressions, which
  he could not find in any Series, and then shows, that the inseparable
  property of arithmetical progressions attends such series, of his own
  forming.   I wish likewise, that some of those fond of contemplating Musical
  Ratios and Intervals, would consider the complete Harmonic Series XVII,
  XV, XII, X, VIII, VI, V, 4,    III and 1, whose ratios are given in p. 385.

 LXXX.        On the Ratio which exists betwixt live Velocities of
     Bodies in motion, in Fluids; and the Power required to main
     tain such Velocities.
                              To   Mr.    Tilloch.
 Sir,      In The    Philosophical Magazine for March last (p. 200,)
 a number of queries occur, and upon the second of these I take
 the liberty of offering some short remarks.
     Mr. George Rennie states, that " it has been found that the
 tatio of resistance (of bodies moving in fluids) being as the squares
of the velocities does not maintain ; or in other words, that a
 quadruple power will not produce a double effect or velocity."
     The first part of this sentence does not, I apprehend, admit
 of the construction implied in the latter ; the resistance being
 no measure of the power, unless the circumstances of time and
space are taken into consideration along with it. A quadruple
 power will doubtless produce not only a double, but a quadruple
 effect ; but this effect, so far from producing a double velocity ;
 ought only to increase it in the proportion of about 10 to 16,
or more correctly as 3 t/ I to 3 y' 4 ; being as the cube roots of
the power : as I shall endeavour to explain.
     It is ascertained from the experiments of Burt and others, that
the resistance is very nearly as the squares of the velocity; or, for
example, that if a body A, immersed in water, be put in motion
by means of a cord passing over a pulley, and having weights
suspended therefrom ; these weights will produce velocities in A
proportional to their square roots.             Now let the body A, and
consequently the weight, move at the rate of 1 foot per second,
and let the weight capable of producing this be = 1 lb.               The
power     then is equal   to 1 lb.  falling through  one  foot per second.
But let A now be required to move at the rate of 2 feet per se
cond ; the resistance being quadrupled, the weight will require
to be increased in like ratio and equal 4 lbs. and this weight will
now descend at the rate of 2 feet per second, and the power is
therefore equal to 4 lbs. falling through 2 feet per second, or
eight times what was required in the first case.
    It is therefore obvious, that if the resistance is as the square
of the velocity, the power required to overcome that resistance
must be, as that resistance involved into the velocity, or as the
cube of the velocity.

 M     y object in describing this instrument is to facilitate, if pos
 sible, in some degree the method of finding the longitude by a
 lunar distance, principally for the use of the masters of our mer
 chant-ships, by abridging the calculations.
     T do not offer the instrument as complete and perfeet ; it re
 quires a greater number of observat^ns than is desirable, and it
 self is not very simple. As, however, it will most probably receive
 successive improvements and ultimately assume a more conve
 nient form, and hast he principle is rater new, it may not be to
 tally unworthy the attention of the mariner. The principle is this :

 zon, ZM/nO a vertical circle passing through the true and ap
 parent place of the moon; ZsSQ another vertical circle passing
 through those of the star ; MS is their true and ms their appa
 rent distance : let hqo represent a circle in the plane of the ho
 rizon, ZPO, zhq, circles in the planes of ZMmO 'and ZfSQ;
join MC, mP, SC, S/> : the diameter ho must be supposed eva
 nescent compared with HO, .: P, p and C must be supposed
 coincident. An observer at C will perceive the objects at M
 and S ; but if a prism be placed at P which elevates any ob
ject seen through it in the direction ZPO, the angle of deviation
equal MPm, and another depressing vertically placed at p, hav
ing an angle of deviation equal SpS, the rays which reach the
 observer's eye will be PC, pC, proceeding from the real places
 M and S, a sextant would then measure their true distance,
 and its plane would be held in the plane MPpS passing through
the observer's eye, and their true, and not wiPpS their appa
 rent places.     It is now very easy to perceive that if two qua-
 drantal arcs be fixed upon the frame of a sextant capable of
 moving upon axes which always meet in the centres of these arcs,
 such arc having a prism of a proper angle of deviation, the re
 fraction taking place in the plane of this arc, the rays from the
 moon passing through one prism, and those from the star
 through the other ; by placing the axes of these arcs in such a
position that the angle between them shall equal the true di
 stance known within a few minutes from the longitude by ac
 count and estimated from the Nautical Almanac, then elevating
 the arcs till from the point of intersection the arcs measured to
 the plane of the instrument equal the true altitudes of the ob

jects, a distance taken with this sextant will be cleared by ob
 servation.
      Fig. 2, represents the addition to a common sextant; A the in
 dex mirror ; B the horizon glass ; NO the telescope ; GLM is a
 circle having B for its centre ; QPG is a quadrantal arc attached
 to the tube FG, whose axis is the axis of motion of this arc. This
 tube is fixed to another, D, placed before the horizon glass by a
 brass frame CEF ; at D within the tube is fixed a prism, its re
 fraction taking place in the plane of the arc QPG: the prism has
 such a shape that only the reflected rays can pass through it.
 At G is another prism for the star, whose refraction is in the
 same plane, but in the opposite direction.           HK is another arc
 capable of being carried round the circle by an index below, and
 moving upon a joint K, the direction of the axis being a line
 joining K and B.
      In taking an observation with this instrument, take the alti
 tudes of the objects; at the expiration of about five minutes, take
  them again ; from the change of altitude their real altitudes will
  be known at the end of the next five minutes, Which will allow
  sufficient time to make every preparation.         Knowing the longi
  tude by account, we can ascertain the true distance between the
  moon and star within a few minutes, which is sufficiently near
  for our purpose. Move the index bearing HK, till the arc KG equal
  true distance known nearly.          Elevate the two quadrantal arcs,
  till from the point of intersection R the arc RK, and from the
  same point RG, shall equal the true altitudes of the moon and
  star respectively, at the expiration of the second five minutes.
  Then at the end of this time measure the distance, which will be
  the real one ; for since KG = MS the true distance nearly, RK =
  ZM= moon's true altitude, and RG = ZS= the star's true al
  titude; the spherical triangle KRG = ZMS=sPp, .: aline joining
  R and B if produced would pass through the zenith when the two
  objects are brought into contact, .: RG and RK will be two ver
  tical circles, and the prisms will elevate and depress vertically.
  
       In order to adapt the instrument to all possible values of the
   quantity of refraction and parallax, it may be accomj>anied with
  a number of prisms having different angles, and which will bring
  the object nearest to its true place ; and finding the difference
  between the apparent distance and the distance thus cor
  rected by direct :: ascertain the true distance.         Thus let SM
   /fig. 4)  be the  true  distances ;  sm  the apparent ; let the prism
  bring    the objects  into  the position S'M', when Mm and iS are
  very small ; MM' : M't : : M'm : mt' . This will, however, only
  be an approximation to the truth, which will seldom deviate so
   far as to introduce an error of importance.
                                                                 A  more

              of the Moon's Distance from      the Sun, &c.       349
    A more correct use of the prisms is this : let them be capable
of being inclined to the rays which fall upon them ; then the
angle of deviation may be changed, by which means a number
of prisms will not be required. The best method of applying
the prisms is to make use of two compound ones ; let AB, BC
 (fig. 5) represent two prisms, the base of one joining the vertex
of the other   ; let DE be the ray incident upon AB, on leaving
the prism, its direction would be FGK, but after passing into
the other prism, is elevated, taking the direction HL ; by varying
the angle ABC, or by inclining both the prisms differently to the
incident ray, the real angle of deviation LMD may =o, and from
o increase to any required quantity.        This latter method does
not require that the prisms be ground to any particular angle,
for any two prisms having very small vertical angles, equal or
unequal, may be used.
     With respect to the circle GLM, if it be divided so far that
three or four minutes may be read off, it will be sufficiently ac
curate, and in the arcs HK and QPG the degree may be divided
into six equal parts ; each very distinctly visible through a lens
of one inch focal distance, and greater accuracy than this is not
essential.
     Having only described the principle of the instrument, I pur
pose in a future Number of this Magazine, to describe the me
chanism minutely, and investigate the different formulae required j
also to ascertain the error in distance arising from any given error
in the computed distance, or altitudes.
              Description of the Reflecting    Goniometer.
    This little instrument   was   first invented  for the purpose of
measuring the angles of the prisms adapted to the sextant which
I have just described; being in some respects more, convenient,
and certainly capable of measuring an angle with a greater degree
of precision than most goniometers at present in use, it may not
perhaps be unacceptable to the mineralogist.
     ABC (fig. 3) represents a graduated brass circle ; in its cen
tre is placed a plain mirror D at right angles to the plane of the
circle, capable of being turned round by a nut below the instru
ment ; HK is an index carrying a vernier ; at a right angle to
this is fixed a brass pillar at a right angle, to which is attached a
small spring tube G, through which passes a rod of brass, having
a plate of brass E, fixed at one extremity, and a milled nut at
the other F.
    The application is obvious ; the mirror is adjusted, as in a
Hadley's sextant ; the crystal is attached to the plate E, by a
                                                                 little

little gum, the vernier     is brought to zero, and the nut F turned
round till two adjacent       faces of the crystal are at right angle to
the plane of the circle     j   the mirror D is then turned round till
on viewing any object by reflection, the image reflected by one
face of the crystal is coincident with that reflected by the mirror ;
then the mirror and one face of the Crystal are parallel ; the
index (which of course carries with it the crystal) is next to be
moved, till another face of the crytal is brought parallel to the
mirror ; the angle through which the index has been moved is
the supplement of the angle of the crystal.
    The advantages of this instrument are these s 1st, since when
the plane of the mirror and one face of the crystal are parallel,
the two reflected images will be coincident, in what position so
ever the eye be placed ; the goniometer may be held in the hand
when in use.        2d, As both the mirror and the crystal may be
adjusted    with  the  utmost precision, and the coincidence of the
 two images accurately observed ; the angle may              be  measured
very minutely.       3d, It is very portable.

There       is scarcely a single operation of Nature that has been
 explained in such a manner as to meet with general approbation.
 Electricity, combustion, respiration, animal heat, fixed caloric,
 radiation of cold, composition of water, and various other objects
 of physical inquiry, are supposed by philosophers in general to
 be clearly explained; but conclusions in direct opposition to those
 have been advanced by others.             Now it is evident that either
 one or both of these explanations are erroneous, and therefore
 terrestrial physics cannot be ranked with the sciences.
     VVhen an erroneous hypothesis is recorded in books of science
 and taught by the most learned professors, few will be inclined
 to doubt of its truth. But the first step to knowledge is to doubt.
 He who never doubts never examines.                 And without examina
 tion erroneous opinions may be handed down from one genera
 tion to another, if not detected by what is called chance.
     Let us' not, therefore, follow those who, from habit, indolence,
 or the fear of singularity, are the determined supporters of old
 established opinions ; but examine those opinions with due eare,
 and then mark the progress of future discoveries.
     In the investigation of problems in terrestrial physics, it is ne
 cessary to observe, that there are certain invisible, imponderable,
                                                                untangible

                 New Outlines   of Chemical Philosophy.           35 1
tmtangible elements in matter, which are only known to us by
the effects which they produce.
    There are two modes or ways of investigating physical pro
blems.      Some are investigated by experiment only; but in others
experiment and observation are the data we have to reason from.
As examples of the first kind of investigation, let two experi
ments be taken from electricity.
    It has long been a disputed point among electricians, whether
glass be permeable by the electric fluid, and whether electricity
by induction be permanent.
    To investigate these problems by a single experiment, I took
 the Florence flask described in a former paper*, and suspended
 it by a short brass chain from the ceiling of a room.      When the
electricity of the earth was very strong, I took a glass tube about
3-4ths of an inch in diameter and two feet long ; and after having
 excited it by a silk rubber, I held it under the flask at the di
stance of about two feet : the gold-leaves within the flask in
 stantly began to show signs of electricity; and on gradually car
 rying the tube up towards the flask, the divergency of the leaves
 increased.
    When the tube was brought to the distance of about nine
 inches from the flask, the leaves diverged to an angle of sixty
 degrees, and continued electrified for fourteen days. The tube
 was not in this experiment brought nearer the flask than nine
 inches.     This experiment shows by mere inspection, that the
 electrical element met with very little obstruction in its passage
 through thin glass ; and that electricity by position or induction
 is permanent.
     In making delicate experiments on electricity, it is necessary
 to attend to the electricity of the earth ; for, if that state of the
 earth had been very weak at the time when the above experi
 ment was made, a very different conclusion might have been
  drawn.
     But in reasoning on experiments and observations, in deducing
  general conclusions from them, it is of the utmost importance
  to observe :
      1. That all the circumstances or natural things concerned in
  the experiment be accurately known, and taken into the investi
  gation  ; and,
     2. That no hypothetical opinion      be taken for granted.
     In the experiment to show the decomposition of water, there
  are three things concerned in it ; that is to say, the two electri
  cal elements,  thermogen the element of heat, photogen tbe ele
  ment of light and water.      These being the only circumstances
                   * Phil. Mag.    \\vl p. 210. Exp. 10.
                                                             concerned

  352           New Outlines     of Chemical Philosophy.
  concerned   in the experiment,      it remains to show how the two
  gases are formed.
     The three circumstances contained in this experiment admit
  only of two combinations, as the elements in this instance do
  not combine  for where they do they cease to act on matter.
  Hence thermogen and water form oxygen .gas, photogen and
  water form hydrogen         gas water being the only gravitating
  matter.
     But suppose for a moment that water were a compound of
  oxygen and hydrogen, then the circumstances or natural things
  would be 4, and their combinations 2x2 = 4. Thermogen and
  photogen being united to the supposed component parts of water,
  each combination would produce a new compound ; thus,
     Thermogen combined with the oxygen of the water, would
, form a compound (a).         Thermogen combined with the hydro
  gen of the water would form another compound (I) .         Photogen
  combined with the oxygen of the water would form a third com
  pound (c) . And photogen combined with the hydrogen of the
  water would form a fourth compound (d).
     But in the experiment of the decomposition of water, we have
  only two compounds, oxygen and hydrogen gases ; consequently
  the supposition is erroneous.
     In the decomposition of water there can be no more than
  three circumstances concerned in the experiment to produce the
  two gases ; therefore, if water be a compound of oxygen and
  hydrogen, the electric fluid (as it is called) is a simple element :
  but if the electric fluid be composed of two elements, then it fol
  lows that water is a simple body.
     Now, as it has been proved by the most satisfactory experi
  ments that the electric fluid is composed of two invisible ele
  ments*, water is unquestionably a simple body, and the only
  ponderable base of the two gases.
     This is not a new conclusion; but it is derived from principles
  very different from those made use of by Dr. Priestley and other
  eminent philosophers.       Dr. Priestley proved by several chemical
  experiments, that water is a simple body, and supported the
  opinion that it is the only ponderable base of oxygen and hy
  drogen gases and other aerial fluids.
     The supposed discovery that water is a compound body, re
  ceived its chief support from the following experiment.     M. Ber-
  thollet and his associates burned together fifteen grains of in
  flammable air and eighty-five of vital air, and obtained exactly
  one hundred grains of water ; in which by decomposition they
  found again the same principles, and in the same proportion.

    Now this very experiment proves that water contains nothing
 that is combustible; for of all combustible bodies when burned
 with some substance containing the element of heat (oxygen), the
 inflammable matter is converted into light, the oxygen into heat*
 and what remains at the end of the process is an incombustible
 substance.    Had the water been a compound of two gases perfectly
 combustible, according to the French doctrine, they would have
 been wholly converted into light and heat, and no water would
 have remained ; or, had any part of the water been combustible^
 the weight of the water remaining at the end of the experiment
 would have been so much less than the weight of the two gases*
 And the two elements of combustion, being imponderable, add
 nothing to the weight of the two gases ; and hence the reason
 that the weight of the water found at the end of the experiment
 was exactly equal to the weight of the two gases.
    Since light, heat, and an incombustible substance are1 pro
duced by burning together the two gases, it is necessary that
combustion should be investigated before the composition of
water, can be understood from this experiment.
    The learned translator of Hatty's Treatise on Natural Philo
sophy* observes, that " the subject of combustion is a very dif
ficult one, respecting which opinions are still afloat ; the theoryi
of the eminent yet unfortunate Lavoisier, though adopted by
Haiiy, and indeed by the generality of chemists, both continental
and English, is far from satisfactory."
    And after giving some account of the theories of M. Lavoisief
and Dr. Thomson, he further observes: " still it must be acknow
ledged that this is a very obscure subject ; the reader would,
therefore, do well, before he forms a decisive opinion, to trace
the progressive improvement of the theory in the hands of Boyle,
Hooke, Mayow, Beccher, Stahl, Scheele, Kirwan, Black, Craw
ford, Lavoisier, Brugnatelli, and Thomson, with a view to which
he may advantageously consult the article Combustion in Dr.
Gregory's Encyclopaedia, and in the Supplement to the Encyclo
pedia Britannica; Robison's Life of Dr. Black; the Edinburgh
Review, No. 5 ; Nicholson's Journal, N. S. vol. ii ; Nicholson's
Chemistry; and Thomson's Chemistryf."                 Hence it appears
that the F             cademicians were totally unacquainted with
combustion, when they made their experiments from which they
deduced the conclusion, that water is a compound body.
    As the term phlogiston has occasioned much controversy^ it
may be necessary to remember what has been stated in a former
        J
paper ; that the imponderable element of hydrogen gas of La
voisier, the phlogiston of Stahl, Scheele, and Priestley; the ne^

  gative electricity of Franklin, and the element of light, or pho-
   togen, are only different names for the same thing.
        And the fire-air of Scheele, the dephlogisticated air of Priest
   ley, and the oxygen gas of Lavoisier, are only different names
   for the same gas ; the elementary or imponderable part of which
   is the same as the positive electricity of Franklin, and the ele
   ment of heat, or thermogen.
        That one of these is the element of light, and the other the
   element of heat, may be demonstrated thus : The gas procured
   from coals, with which the streets of large towns are now illu
   minated, contains the element of light. . This element produces
   a most brilliant light with very little heat, as it consumes only
   a small quantity of the oxygen gas of the air.          That the oxygen
   gas of the atmosphere contains the element of heat, may be
   clearly understood from the use of the blowpipe.              This instru
   ment produces the most intense heat, without increasing the
   light of the lamp ; and the same effect is produced by other
   blowing machines used to increase the heat of furnaces.
        Scheele observes in his Treatise on air and fire*, that " phlo
   giston is a true element and a simple principle, which enters
   into so close and subtle an union with empyreal or fire-air that
   it even penetrates through the most subtle pores of all bodies.
   From this union arise both the matter of light, and likewise the
  matter of heat f.        In all these compositions phlogiston under
  goes    not  the least change ; and from the last composition it can
  be separated again.        Phlogiston can by no means be obtained
  by itself; for it never separates from one body, though united
  with it ever so closely, unless there be present another coming
  in immediate contact with it."
        Hence the term phlogiston, which has been so much animad
  verted upon by chemical philosophers, is only another name for
  that inflammable element contained in a certain class of bodies,
  and this 's perhaps as proper a name as any other that has yet
  been invented.

                               To  Mr. Tilloch.
 Sir,       A correspondent           in your Number for November last
 has     proposed some inquiries       respecting the most ceconomical
      * Page 108.        + The elements of light and heat are very different
 from the matter of light and the mailer of heat.    This very important sub

construction     of  an oven for baking, &c. and an apparatus for
heating liquids     and drying substances by steam.      Having had a
simple,   and  by no means expensive, culinary stove for more than
a year in constant use in my own kitchen, which was constructed
without a knowledge of or reference to any other of a similar
kind, is Very ceconomical with respect to fuel, and unites great
convenience and cleanliness with extent of application, I have
thought a description of it may be worthy of your notice.             It
has been adopted by several of my neighbours, who have expressed
themselves much pleased with it ; and though the description does
not completely solve the inquiries suggested, it may be useful to
your correspondent, or others who may choose to make trial of
one of a similar construction.
    It is extremely probable that something similar to the appa
ratus I am about to describe may have been employed by others;
but the skilful direction of heat from a small quantity of fire to
our various culinary and domestic purposes is by no means ge
nerally understood ; and notwithstanding the exertions of Count
Rumford and others, the attention of men of science to this in
teresting and useful subject will most probably be still repaid with
valuable improvements.         I venture to hope, therefore, that the
present communication will not be without its use in contributing
to improve our domestic ueconomy, and diminishing that waste
ful consumption of fuel unavoidable in conducting culinary and
domestic processes by an open fire.
    The stove which I am now to submit to your notice projects
in front of the ordinary fire-place, which has been built up, the
necessary communications with the chimney being preserved.
    The fire-place of the stove is built of bricks ; it is nine inches
long in the grate, six inches wide, and seven inches deep. The
grate is situated four inches and a half from the door, and the
interval is covered with a plate of iron.        The front of the stove
as far as the side wall of an oven on the right is covered with a
plate of sheet-iron 1 -8th of an inch thick, in which the door
ways are cut, and which is secured by stays walled into the brick
work. Over the top of this fire-place a cast-iron plate is laid
twenty inches square and 3-Sths of an inch thick.
     From the top of thisfire-place a flue for the passage of the heated
iair passes under the oven, then up the side furthest from the fire
till it reaches the top, whence it descends down the back of the
oven to the bottom of the side next to the fire, and is continued
up that side, and then along the top to the centre, where its
escape into the chimney is regulated by a sliding register.
     The width of the flue round the oven should be about three
inches in the part under the oven, and two inches and a half up
the side furthest from the fire ; the space   '     at the back of the
                                    Z 2                             oven,

556         Description of an (Economical culinary    S/wi.
oven, which serves for the descent of the hot air, should also be
about two inches and a half wide, and likewise that part by which
the hot air ascends, seeking its way to the chimney.       The other
dimension, or the depth of the flue, depends on the size of the
oven, the flue being of the whole depth of the oven excepting
only the thickness of the brick-work in front, which should not
exceed three inches, that the quantity of surface exposed to the
hot air may be as little reduced as possible.
     The oven which I have adopted is about fourteen inches wide,
twelve high, and sixteen deep from front to back, which will be
 found convenient dimensions for moderate families.
     Moveable stoppers are inserted in the brick-work for the con
 venience of cleaning the flue  one of these, placed at the back
 corner parallel to the bottom of the oven and top of the fire
 place, serves for sweeping out the flue at the bottom, at the
 back of the oven, and up the side next the fire-place; another at
 the front bottom corner, furthest from the fire-place, serves for
 cleaning the ascending flue furthest from the fire ; and a third in
 front over the door of the oven for cleaning the top part of the flue.
 A door, closed with sheet-iron, opens into the chim ney, over the
 fire-place, for sending up a sweep to clean the chimney.
     At the distance of about three feet over the stove, there is a
 horizontal frame of wood about four feet long by twenty inches
 wide, having wires or strings from end to end, three or four
 inches apart, for drying linen, &c. This frame, by means of a pair
 of hinges, may be turned back against the wall when not in use.
     By this simple apparatus, the various processes of boiling,
steaming, roasting, baking, &c. can be conducted on an extensive
scale with the greatest ease and in the most cleanly manner, with
 a quantity of fuel so small as to be scarcely credited by those
 accustomed only to open fires, and with what are called small-
coals, which can be purchased here at about two-thirds of the
price of the mixed or large and small together.         The same fire
which heats the cast-iron plate sufficiently for boiling, steaming,
 Sic., at the same time heats the oven for roasting or baking.
     The kitchen is completely warmed in the coldest weather, and
can be readily ventilated in summer.        Linen, &c. is dried and
 aired with great rapidity, and flats are heated for ironing.     The
 oven being constantly hot is found useful for various purposes, and
when not otherwise wanted, is kept open, or shut, as more or less
 heat in the kitchen is required.      On its top, plates and dishes
 are warmed for the table, or liquids may be kept at a moderate
heat for any length of time.        When the fire is not wanted, it
may be kept in for several hours, by nearly, closing the registers,
with very little consumption of fuel, and may be blown up in a
tew minutes by opening them.

            Description  of an csConomical culinary Stove.       357
    Boiling, steaming, and frying, are conducted on the cast-iron
 plate over the fire-place.  One of the size above described, twenty
 niches square, is large enough for most moderate families; for,
 when a vessel is made to boil by being placed on the hottest
 part, it may be removed to one side, where it will keep boiling
i'or any length of time ; and another which is required to boil
 may be substituted in its place.
    In families where large quantities of hot water are wanted, a
 boiler may be set on one side of the cast-iron plate and an oven
 on the .other,  but this wiil not in general be found necessary.
    Persons accustomed to place their vessels over the irregular
 surface of an open fire, or on the hooks and other contrivances
 made use of to support them, will be surprised at the great steadi
 ness and cleanliness with which the process of boiling is con
 ducted on an iron plate.
    Steaming may be conducted immediately over the vessels of
boiling water, or in others at a distance ; or the steam, confined
 between the sides of double metallic vessels of various forms,
 may be applied to the purposes of warming water, drying, &c.
    The bottoms of vessels used for boiling on an iron plate should
 be perfectly flat ; and both these, and those used for steaming,
 should have their sides and tops kept as bright as possible.
    The boiling temperature in liquids, except the plate be very
 hot, is tiot obtained quite so soon as over an open fire ; but this
will be found productive of little or no inconvenience, as the
 vessel has only to be placed on it somewhat earlier.
    The common frying-pan may be used over an iron plate ; but
one with deeper sides would be preferable, to prevent the flying
over of any particles of fat, which should be carefully avoided,
 both on the plate and in the oven.
    Bread may be toasted by being cut with a smooth surface, and ,
placed on a small wire frame laid on the iron plate, so close as
just to prevent its contact.    Small pieces may also be toasted in
the fire place, and steaks, &c. may be readily broiled therein, on
 a gridiron adapted to its form and size.
    Cheese may be toasted with much greater facility than before
a fire, by being placed on the stove in a common plate, and
turned once over.
    That roasting can be well conducted in an oven, is by no means
generally known. The difference between it and baking is this,
that the latter process is performed, as your correspondent sug
gests, with the door closed ; and the former, with it sufficiently
open to admit of a gentle current of air passing constantly
through the oven : and as in every oven, when the door is open,
a current of cold air enters near the bottom, and, passing round
up the back, returns out highly heated under its top, it is neces-
                                  Z 3                           sary

 sary to place the meat in this upper current of air. The oven door
 may he kept quite shut till the meat is warmed through, and be
 gins to roast ; and then should be opened about the width of one-
 eighth of an inch in front, or wider if the processs goes on too
 rapidly. The meat should be turned and dripped occasionally ; and
 generally requires about one-third more time than when roasted
 before a fire; from which, however, when the process is conducted
 with moderate care, it cannot be distinguished by the nicest taste.
    As the lower current of air tends to preserve the dripping-pan
 cool, placing it in another containing water, as described by
 Count Rumford, will not be found necessary after a little prac
 tice in regulating the heat of the oven by the registers.
     It is obvious that one of Count Rumford's roasters, or roasting
 ovens, may be heated by the flue from the fire-place, as well as
 a common cast-iron oven ; but as the former in particular are
 much more expensive, more complex, and less durable and as
 the process of roasting can be conducted in the highest perfec
 tion in a common cast-iron oven, this, in families where cheap
 ness and simplicity are kept in view, will obtain the preference.
    The oven might be constructed of sheet-iron at a trifling ex
pense, and would never be liable to injury from the fire, at the
 distance at which it is placed. Even an old cast-iron pot, placed
 sideways, with a wooden stopper, would make no contemptible
 oven ; and with a cast-iron plate, a fire-place door, and a few
bars, a stove might be cheaply constructed in those situations of
life where comfort and ceconomy are more particularly desirable.
    As the temperature of the oven can be varied at pleasure, by
urging the fire more or less, by keeping its door shut or open,
and in the latter case by placing the article to be subjected to the
effects of heat higher or lower, it forms of itself a small drying
stove ; and when in addition to it the iron plate on its top, and
that over the fire-place, are taken into consideration, it is obvious
that any degree of temperature up to red heat can be always ob
tained ; and in the current of warm air immediately over the
stove, when drying at a lower temperature is required, it can be
conducted with great case, and on a more extensive scale.
    It will be observed, that the fire-place is not situated immedi
ately under the centre of the iron-plate, but at the distance of
about nine inches from its left-hand edge, which, allowing six
inches for the width of the fire-place, leaves about five inches in
the clear between it and the side-wall of the oven. The object of
thus placing it towards the oven      is, that too much of the heat
may not      be expended under the plate, but that a due share of  it
may be distributed around the oven.
  It    may, however, be placed immediately under the centre of
the plate, in which case the entrance from the fire-place into the.
                                                                 first

               Description  of an ceoonomical culinary Stove.       359
   first flue (which in the present construction is over the upright
   side of the fire-place) should be made sloping upwards from near
   its bottom.
       It will be found convenient to have a strip of iron plate, three
   or four inches wide, riveted to the right-hand edge of the cast-
   iron plate, and turned up at a right angle against the side of the
   oven-flue, as the mortar is liable to crack with the strong heat,
   and to be struck off by the culinary vessels.
       Once in three or four days a little straw, or a few shavings or
   sticks of brush-wood, should be kindled in the fire-place, and
  suffered to burn freely for a few minutes with the dampers open,
  to clear the flues of soot, which would otherwise collect and im
  pede the passage of the smoke. With this precaution, the stop
  pers, which are left for cleaning them, will only require to be
  withdrawn once in a quarter of a year or longer, to remove the
  ashes of the soot, which is readily done with a brush having a
  flexible wire handle.
       If at any time, for want of burning out, the flues should get so
  full of soot as to impede the current of the smoke, which only
  happens from inattention, it may be easily broken down by intro
  ducing the brush, and then burnt, without the trouble of sweeping
  it out.
      The high price of what are called the steam kitchens, their
 complex structure, and the frequent repairs some of them stand
 in need of, together with the difficulty of heating boilers, ovens,
  &c. (economically , from an open fire, even were the flues which
 surround their sides constructed in the most advantageous man
 ner, are objections to their general adoption ; not to mention the
 smoke, soot, and dust of open fires, and the more extensive ap
 plication to the purposes of drj ing and warming of which a stove
 is capable.
      I fear I may have trespassed on the patience of some of your
 readers by descending too much into detail on a humble subject ;
but I trust to their candour for excuse, when it is considered that
 my observations are ultimately for the use of persons in the
 humbler situations of life ; that our culinary processes are, even at
 this enlightened period, commonly conducted with scarcely more
 skill in the application of heat, than they were by our aboriginal
 ancestors ; that individuals accustomed always to open fires are
 likely at first to experience occasional embarrassment in the di
 rection of its unseen energies in a more artificial manner ; and
 that the highest speculations of science, however gratifying to
our vanity, are comparatively of little value till they are made
subservient to our necessities,       I am, sir,
                                     Your obedient servant,

             On the
   the Advantages   of a Set of Symbols or Characters, by which
   the mutual Relations of the principal ones can be expressed, in
   the form of simple Equations:  with a Table.
                                      By Mr. John Farey, Sen.
                               To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,     In  Plate V of volume xxviii. of The Philosophical Maga
 zine for 1807, the first attempt was made, with which I am ac
 quainted, at collecting together in any publication, all the most
 essential Musical Intervals; accurately defining these by means
 of their Ratios and Logarithms, and assigning to each a Symbol
or Character, by the help of which their mutual relations might
be shown in a great variety of ways, in simple Equations* ; and
by means of which Symbols the values of all other Musical Inter
vals might in like manner be accurately expressed.
    Since this period, the publication of The Rev. Henry Liston's
 " Essay on perfect Intonation," for explaining the principles and
 use of his Euharmonic Organ, has served to greatly extend
and methodize our knowledge of Intervals ; and my occasional
hours of leisure or relaxation, have since been devoted to an in
quiry, into the values of all the Intervals within an Octave, which
can arise, in the 3422 combinations, by pairs, of which Mr. Lis
ton's 59 Notes and their Octaves, are capable.
   The extended and complete Table of Mr. Liston's Intervals
thus formed, is found to contain 220 different Notes, two of
which are found repeated 52 timest, two others 47 times, two
others 45 times, each (all of these being Concords) and others
in lesser degrees of repetition, down to 12 other Intervals, which
are each found only once, in comparing every two of Mr. Liston's
Notes, and their Octaves, as already mentioned.
    In searching for the principles of Nomenclature, by which all
these, and even a still greater variety of musical Intervals may be
each correctly named, I have found, that fifteen other Intervals,

now be necessary, each to be furnished with its Nume and Sym

former Symbols, which had been adopted from the late Mr. Over-

to the common letter-press Printing : and likewise that several
of these Intervals, whose Names were selected or given by Mr.
Overend, should now be changed, for others, better adapted to
classification, and a general Nomenclature.
   All these additions and corrections, I have included in a Table
to accompany this (see pages 360 and 361).        The first column
of this Table contains the Symbols distinguishing the Intervals,
whose Names follow, in column 2.
   In column 3, the values of the Intervals are given, in the new
Notation which I had the pleasure of first presenting to the Public,
in p. 1 40 of your xxviiith volume : the terms of this notation are,
the Sckisma 2, lesser Fraction* f, and Most Minute m, in the
former engraved Tablef ; and each expression in this column,
coupled with the symbol in the first column forms a simple
Equation, thus, y=92 + m, lV=3012 + 6 f +26m, &c.
    Column 4, shows the indices of the powers of the musical
 Primes 2, 3 and 5, composing the Ratios; the negative signs (  )
therein, indicating reciprocals, or the denominators of the Frac
tions, which follow in column 5 ; thus, in the 5 th, 6        2  la

indicates    the fraction                  = -tt   :   &c.
     The reciprocal Logarithms in column                 (I,   are placed lowest, and
are the complements of the Logarithms to                          1   ;    they denote the
same Interval, reckoned downwards, as the                         Logarithms do            up
wards; the first    figures of the logs, are pointed off, conform
                       7
ably to the common    Tables of logarithms.
   The Corrections in the second page of the Table (page 361),
are, think, sufficiently explained therein, except the compound

     It will be seen   inthe second page of the TaMe now sent, that      pro           I
pose to change the Name, of this smallest -hut -one of known Intervals,
to subminimum Residual; because the class of Fractions, as wish now to       I
constitute  it,has always   anegative sign to the    therein. Instead of mine

utmost varieties.

willbe seen, that the number of f 's found in the notation of the
several Numerals, are as follows, viz.
                    II(2f), 3(3f), III(4f), 4(5f),
     1(0), 1(f), 2(f),                                                    IV(6f),
5(6f), V(7f), 6(8f), ,VI(9f), 7(10f), Vll(llf),                               8(1   If),

                        8,

Interval E* Gb, being equal 672 + + 6m,        f        either + 2g, or

 like manner, his Interval Dbc, = 555E-f- lf-f-48m,    1             either

                                     is
the Minor-comma-defective          minor Eighth, &c.
     In all the other number of      f   's,
                                           only one Numeral should, or
indeed can with propriety be used, in naming the Interval, to
 which such number of           's
                                f  belong.
     It will now be proper to consider the classification of the smaller
tabular Intervals, which can, according to the principles of No
 menclature now under explanation, be used as above, as prefixes
 to the Numerals, in naming Euharmonic Intervals             these are ten
                                                                :'
 in number, viz. 2(1), y(9), g(10), c(U), t>(12), e(21),
             f(32), A (43), and E(53)              :
     These ten Intervals being, without any            in their notation,
                                                       f
 they belong to        particular class of Intervals, all of which might
                        a
 have received the general name of Comma,              if  had been prac
                                                           it
 ticable, to find     sufficient number of prefixes, for distinguishing
                        a
 between these various Commas; but this not being the case,
 the expedient has been adopted, of dividing this class into Fa-                           v
  milies, and calling five of the larger of these Intervals Diesis,
 instead of Comma.
     Thus, we now have in the Tables, the enharmonic s(2l), the
  minor 0(31), the major /(32), the greater a (43), and the maxi
  mum E(53), as prefixes to the family term Diesis               and which
                                                                     ;
  compounds,      or  even   their doubles,  triples, &c. may   themselves
  also be made prefixes, to any of the Numerals, when so required,
  in the naming of particular Intervals.
      For an example, Mr.Liston's Interval D* F'b, = 892                8m,
                                                                         +f    -f
is    either   2   f,
                   + or + 2=; and may either be named, the Major-
                            I
  diesis-excessive minor Second, or, the Double-enharmonic-diesis-
  excessive major First; and so of others.
            ...                                                                       As

366            Oft the Nomenclature   of Musical Intervals.
    As prefixes to the term Comma, when it is retained as a family
 Name, we now have in the Tables, the lesser y (9), the minor g
 (10), the major c (1 1), and the maximum ..(12); which com
pounds, or their doubles^ triples, &e. may themselves also be em
ployed, as prefixes to the Numerals.
   Thus,for example, Mr. L's Interval C *      = 2892 + 6f+ 25m,
is either IV       or 52
                    i),        and may either bear the name of, the
                               c,
 Maximum-comina-defective       major Fourth, or, the Double-com-
ma-deficient minor Fifth and so of others.
                               ;
   The remaining and least Interval of this family, which has been
mentioned, might, in order to carry on the analogy,- have been
called the minimum Comma 2(1); and in like manner also,m (0)
might have been called the subminimum Comma; but               have
                                                                  I

the new Notation, with compound Names, instead of their pre
sent simple ones, of Schisma and Minute.

   The whole class of Tones (or major Seconds) thus defined                by
means of their two f's, includes, in fact, numerous family of other
                                               a
Intervals besides the four which are so named in my Tables       of    ;
these we have one other example in the Table (having no m)j
viz- M, *5S4-2f; which is=T 9c, or              9c, and maybe

called, either the Nine-comma-deficient major Tone,oi the Nine-
comma-deficient major Second.
   The entire class of Semitones thus defined, as containing
each o?ief   in its new Notation,     is   by
                                          no means confined to the
six which   are so  named in the Tables, with the prefixes maxi
mum, major, medius, minor, minimis, and subminimis         and two
                                                             ;

intermediate ones, P(58), and L(46), which are left with their
former simple names, Apotome and Limma, for want of more
prefixes than are above enumerated.
    But there is in the Tables another family of smaller Semitones,
which for convenience are named Hypkroche, of which there is
the majors (15), the mtdius D (14), and the minor p (10).
   And a family of still smaller such Semitones, named Residual,
having no m, with the several prefixes, greater ]R (5 ?) *, major
 T(5), Liston's C(4), medius ;£ (3), minor r(2), and submi-
nimum f (0) : and to which the Minimum 2(1) would have
been added, but from my desire, to avoid'loading this very im
portant Interval, with compound names, which is already so well
known by the simple name of Schisma.
    A principle, on which all the numerous family of Residuals
 {of the class of Semitones, but in ivhich. no m's enter) seems to be
 deducible, from considering certain of the larger of the Commas
 and smaller of the Diesises, as quarter Tones ; and two of these
 to be equivalent, to one of certain of the Semitones respectively ;
 analogously to the modes in which I have shewn in p. 366, that
 Commas may be derived from Semitones and Tones; but this is
 a subject on which I must not at present enlarge, except to give
 such Equations, for the several Residuals in the Tables, viz.
 5L-43i-2i=f,          Si-L   = S,         3L-2
                                             Si-2e = r, 2 L-g>
-2    e=x,    L-2s    =  C,   fe-2  e=r, and 5         L-3 £-4e=K-
    It remains now to mention, only one other class of Intervals,
 in my Tables, and which are called Fractions, wherein f is
 negative.      Three of these have the prefixes, medius d (1 ?),
 greater  F  (1 ?) and major R (6).
    I have never found leisure, and probably never may, for de
 ducing anv general principle, on which these and the numerous
 other Fractions in my large MS. Tables of Intervals, may all be
 derived. My Table of Mr. Liston's 220 Intervals (which I hope
 at some time to be able to publish) contains no example of this
 class of Intervals called Fractions, which occasions them to be of
 far less consequence, in my estimation.

 LXXXVI.        Summary of Meteorological Observations           made dl
                     Paris during the Year 1816*.
 The      thermometer which is kept at the Royal Observatory is
 exposed to the north, at about eight metres (24 feet) above the
 ground, and in a wooden ease around which the air circulate!
 freely.    The graduation has been verified by that of an excellent
 instrument constructed by M. Gay Lussac himself, with all the
 precaution necessary to secure the utmost exactness.             The de
 grees have in all our tables been reduced to those of the centi
 grade scale.
     It appears to result from the recent researches of M. Hum
 boldt, that in all climates we may, without the risk of any sen
 sible error, take as the mean temperature of every day, the mean
                                      '
 of the extreme temperatures.           The minimum being observed at
 sunrise, the maximum about three o'clock P.M., the half of the
 sum of the indications of the thermometer at these two periods,
 for all the days of each month, will furnish the numbers which
 express the mean temperatures of the twelve months of the year.
 In the table which follows, we have placed the results of 1815 by
 the side of those of 1816.          It will be seen from these, that in
 regard    of temperature,    these two   years differ much less than we
 might    have  been  led  to  suppose.    The extremes of the thermo
 meter in 1816 have been : + 28* July 20th, and  1°,8 Feb.llth.
            Temperature     of the Vaults of the    Observatory.
    The observation of the thermometer, in subterranean situ
 ations, has acquired great interest, since geometricians have de
monstrated, that at a sufficient depth the temperature, under
 every latitude, ought, abstracting accidental causes, to be the
mean of the temperatures of the surface.            A glance at the fol
lowing table will show, that at 28 metres (85 feet) under the
ground (which is precisely the depth of the vaults of the Obser
vatory) the diurnal and even the annual variations of the ther
 mometer are altogether imperceptible.
    At Paris, the mean of the temperatures of the surface does
not appear to surpass 10° 6', that of the vaults is 12°          T : it is
 difficult to assign the cause of so great a difference.
                                Hygrometer.
    Our hygrometer has been constructed by Richer : it is placed
in the shade, and towards the north.           In the subjoined table we
have only noted the observations made at three o'clock P. M.,
which, making allowance for accidental circumstances, is every
day the period of the greate»t dryness.              On referring to the

separate tables, it will be observed with surprise, that in this
year so remarkably rainy, the hygrometer fell nevertheless so low
as 34° in April, the term of saturation being 100°.             M. Ramond
informs us, in his work, that he never saw, even on the Pyrenees,
the hygrometer below 39°, except under very rare circumstances.
                             Quantity    of Rain.
    The rain     is collected at the Observatory in a cylindrical reci
pient    placed on the platform of the building at 30 metres
 (90 feet) above the ground.            It passes from that into a tin
vase, which is closed on all sides, and where it cannot experi
ence any sensible variation : and care is besides taken to mea
sure it a short time after it has fallen.
    From the average of eight yeafs of observations, (since 1809,)
the annual quantity of rain at Paris appears to have been 48'46
centimetres (17 inches 11 lines). The result of this year (1816) is
equal to 54-54 centimetres (20 inches 2 lines). That of 1815 was
Only 45-07 centimetres (16 inches 8 lines). The rain collected in
 1811 exceeded by 4*4 centimetres (I inch 7 lines) what has
fallen during the year just elapsed ; and nevertheless the number
of rainy days in 181 1 was only 143, while in 1816 there have been
no less than 167.
    It would appeal- from some experiments made in England,
that the quantity of rain is more or less considerable in propor->
tion as the gauge in which it is received is elevated above the
ground.        The new instruments with which the Observatory has
been lately enriched will enable us, in the course of the ensuing
year, to appreciate the amount, and perhaps to assign the cause
of these differences.

370 Summary of Meteorological Observations at Paris in lStGi
                              Barometer.
   The determination of the mean pressure of the atmosphere
on every place of the earth is the most important object to be
attained by the observation of barometrical variations.       In oc
cupying ourselves with this inquiry we have followed the course
which M. Ramond has traced in the excellent work which he
pvrblished   in 1811.    All the heights have been corrected by the
effect of the temperature, and reduced to zero by employing
j-^-j- as the coefficient of the dilatation corresponding to a de
gree centigrade.       The observations made at the same hours
have been collected in vertical columns, and the averages rec
koned by decades and by months.          From these calculations it
appears, as M. Ramond has already deduced from his observa
tions at Clermont, that the barometer is subject in our climates
as well as at the equator to a periodical daily oscillation, the
operation of which, though often masked by accidental varia
tions, becomes manifest when a sufficient number of observations
are combined to compensate the fortuitous effects of disturbing
causes.     It has also been found that the mercury attains its
greatest height at nine o'clock A.M. and that it continues after
wards descending until three o'clock P.M.; when it remounts and
attains its second maximum at nine or ten o'clock at night, af
ter which it redescends to repeat the following day the same
course of fluctuation.     If we might be permitted to reckon from
the observations of one year the exact compensation of accidental
causes, it would seem to result from the averages of the different
hours exhibited in the subjoined table, that the diurnal oscillation
diminishes in proportion as the latitude increases. Thus under
the equator the extent of this sort of atmospheric tide reaches
to two millimetres, according to the researches of Humboldt ;
and three years of observations at Clermont-Ferrand (lat. 45° 47')
rhake it only about one millimetre ; while at Paris it has not
altogether exceeded seven-tenths of a millimetre.       Ulterior ob
servations will, perhaps, settle this point : those of which we
have here given a summary prove already, that the heights cor
responding to the different hours of the day differ sufficiently
the one from the other, to show that the thing, as M. Ramond
has remarked when proposing to determine the mean pressure
of the atmosphere in a given place, cannot be arbitrary.

      LXXXVIL         On Chain Bridges.        By A Correspondent;
 The       proposed bridge at Runcorn having greatly excited the
 attention of the public, and the consideration of mathematical
 and mechanical men, who seem to differ considerably as to the
 principles as well as the construction of a chain bridge ; for the
 information of persons immediately interested, and those who
 have curiosity and ability to prosecute these inquiries, 1 have
 collected into one point of view all the essential parts of this
 difficult subject, by which calculations may be made, and with
 out which no project of this kind, however plausible, ought to
 be entertained.
     It is too evident to need demonstration, that if a chain con
sisting of a number of connected links be suspended by one of
its extremities, the lowest link will suffer the least strain, the
next link will be drawn by its own weight, and that immediately

greater than that at o, and greatest of all at the points of suspen
sion.  Hence we learn, that to make the strength of the chain
in proportion to the stress, which reason and science require, its
dimensions must vary from the lowest point o to P.          This in
crease in size and weight will change the curve from a catena
rian to one of a more complex and transcendental nature, which
none but the most transcendent abilities will be able to develop.
We therefore must content ourselves with the approximate know
ledge derived from considering the chain of invariable dimensions,
which is a problem of difficulty and labour, as is well known to
mathematicians ; and none other need attempt it.         I shall not
give  the elementary investigation by  which    the following equa
tions and a knowledge of the subject can be derived ; it may be
seen in the authors before quoted, some of whom have given ex-i
amples of numerical calculation, which may be useful to those
who have not laboured much in the difficult parts of science, but
may be desirous of ascertaining the results of the present or
some future project of this nature, putting a to denote the stress
or strain at the lowest point o ; Go=x; GQ=y; and Qo=z,
The following are the general equations alluded to :
   1st,   y =     x
                  a     hyp. log.                             ax    hyp. log.               ,

   2d,     xV2ax+x\
    3d,   x= a + V a1 + z*i   from which, if any two of the quanti
ties be given, the rest may be found. But it is evident, from the
transcendental nature of the curve, that this can only be done in
the present form, by the tedious method of trial and error, a mode
of operation not suited to common calculators.        To obviate this
difficulty in some degree, Dr. Hutton,     at p. 33 of  his Principles
 of Bridges, has reduced the first equation into the following series :
   o=i*       x   -g-   +  *     -^        +
                                               ^-
few terms," he says, "are sufficient to determine the value of
                                                                         ,&c.    V   where   a

pretty nearly."  Perhaps the above series will be better adapted
tp calculations,           by   substituting   t>==   ?   and reducing the fractional
coefficients of the series into decimals.                   Thus a=\yv      v* +

   Having now the value of a, the stress at the lowest point o of
the curve ; the distance of the points of suspension ; the length,
weight, and swag of the chain, &c; the tangent QC, and sub-
tangent GC, become known from the equations
                         QC= JL(o +           ar):   GC=
(see Emerson's Fluxions, page 205), whence (by Bridge's Me
chanics, page 302), as 2CG is to CQ, so is the whole weight of
the chain, &c. to the pressure of the point P or Q, or, as                             is to
*
    (a\+ x),     so is   2z to a + x.         Hence it appears that the stress at
a the lowest point is to that at suspension, as a to a + x !
   As a denotes the tension exerted at the lowest point by a
weight equivalent to a feet in length of the chain and the weight
appended ; the pressure at P will be equal to a weight of the
bridge of cr + GO in length.
   Thus we ultimately obtain the stress at o, and pressure at the
points of suspension, and the strength of the chain necessary to
support the whole bridge and its appendages, and its ability to
resist every strain that may occur from loaded carriages, or other
fortuitous causes.   These, likewise, are subjects not of conjecture,
but of equally rigorous and difficult calculation.  As the particular
dimensions and circumstances are not yet given, it is unnecessary
to introduce them on supposition.

    May    1. Sir E.   Home communicated a paper containing some
remarks on the nature of generation and utero-gestation.                After
stating that the process of Nature in this case had hitherto eluded
the observation of the most enlightened physiologists, he ob
served that accident alone had enabled him to develop some
new, and, as he conceived, decisive facts on the subject. A female
servant having left her master's house a few hours on the 7th of

January, returned, and was observed to be more than usually gay
in the evening, having received some present.  A few clays after
she was seized with a fit, and died on the 15th.     Her body
was opened, and an impregnated ovum was found in the uterus j
but it was so extremely small, that although the uterus was ma
cerated in spirit of wine, it would have escaped observation,
had not Mr. Bauer with his powerful microscope discovered and
delineated it. His drawing and description accompanied Sir
Everard's remarks.     The two parts destined to become the head
and heart were distinctly visible; and Sir E. considers this a de
monstrative proof that, contrary to the received opinion, im
pregnation may take place without the existence of the cata-
menia.    He says that every time animals are in heat an ovum
passes from the ovarium into the uterus; and he related a case
of a woman having had three children (being married at seven
teen) previous to menstruation.     In the case alluded to, how
ever, it appears that the woman was at sea, a situation not alto
gether natural.
  May 8.      Sir E. Home furnished some additional remarks on
the nature and effects of an infusion of colchicum autumnale and
eau medicinale on the human constitution in cases of gout, and
their effects on animals.   He observed that the sediment of the
eau medicinale is excessively drastic and severe on the constitu
tion, while that of the infusion of colchicum is about half the
strength of the former ; and that the clear tincture of both is
equally efficacious in curing gout, without being so dreadfully
destructive to the animal constitution.     The result, therefore, of
these new experiments   is,that the clear fluid, either of the vinous
infusion of colchicum or of the eau medicinale^ may be taken with
equal advantage to the health, and much less injury to the body;
but that of the colchicum      much milder.

the medullary parts of various trees, and, on exposing then) to
heat, invariably found that, however tightly driven at first, they
always fell out of the wood.     To this circumstance he ascribes
the cracks or clefts observed in oak and other trees, which have
been hitherto ascribed to the effects of frost.
    May 15 and 22.    A  letter from Dr. John Davy to Sir Hum
phry Davy    was  read, containing an account of many new and
curious experiments and observations on the temperature and
specific gravity of the sea, made during      a   voyage to Ceylon.
Dr. Davy disinclined to believe that the zones have any peculiar

temperature.      It appears that the temperature of the sea is ge
nerally highest about noon, and is higher during a storm; burin
this case the period of highest temperature is somewhat later.
One observation seems highly important, namely, that shallow
water is colder than deep ; and that, in consequence of this dif
ference of temperature, seamen may discover at night when they
approach either shoals, banks, or the shore.       Dr. D. found that
on approaching the coast the water was always two degrees
colder than when in the open sea.         He enumerated the causes
which influence the temperature of the ocean, such as tempests,
currents, and the solar rays.      Many other remarks and experi
ments mentioned in this letter may prove useful to navigators.
The author, however, strongly recommended the general use df
the thermometer to seamen, by means of which he thinks many
new and highly important phenomena may still .be discovered.
     Mr. Sewell, of the Veterinary College, in a letter to the Presi
dent, stated his having discovered a method of curing horses
which are lame in the fore feet.       He observes that many line
horses, in consequence either of being over-driven, or their own
ardent spirit, often become lame in one of the fore feet, and are
consequently consigned to the cart or the butcher.        It occurred
 to him that this lameness might originate in the nerves of the
 foot, near the hoof ; and in consequence he immediately ampu
 tated about an inch of the diseased nerve, taking the usual pre
 caution of guarding the arteries and passing ligatures, &c.       By
 this means the animal was instantly relieved from pain, and the
 lameness perfectly cured.     Mr. Sewell has already cured three
 horses bv this operation.      The Society then adjourned till the
 5th of June.
           BATH LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL          SOCIETY.
     April 2S. Dr. Wilkinson stated to the Society, that the pro
 perties of arsenic, of which so little is as yet known, had occu
 pied much of the attention of the late Professor Tennant of Cam
 bridge ; and that previous to his death he had informed Mr.Gregor,
  an eminent chemist in Cornwall, that from an analysis he had
  made of wootz or Indian steel, he had ascertained that its pe
  culiar hardness arose from a combination of arsenic.
     An account of some experiments by Colonel Beaufoy, on the
  strength of different kinds of wood, was read, and a diagram of
  the apparatus employed, exhibited.      In these experiments the
  different pieces of wood were secured to a firm block of timber
  at one end, and the weights were applied at the other end, to
  which a quadrant was also attached, by means of which the an
  gles of curvature could be ascertained till a fracture took place.
                                                                   The

   378          Bath Literary and Philosophical Society.
      The first experiment was made on a square piece of Dantzie
   oak cut into twenty-five pieces, each piece five feet long and
   two inches square. The mean weight to produce fracture wa§
   1674 lbs. ; tne variation being from 114 lbs. to 214 lbs. The
   section which included the heart of the tree bore 154 lbs., and
   the strength of the other sections diminished in proportion to
   their distance from the heart. The angles of curvature did not
  correspond to the weights employed ; in one piece which bore
  196 lbs. just before fracture, the angle of curvature was 6° 12'j
  another which supported nearly the same weight, viz. 193 lbs.,
  only bent to an. angle of 5e 25' ; while a third piece which broke
  with considerably less weight formed an angle of 70 12'.
   These variations in elasticity appeared to be determined by
  the central relationship of the respective sections of wood ; the
  heart section being the least, and the outer section the most
  elastic.
      It appeared further from Colonel Beaufoy's experiments,, that
  a piece of wood divided into any number of pieces loses strength
  nearly in the proportion of the square root of the number of
  pieces : thus the original piece of Dantzie oak here employed,
  would have supported five times more weight than the sum of
  the weights of the twenty-five pieces into which it had been dir
  vided.
     Experiments were made on timber spliced three different ways,
  and on an average the splicing diminishes the strength nearly
  one-half.
     On a comparison of four different kinds of wood : viz. piteh^
 ,pine, English oak, Riga fir, and Dantzie oak, Colonel Beaufoy
  found the pitch-pine the strongest ; and taking the mean of its
  power of support at 1000, the relative strength of the other
  woods may be stated as follows :
                Pitch-pine    1000 I Riga fir    . .  782
                English oak    923 | Dantzie oak      663
     The weight of Riga fir being to that of English oak as 659 to
  1000, whilst it strength is as 846 to 1000 j it is therefore pre
 ferable in dry buildings to oak for beams, both on account of
 weight and expense.
     Additional experiments, it was stated, had been made on this
 subject by Mr. G. Smart, carpenter, Westminster Bridge, from
which it appeared that there was a remarkable difference in
point of support between timbers lying loose at their ends, and
timbers carefully coaked down on plates of buildings instead of
oeing dovetailed, as is often done in carpentry.        A lath lying
loose at both ends, bent like a hoop and broke with eleven pounds
weight, while a similar lath, which was rendered tight at each
end by shoulders, supported no less than 240 lbs. Mr. Sepping,

  by attending to this important difference.
      Some cylindrical pieces of iron ore from Marlborough Down,
  commonly known by the name of thunderbolts, were exhibited
  to the Society.      They have a stalactitical appearance, and are
  radiated in their structure.      By some they are supposed to be
  pyritical.    On   analysis they are found to contain manganese as
  well as iron, and when exposed to fire become of a reddish cast,
  arising from the additional oxidation of the iron. The pieces
  exhibited were a species of the brown hrematitic iron ore.
      Mr. Rotch made some ingenious observations on lights and
  shades, and illustrated the same by several curious experiments
  made with four pieces of paper, so arranged and cut out, that
, by the different intensities of light passing through, such a varia
  tion of light and shade was produced, as to form the most beau
  tiful and picturesque landscapes. A gentleman had lately shown
  Mr. R. a paper so cut, that the shadow formed on the wall pre
  sented an excellent representation of the Salvator Mundi of
  Guido.
      The meeting concluded by Dr. Wilkinson's examination            of
   the different   theories which had been advanced for explaining
  the phenomena of the Leyden phial.          The Doctor endeavoured
  to show from a variety of experiments, that the results could not
  be reconciled with the theory of Dr. Franklin, or that which
  supposes electricity to be a compound of two species, positive
  and negative, or vitreous and resinous.       The communication of
  Dr. W.'s own theory was promised to be made at the next
  meeting.
  ROYAL ACADEMY         OF SCIENCES AND    LITERATURE   OF BRUSSELS.
      The Academy at a recent meeting proposed the following que
  stion :
      " What are the applications which can be made steam      if
  in domestic ceconomy, and in manufactures, as a means of heat-
   ing?"
      On "this question several memoirs have been presented ; on
  examining which the Academy have awarded the prize of the
  gold medal to one by M. de Hemptinne, physician at Brussels,
   as being, the most distinguished both for practical detail and theo
   retical illustration.
      The following questions are proposed for competition during
   the year 1818:
       1st. What are the particular defects of the sort of bricks made
   in this country (Belgium) ? What means can. be adopted to
   Tender them more perfect ? What are the materials and processes
   employed in the northern provinces of the kingdom, for the fa

   has failed with us ?
      2d. Is it possible, from satisfactory experiments, or reasons
   deduced from the doctrine of determinate proportions, to esta
   blish with certainty that the radical of muriatic acid is a compound
   body ; or is it more probable that the radical is a simple body ?
   In case of no decision on the question, Which of the two methods)
   (experiment or doctrine of determinate proportion?) is best calcu
   lated to simplify the theory of chemical facts ?
      3d. The printing paper of France, and drawing paper fabric
  cated in England, having an acknowledged superiority above those
  of other countries, it is required to know in what that superiority
   consists ?  whether the causes are of a local nature, or depend on
   the materials or mode of manufacture ?                           :
      4th. What is the quantity of water discharged by a river at a
  given place, and during a fixed period of time, the breadth, the
  depth, and declivity of the river being known ? and what are
  the variations which, at the same point, and during the same
  space of time, will take place in that discharge, by diminishing
  progressively, by artificial constructions, the breadth of the river ?

  the weight of twenty-five ducats.       The memoirs to be written in
  Latin, French, Dutch, or German, and given in  those on the
  first three questions, before the 1st February 1818, and that on

  J\ paper     on the ventilation of coal-mines, with a plan of the
 present mode of ventilation, and a plan of a proposed improve
 ment, have been received.        It may appear presumptuous in any
 one not a colliery-viewer, to form even an opinion on the modes
 best adapted for ventilation; but, notwithstanding, we have formed
 an opinion, and we are convinced that the method' usually foi-r
 lowed at Newcastle is not the best that might be adopted. The
 paper that has reached us might improve the system a little ;
 but till we see some demonstration of the inefficacy of that pro
 posed by Mr. Ryan, we think it would be wrong in us to lend
 our aid to recommend others less effectual.         It is asserted, that
 any one of the mines at Newcastle might be properly ventilated
on his plan, at an expense under 100/. A mere denial of the
fact, and much less silence, on a subject involving the safety of
so many lives, will not convince those who have examined thig
subject, that the managers of mines at Newcastle can he justi
fied in any longer refusing to be instructed.

    Iii our abstract from Messrs. Lean's Report for March, pub
lished in our last, there were some errors. The second and third

     The intelligence that a committee of the House of Commons
had been appointed to take the subject of steam-engines into
their consideration excited great alarm* in Cornwall, which may
 be called the land of steam-engines; as it wrts apprehended that
 prejudiced or interested people might press their opinions upon
 the committee, and, taking advantage of the alarm excited by
 the late accident at Norwich, induce some legislative interference,
 without allowing time for proper investigation.             The fear, con
 sidering   the  property that  is at  stake   in Cornwall,       was not un
 reasonable, but we are well assured will prove groundless.                    A
 committee of the House       of  Commons is not likely to be easily
 imposed upon by partial statements.             The one alluded to has
  had a laborious task to perform ; but, whatever might be the
 prejudices with which their minds might be filled in common
 with many others who had been told that steam-engines are
 infernal machines, they have bestowed so much patient investi
 gation on the subject, that the possessors of steam-engines need
 be under little or no alarm about parliamentary interference.
      Any interference of this kind would be injudicious, and
  ppove highly injurious to the progress of national improvement.
  In this view, of the question, nothing could be more natural than
  that the miners in Cornwall should have felt an uncommon de
                                                                             gree

 gree of interest in this question.    For the property embarked
 in these undertakings   is immense, and  the slightest interference
 with any of their machinery might have thrown many thousands
 of labourers entirely out of employment, and have caused such s
 complete inundation of the works as would have required many
years to recover any of them, and have destroyed some of the
deepest mines entirely. In consequence, the miners of Cornwall
 deputed some of their number to wait upon the committee, and
with them Mr. Lean, the gentleman who is employed by the
miners as a body to survey all their steam-engines, and register
 the work performed by each.       In fact, such was the general
alarm, that, could the state of the mines have admitted of their
absence, the managers of the greater part of the Cornish mines,
 there called Captains, would have come to town in a body. One
of them, Captain William Davy, reckoned one of the most in
telligent miners in Cornwall, in answer to a letter from a gentle
man in London, informing him of the attempt made by some
interested or prejudiced individuals to put down all engines
working with steam of high temperature, sent him the following:
                                             " Redruth, May 17, 1817.
   " Dear Sir,  The         contents of your letter have excited no
 small degree of alarm in this quarter, but we have still such
 an idea of the intelligence and information of a committee of the
 House of Commons, as to encourage a hope that the legislature
 will not be advised to adopt any measure which might operate
 to destroy most valuable and extensive property, or even to shut
 the door against further improvement, by any regulations what
 ever ; for all restrictions tend to fetter invention and limit the
powers of intellect.
    " With regard to the benefits which have resulted to the mines
 from the ceconomy of fuel introduced by working with steam of
high temperature, a pretty correct opinion may be formed from
 the monthly Report made by Captain Thomas Lean, who is ap
pointed by the adventurers [proprietors] of the different mines
for that purpose, and paid by them for performing that duty.
These Reports may be relied on.        He keeps the keys of the dif
ferent counters*, and no other person can have access to them.
Our friend Mr. ,          can show you a set of these Reports.
    " Had there been no recent improvement for drawing water
from thedeep mines,  that     is,were we left still to the employment
of only the common condensing engine,  know not I              a single
deep mine in the county that could have been npw in existence
asa   working concern and to stop any one of them at this mo

ment would be productive of the most distressing consequences;

for at this moment we are all driven to our wits end to find em*
 ployment for the poor; and were our mines thrown idle, it is im
 possible to anticipate the result.
    *' As to danger fr«im
                            engines employing steam of high pres
sure, none who are competent to give an opinion on the sub
ject,  and none else have a right to do so,  will so far commit
 themselves as to say that there can be any in working steam of
from 35 to 45 pounds pressure on the square inch in the boiler 
which is the ratio at which Woolf's engines are worked  pro
vided safety valves be employed, and the construction and ma
terials be of a proper quality.     But in fact, this applies also to
the common engine  nay, to every machine of high power em
ployed by man.
    "   As to the common engine being less dangerous than those
employing steam of higher temperature, the idea is quite ground
less ; for those who make them proportion the strength and
substance of their materials accordingly,  nor do they ever give
 their boiler the same strength for a pressure of six or seven pounds
 which they would for a pressure of forty. In point of fact, I have
 known several instances of accidents in consequence of the boilers
 of common engines giving way,  I mean such accidents as have
 caused the loss of livea,  but we have had none of this kind from
 Woolf's boilers. By the bursting of a common wrought-iroa
 boiler at Poldory mine, three men were killed and three badly
 scalded : at Chasewater, two horses were killed by the explosion
 of the boiler, though at work in a different building from the
 boiler house. There was also a serious accident at Crenver from
 one of the common boilers, which caused the loss of several
 lives.    I could name several other accidents of tlmkind; and
 therefore I cannot but reprobate the idea of any interference
 which would compel us to employ these engines or boilers in
 preference to others.  Dear sir,

     As several steam engines,   besides   those to which   Mr. Woolf's
 name is attached in Messrs. Lean's monthly Report, appear to be
  doing considerably more, duty than the common engines have
 been supposed capable of performing, a correspondent requests
 that Messrs. Lean will, at the bottom of their monthly Report, or
 through the medium of The Philosophical Magazine, state the
 cause or causes of this improvement.            Has the increased work
 been produced by employing      steam    of  high temperature, suffered
 to expand in the working cylinder, and then condensed, en the

 and if so, in what does the improvement consist ?-~or from these
 and other causes combined ? As particular an answer as possible
 would at the present moment be peculiarly interesting, as it is
 known that some questions connected with the use of this most
 powerful agent now occupy the attention of a committee of the

               COLLIER OR MINER LIFE PRESERVER.
    We have just seen a very curious contrivance by Mr.Geo.Prior,
 watch-maker of Leeds, (son of Mr. John Prior, the celebrated
 Yorkshire mechanic,) which may be considered as a Collier or
 Miner Life Preserver, and which combines the two advantages
 of simplicity and efficacy. The object of this invention      is,
                                                              to pre

 breaking of the ropes       by
                             which corves or buckets are let into the
 coal-pits  or  mines.  To  effect this purpose, iron pins are intro
 duced into the upright    frame   on  which the corfe slides. The
apparatus to whieh the corfe      isfixed isfurnished with    power

 ful spring catch on each side, which; without causing any friction
in the ordinary working of the corfe, opens out the moment the
rope breaks, and, fixing itself on the iron pins, causes the corfe
to be suspended, and prevents the person in      itfrom being preci
pitated   to   the bottom   of the   pit.  This  apparatus, which         is
adapted to the machinery now in use by the miners, adds very
little weight to the corfe, and may be fitted up at trifling ex

to a man of war, and that it will secure her from the danger of
shipwreck. The strength of a single man, or at most that of a
horse, is sufficient to put the machine in motion.
                         PERPETUAL MOTION.
   Another to the many supposed solutions of the problem of
perpetual motion has just been added by a M. Louis of Valence,
formerly captain in the Neapolitan service.         He has found, he
says,
       " means    to raise a column  of water strong enough to force
another   to the  same  height,  which  produces in its turn the same
effect.    Thus, when the impulse is once given, this machine will
perpetually retain its action, if there exists a fluid which does
not lose by evaporation, or a material indestructible by use. One
may, however, employ a quantity of water sufficient to keep the
machine in play for several years.        This same machine may be
employed,    as  the impelling power, for the production of various
kinds of regular motions.        The inventor proposes to adapt a
clepsydra to   it, and he   isconvinced that,     means of basin or
                                                      by              a
reservoir, a private house might derive various advantages from
it."

    The quantity of alkali in pumice is much less than in any of
the above-named varieties of felspar ; but it appears to me that
it is by no means unphilosophical to suppose that a part of the
alkali in felspar may be volatilized by a long continued heat.
     Secondly, both obsidian and pumice
                                             " give in fire exactly the
same products," and        " both these fossils not only accompany
each other at Lipari, but likewise frequently occur actually
blended." Klaproth' s Analyses, vol. Hi.
    There is a circumstance relative to the origin of pumice, which
I own I cannot account for. It is this, that obsidian and lava
should contain pyroxene, while the analysis of pumice-stone does
not even indicate the presence of either lime or magnesia, both
of which were found in considerable quantity by Vauquelin in
his analyses of the pyroxene of Mtna, and in the granular variety
of the same mineral, called coccolite.  Vide Lucas Tableau des
Especes Minerales, part i. Paris 1808.
    The fact, that obsidian and pumice, though so different in
composition, give the same products by heat, may appear to mi
litate against the above ideas ; but it seems probable that the
felspar only is fused in the experiment, and that the pyroxene is
merely enveloped in the paste formed by the former mineral, as,
if an attempt is made to fuse pounded granite, the felspar is vi
 trified, while the quartz remains in its pristine state enveloped
 in it.

    P.S. In the xlviiith volume of the Philosophical Magazine you
have affirmed that the Waterloo or Strand Bridge is entirely con
structed of granite. This is not exactly the case, as, though gra
nite is by far the predominating material of that structure, it
contains a considerable quantity of red. calcareous gritstone, and
 of white, laminated, micaceous sandstone.
     *#* Our correspondent is right respecting the materials of the
 Strand Bridge : but we meant only that the principal material
 was granite; every part'of the visible exterior of the structure is
 composed of that species of stone.  Editor.
                          WATERS OF BADEN.
     M. Gimbcrnat has found on analysis, that the gas of these ce
 lebrated waters is not, as has been generally believed, carbonic
 acid, but azote. By collecting and condensing the vapours which
 rise from the principal spring, he has obtained a mineral water
 which differs essentially in its chemical properties from the water
 which issues from the rock. It is more gaseous, and more im
 pregnated with animal principles ; whence M. G. believes it will
 be found even more salutary than the baths themselves, into
 which the water does not flow till after a great portion of its vo
 latile properties has evaporated, in consequence of its high tem
 perature, and its exposure to the air. In this opmion he has been
  confirmed by the singular fact, that the whole interior of the
  chimney above the spring, and through which its vapours have
  passed from time immemorial, has become covered with a thick
  and greasy tegument, which is evidently of a vegeto- animal na
  ture, and proves the sanatory quality of gas volatilized by thermal
  heat.

  vessel with a still capable of supplying water to the whole crew,

       SiRy Wishing to encroach as little as possible On your pages,
  the paper I sent you, and which appeared in Vout last, was
  abridged from one bf greater length.              Unfortunately some am
  biguity has thereby been introduced, by retaining a passage in
  page 284, alluding to some observations which had been ex
  punged from another part of the paper.              Your readers are re
  quested to omit the paragraph between line 36 and line 45,
  which will considerably diminish the obscurity.
       At the close of the paper an idea is held out that animalcules
  may exist in vegetables) and extend their race with the vegetable
  process; That such is the fact I am strongly persuaded; and it is
  equally probable, from a variety of phenomena, that the organic
  structure on which the vegetable process depends, as well as the
  exquisite design and beauty manifested throughout the vegetable
  kingdom, are derived from the instinctive influence of this nu
  merous class of active agents. But as an investigation of such an
  extensive nature is not comprehended in the object of the pre
  sent letter^ I shall wave the inquiry until a future, opportunity.
       An insertioh of these remarks in your next Number will con
   fer another obligation on
                             Your very obedient servant,

                                 To Mr. Tilloch.
        Sir, The following memoranda were drawn up by Mr.Burck-
   hardt, Superintendant of the Observatory of the Ecole Militaire
   at Paris, by desire of Count Laplace ! as the publication of them
   may be of considerable service to science, 1 send you a copy for
    insertion in your Magazine.
                           I am, sir, your obedient humble servant,
                                                               Al  Raschid.

bfotc on Observations which should he attended to for the Pur
             pose of determining the Sun's Parallax.
   1. There will be an opposition of Mars in December 1817.
   This planet will be for some time on the parallel of the 1 18th
star of Taurus, whose mean position on the 1st January 1818
will be A\ 79' 31' 9"-4. Dec. 24° 59' 32 '-3. From the 19th
November the difference of declination between the planet and
the star will be only eight minutes ; and that of their right ascen
sion in time only a few minutes.      It will be no difficult matter,
therefore, to measure their difference of declination several times
each night, which, compared with observations of the same taken
 in Europe, will give the.parallax of Mars.
    N. B. It must be remarked, that the star is double; but as
the distance between the two stars is small, it will be best to refer
 the interval which separates them to the planet.
    2. The same by the inferior conjunction of Venus on the 26th
 December 1818.
    On the, 24th November Venus will be in conjunction with <r Ca-
 pricojni, and their difference of latitude will be only 5 minutes.
    On the 19th December the planet will be on the parallel of
* Sagittarii.
  And on the 21st December on that of <r Sagittarii.
   But as it is not likely that these stars can be easily seen in the
daytime, within so small a distance from the sun, it will be better
to compare the planet with Antares A\ 16h IS"<, and Dec. 26' S.
on the parallel of which star it will be 28th November.
   If   these phenomena  could be observed in India, and at the
 Cape of Good Hope, the parallax of Venus might be obtained
 with great precision.    The absolute error of the instrument
 would be immaterial, provided the planet were always referred to
 the star.
                           NEW COMET.
    Midwolda, April 13. -Yesterday evening, about fifteen mi
 nutes past ten o'clock, a comet was seen in the west, but on
 account of the dark clouds was not visible above three minutes.
 Its light so much outshone the stars, that it was not easy to de
 termine precisely in what constellation it appeared. It was in or
 near Gemini.
    The above notice in the foreign journals having led to a very
 diligent scrutiny of the heavens by the astronomers of this coun
 try, the following are the reports of the only successful observa
 tions which we believe have as yet been made in England.
    To the Editor,  Sir, the appearance of a telescopic comet
 having been announced in some of the continental journals, I

night of the 2d May instant, during a break in the clouds which
enabled me to see the constellation Leo, 1 noticed, just above
the star Regnlus, or alpha Leonis, a small luminous speck, the
light of which did not resemble that of a common star. On ob
serving it for several nights afterwards, it diminished in size, and
is now lost in my telescope. Perhaps some of your readers, who
may have a telescope of greater magnifying powers, may discover
 it even now.           I am, sir, &c.
Speldhnrst, May 19, 1817.                                           S. R.
    P. S. The phenomenon was seen first about 9 P. M. and was
situated about 10 E.S.E. of Regulus. The latitude of this place
 is scarcely t E.
                                                  Tunbridge Wells, May 18.
    A luminous appearance was,         a  few nights ago, discovered in
the constellation of the Lion, which had the appearance of a very-
 distant comet.    It can only be seen by a telescope of conside
rable magnifying power.         Its place in the heavens is about 10'
NNE of the star Regulus in the Coeur du Lion.
                              METEOROLOGY.
    A gentleman who      has been examining      the different meteorolo
gical instruments    in  various  parts  of England, with a view to as
certain the cause of the apparent errors in the Meteorological
Journals, has found one cause to be, that the wind is often erro
neously put down.        The'cardinal points on the weather-cocks
are in general put according to the compass, instead of the sun;
consequently the north point is about 20° west of due north, and
all the others are proportionally wrong.          A gentleman at Walt-
hamstow has recently constructed a weather vane, which rings a
bell at every turn of the vane by the most gentle change of wind.
It is also constructed with a spherical cannister of oil at the top,
which can diop continually into the hinge, and will not be ex
hausted for many years.

                    Mr. Westgarth Forster.
                          To   Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,       Ilately by accident (not being a constant reader)
 met with your very excellent Magazine, vol. xlv. art. 17, in
 which I have the gratification to find some encomiums made
upon my Treatise on a Section of the Strata, commencing near
 Newcastle-upon-Tyne, &c. by Robert Bakewell, esq., for which
 I beg leave to return my grateful acknowledgements.
    I have also taken notice of some queries, by a correspondent,
 with the signature of   "A  Constant Reader," (art. 19, vol. xlv.)
 respecting the occurrence of the grindstone-sill.      In reply ; he
 will find the stratum, which is quarried for grindstones on
 Gateshead-fell,    at No. 10 on my section, and denominated by
 the colliery sinkers, brown sandstone or post; the other, he will
 find by the provincial name of grindstone-sill, not from its being
 quarried for grindstones, it being a coarser stratum. It probably
 derived its name from its resemblance to the above ; but it is
 a distinct stratum, and far below the Newcastle one; and is
 nearly the uppermost bed, on Cross-fell, Kilhope-head, Ramgill-
head, Shorngate-cross, &c.
    I likewise observe, that the same correspondent is desirous
 to know, where the iron-stone balls are lodged. Now, by re
ference to my section, he will find a plate-bed where they fre
quently occur, immediately above the tumbler- beds of the great
limestone, marked 326 on the sectional scale, and commonly
called by the miners cat-heads ; which may very probably have
" bivalve shells" inclosed, although I do not perfectly recollect
observing them.
    Nat. John Winch, esq. states, that my section has been fur
nished from a similar engraving published at Carlisle (and signed
 Wm. Millot miner, which must be Miller) in the year 1800,
mid likewise from a section of the coal-strata sunk through at
Byker St. Anthony ; together with that of Sheriff-hill colliery,
printed in Hutchinson's History of Durham.         I must vindicate
myself by stating to Mr. Winch, that indeed I did see Miller's
section previous to my publication ; but so far from making any
use of
       it,    did not copy a single stratum from              it,

do not wish to claim the priority of either Miller's, or any other
section of the coal-measures       but this
                                   :           must state, that my

section was entirely made from my own observations, and ad

    XCII.      Experiments    relative to the Action of Hydrochloric Acid
      upon Mixtures       of Tin and Antimony. By M. Cuaudet*.
    The       very lively action which hydrochloric acid exerts when
    brought in contact with tin, compared with the almost insensU
    ble influence which it has upon antimony, led M. Thenard to
    think that it might be employed as a means of separating these
    two metals when found in union ; but the experiments which he
    made, with this object, were not attended with the success he-
    anticipated.
        Having procured tin and antimony in as pure a state as pos
    sible,   I began by examining the action of hydrochloric acid on
    these two metals taketi separately.
        I flattened, to about the thickness of        a centime,   a  portion of
    the tin, and put it into a phial, into which I            afterwards intro
    duced a certain quantity of hydrochloric acid perfectly pure, the
    specific weight of which was 1 1 90, and which marked 22°
    on an areometer of Baume's.             At the end of six hours the dis
    solution was perfectly complete.
        On applying a slight boiling heat to the same mixture, the dis
    solution was completed in one hour.
        I then pounded 100 parts of antimony to a fine powder, and
    put them into a phial with a quantity of hydrochloric acid.
    After remaining twenty-four hours in a cold place, I found that
    96 parts of the antimony remained at the bottom of the vessel,
    and that only four parts had dissolved f.
                                                                           A like
\      * From the Annates de Chimie et de. Physique for December 1816.
       + After being  some hours in the glass, the liquor which was at first white
    became yellowish.     On shaking the glass this colour disappeared, but re
    turned in a few hours after : the glass being again shaken, the colour agaiu
    disappeared ;  and as often as the same operation was repeated a like result
  ,                                                                     followed.

               upon the   Mixtures of Tin and Antimony.                403
   A like mixture being set to boil, a similar proportion of four
parts of antimony was found dissolved at the end of three hours.
   The dissolution of these four parts in both cases appeared to
be greatly owing to the presence of sulphuret of antimony in
the antimony employed, a slight disengagement of sulphuretted
hydrogen gas having been observed during the dissolution.
   I next made two mixtures ; one containing equal parts of tin
and of antimony, and another 25 parts of antimony and 75 of
tin.
   The first of these mixtures, though harder than antimony, was
so brittle rhut it broke on falling to the ground, and was very
easily reduced to a fine powder.     Its specific weight, estimated
with much care, was found to be C-ti03, the water distilled
forming 1.
   The second mixture, the specific weight of which was found to
be 7-059, was first flattened with a hammer and then slightly
chopped.     It was easy to perceive that the tin had, with the
smaller proportion of antimony here combined, already lost
somewhat of its ductility.
  The following are the experiments which   made on these I
mixtures :
   First Experiment.     One hundred parts of the first mixture,
containing equal parts of tin and antimony, with an equal pro
portion reduced to a fine powder, were heated and treated with
hydrochloric acid :^-the action seemed very slight ; the metal
preserved its whiteness iind its metallic brilliancy. After about
three hours of ebullition I filtered the mixture, and found that
33 parts of the metal had been dissolved.
   Second Experiment.      One hundred parts of the second mix
ture, containing twenty-five parts of antimony and seventy-five
of tin, after being beaten very thin, were heated and treated with
hydrochloric acid.     The action was much greater than in the
preceding experiment ; the metal from being perfectly white
became slightly browned.     After an hour of ebullition, no in
crease of action appearing, I filtered, and found that 53 parts of
the metal had been dissolved.
   From these two experiments it was easy to see that the anti
mony, besides being itself nearly insoluble in the hydrochloric
acid, served to counteract the dissolution of the tin; and that           it)
proportion as there was less of antimony        the mixture, there
                                                     in
was more of the tin dissolved,
followed.      This yellow colour undoubtedly owirrg to certain quantity
                                    is                        a

 404    Experiments with Hydrochloric Acid upon Tint           &c.
      On recalling to mind the process which is used to extract by
 means of nitric acid the silver contained in gold, and the neces
  sity there is in that case of employing three parts of silver to
  one of gold  a process commonly known by the name of
  quartation,  it occurred to me that tin might be to antimony as
 silver is to gold, and that the proportion of tin necessary to the
  quart atian of antimony ought to be much greater than what
  I had used in the preceding experiments,  that this only re
  quired to be sought after to be ascertained.      I accordingly made
 the' following   experiment  :
    . Third Experiment.      I weighed with great care, in     a balance
 capable of indicating the very nicest proportions, ten parts of an
 timony and 90 parts of tin, being as nine to one.          I enveloped
 the whole in a piece of paper, placed it in the bottom of a small
 experimenting crucible, covered it with a layer of fine powder
 of charcoal, in order to prevent oxidation, and subjected it to
 the heat of an essay furnace for ten minutes.      I then withdrew the
 crucible from the fire, and allowed it to cool.       On examining it
  I  found a small drossy mass, which I first brushed carefully, then
 flattened, and afterwards cut into a number of pieces. I wrapped up
 these anew inpapeY, and subjected them to the heat of the stove
 in the same manner as before. The mixture being again cooled
 and well brushed, was without being flattened fused a third time,
 and only a very small slip of paper interposed between it and the
 charcoal.     The residue which 1 now obtained consisted of a small
 compact knob, of metallic brilliancy, and exactly 100 parts in
  weight.    I flattened this as thin as I could, and cut it with
 scissars into small fragments, which 1 put into a phial and after
 wards saturated with hydrochloric acid.            Having boiled the
 whole for two hours, I allowed it to cool, and then collected upon
 a filter the portion not dissolved.     I found it to be of the weight
 of twelve parts   in place of ten.
      Fourth Experiment.        1 joined with the same care    as in the
 preceding experiment, five parts of antimony to 100 of tin, being
 as 1 to 20.     The knob obtained as before, being flattened as
 thin as possible, cut into pieces, and these put into glass ; I sa
turated them with hydrochloric acid.           The action was quick,
 and at the end of a quarter of an hour the dissolution appeared
 almost complete.       The antimony abstracted floated in the li
quor : I made it still boil for two hours longer; and on then
collecting the residue on a filter, I found just five parts of anti
mony  being tbe precise quantity which I had put into the mix
ture.
      On repeating this experiment, I -obtained exactly^ the same
result.
                                                                 I made

                  On the Cultivation      of the Parsnip.                  405
   I made a similar one jvith 15 parts only of tin in place of
20 to one of antimony, and found a surplus.
   In another experiment, with the tin in the proportion of 30
to one, the result gave me back exactly the proportion of anti
mony put into the mixture.
   I last of all put only a centime, and afterwards the fourth of a
centime of antimony to 100 parts of tin, and recovered them
perfectly.
    The antimony in these different experiments was extremely
divided, of a blackish gray colour, settled easily at the bottom
of the vessel, and occupied, in proportion to its weight, a very
considerable space, so as to enable even imponderable quantities
to be discerned.
    It is after all very true, that antimony as well as tin is soluble
in hydrochloric acid, and that its presence was not indiscernible
in the hydrochlorate of tin produced in the fourth experiment.
But this I think may be easily reconciled with the truth of the
preceding results.      The hydrochloric acid having a remarkable
affinity to tin, would of course saturate it first, and thus lose al
most entirely its power of acting on the antimony.       It is hard to
believe that any tin can remain in alliance with the antimony,
when we find the different residues corresponding so exactly
with the quantities of antimony introduced ; and much more
probable that the portion of antimony observable in the hydro-
chlorate of tin, may be a portion not appreciable by weight.
   As it often happens that lead is joined to the tin already united
with the antimony, I made an experiment in order to ascertain
at what point this new metal might be able to change the re
sults obtained by my preceding mode of analysis ; and I perfectly
satisfied myself that the mixture of tin and antimony may con
tain large enough quantities of lead without affecting the success
of the operation.
XC1II.     On the Cultivation     of the Parsnip,    as  it is practised    iip
        Guernsey.      By Dr. Maccujlloch,         of   Woolwich*.
The    great superiority of this root, as cultivated in Guernsey
and the neighbouring islands, to its produce in Britain,  the
high reputation which     bears among the farmers in those islands,
                          it
and the very little knowledge of        it,
                                       which those of Britain seem
to possess,  have induced me to lay before the Society       short a
account of the methods practised in its culture           in
                                                      Guernsey.
 I   am inclined to think, that    will be found much more worthy
                                   it
the attention of agriculturists  than   has been hitherto supposed,
    <U+2666>   From the Transactions of the Caledonian Horticultural   Society.
                                   C  c   3                                and

406                    On the Cultivation   of the Parsnips
 and that    it will form a material and valuable addition to the
 system   of green crops, when it shall become better known.
    But it is chiefly on account of the power which it possesses,
 of resisting the injuries of frost, that I have ventured to point
 it out as an object of attention to the Caledonian Horticultural
 Society.     The injury which the green crops, commonly culti
 vated in the northern parts of our island, suffer from this enemy,
 is such as to render it highly desirable to find one which shall be
 exempt from the effects of winter.
      It   has been hitherto   but generally and carelessly said, and as
 if   the fact was not well ascertained,     that this root did not suffer
   from frost.     The unusually severe winter of 1813-14 has en
   abled me to decide this question most positively; and to name
   the parsnip as perhaps the only cultivated root which appears
   to defy all cold.      In the garden of my friend Mr. Mathews, at
   Waltham Abbey, a crop of parsnips was suffered to continue in
   the ground throughout the winter.          That land is well known to
   be wet meadow land, and was frozen in a solid mass, to the
   depth of a foot or more.      The roots remained unhurt ; and while
    1 write, in the beginning of April 1814, they are all putting out
   their new shoots.      This hardiness, which would render the pars
   nip a desirable object of cultivation in the coldest parts of Scot
   land, would still more recommend its use to the unfortunate
   Gieenlanders, among whom the esculent vegetables have hitherto
   been limited to two or three, and where the parsnip has not as
   yet been introduced.        If other circumstances (the method of
   culture, the deep ploughing required, and the nature of the soil
   necessary for this root,) do not prevent its introduction into the
   Highlands, it may eventually be found a valuable substitute for
   the potatoe, in many situations where the early frosts often de-
t, stroy that plant long before the tubers have arrived at maturity.
    It is no small additional merit, that it is nearly exempt from the
   attacks of insects; and from the diseases incident to all our
                                                          '
   esculent roots, as well as from the effects of cold.     In wet springs
   only   it is remarked,   that  the plants  in Guernsev   are sometimes
   destroyed by slugs, and that extremes of dryness or moisture
    protracted through the season are injurious to them.
       The superior quality and size of the root in Guernsey appears
    to be the result of the long-continued care and attention be
   stowed on     it,since there   isnothing in the soil of that island to
    account for this difference    ; and since that soil itself      is noby
    means of very superior quality.
               a                           The greater part of the inland

   by process of rotting or. gangrene similar to that which occurs

cessfully carried on, even in situations where the land           stiff* cold,                     is

it   will be observed                   by
                              and by, that two varieties are in use, of
 which the one       much shorter than the other
                          is                             and consequently            ;
 better adapted to soils of no great depth.
     These two principal varieties, cultivated               Guernsey, are               in
 known     by the name of the Cocjuaine and the Lisbonaise.
     The first of these roots       the finest, and sometimes runs four

 grow to considerable height, and proceed from the whole crown

     The lisbonaise does not extend to so great            depth as the co-          a

  variety cultivated in Britain,        will be seen that the former are

  the same extent of ground.
     From these considerations,         would be advisable to cultivate
                                                       it
  the Guernsey varieties in this country,             procuring the seeds       by
  from that place, and to abandon those whose produce seems in
 every respect inferior.
     Although this root      cultivated in almost all the soils of that

 40$               On the Cultivation       of the Parsnip,
 land is prepared for sowing by means of two ploughs.                 A small
plough precedes, and opens the furrow to the depth of four inches,
and is followed by a larger plough, drawn by four or six oxen and
 as many horses, which deepens the furrow to ten or fourteen
 inches.    This plough is called the gravde c/iarrue; and as the
 small farms into which Guernsey is divided do not admit of such
 an army of cattle in the possession of any one farmer, this work
 is performed by a contribution of the neighbours, who are repaid
by the like joint-stock assistance, the whole being attended with
 a holiday- like bustle, that cannot fail to surprise a stranger.               I
 need not remark, that a more accurate system of husbandry could
 accomplish the subsequent trenching and turning up of the first
 furrow with much less force.          The spade is used for this purpose
 in some parts of France as well as in Jersey, but is less expedi
 tious and ceconomical than a judicious use of the trenching-
plough. As soon as the clods are capable of being broken, the
 harrowihg commences, and is repeated till the soil is pulverized,
 and reduced nearly to the state of garden mould.                 The whole
 of these processes are intended to loosen the soil to as great a
 depth as possible.
     The seed should not be more than a year old, as it is uncertain
when of a greater age.          It is sown broadcast, and in a day just
 so windy as to insure its regular spreading over the surface. The
 seed is then covered by the harrow.           The quantity sown is from
half a denerel* to one denerel per vergfe.             The half denerel is
judged sufficient; but many farmers sow the whole, to enable
them to harrow the land before the first weeding, by which means
they destroy so many weeds as to save much of the after hand-
weeding.      As soon as the plants are sufficiently strong, they are
hand-weeded and thinned ; and this operation must be repeated
 at least three times during the summer.            The distance between
the plants is ultimately about nine inches ; and, to save a por
tion of the labour, a harrowing is sometimes given between the
first and second weedings.           The expense of weeding a vergCe
three times, is thirty shillings.          1 believe that the     practice of
drilling and horse-hoeing, by which much labour might probably
be saved, has never been attempted in Guernsey, where agricul
ture has not arrived at that perfection which it has attained in
this country, and where, from the infinitely small division of
property, and consequent size of the farms, with the almost un
avoidable attachment to ancient practices which accompanies
these circumstances, its operations are in general antiquated.
    * The denerel is four quarts ; the vergee 17,640 square feet; 2-46 zergecs
are equal to an English acre, which consequently gives about ten quarts to
the acre.   The price of parsnip seed while I v. rite, is jis. 6d. the denerel,
making the whole expense per acre nearly 7s. 6d.
                                                                             It

                     as it is practised in Guernsey.                  409
It  is indeed said, that in other countries, where this method ha*
been tried, it has not been found to answer so well as the system
 of broadcast culture.
    The first weeding is performed about the middle of Mav, or
it maybe earlier or later according to the state of the plants ; it
is repeated when necessary, till the beginning of July.           The di
stance at which the plants are allowed to remain, is greater in
Guernsey than in England, where they are suffered to stand at
six inches asunder.
    Although the general practice is that which I have now de
scribed, the seed is sometimes sown at the latter end of Septem
ber or beginning of October, and the plants are found to pass
the winter well, and produce a good crop.             It is supposed that
they may thus become strong before they can be injured by
weeds.     There is also some variation in the time of the spring
sowing.     Where the soil is a rich sandy and dry loam, the seed
js sown early in January; but the general period of sowing over
the whole island, is from the middle of February to the beginning
of March, except in stiff and wet lands, where it is deferred for
a  fortnight.
    The produce per acre is considerably greater than that of
the carrot.    A good crop in Guernsey         is considered   17,600 lbs.
per vergee,    or about 44,000 lbs. per English acre. This is a
less heavy crop than the turnip, but it is much more consider
able than that either of the carrot or potatoe.            If we consider
at the same time that the quantity of saccharine, mucilaginous,
and, generally speaking, of nutritious matter in the parsnip, bears
a far larger proportion to the water, than it does in the turnip,
its superiority in point of produce will appear in this case also
to  be greater.
    The roots   are dug up about     the middle of August, when they
are thought to be most nutritious,        and to fatten animals better
than after the leaves are decayed.         I do not understand that the
green tops are    used  in  Guernsey, although in England they have
been found as useful for live stock, as other green food, either
consumed in the field, or cut off when the roots are taken up.
The quantity dug up at this season is not more than is required
for two or three days consumption.            It is only in October that
the root is fully ripe, when it may be dug up with forks, and pre
served dry in sheds during the winter ; but it is usually left in the
ground in Guernsey, where frost is rare, and taken up as it is
wanted.
    The parsnip is considered by the farmers of Guernsey as the
best fallow crop known, and as in the greatest degree influencing
the subsequent crop of grain.         In Jersey, it is the usual practice
to follow it by wheat* As         it draws   its nourishment from the
                                                                   deeper

410             On the Cultivation of    the Pannip,
deeper parts of the soil, it is evident that it is particularly cal
culated to succeed the generality of fibrous-rooted vegetables.
If sown, therefore, after a hay Or barley crop, it seldom needs any
manure, and yields a very good produce without it.           In Eng
land, where manure is required, farm-yard dung is preferred,
and it is turned into the soil by a light plough, immediately be
fore sowing the seed.     But in Guernsey, sea-weed is universally
adopted when it can be obtained  a species of manure in which
many districts of the Highlands abound, although its use is by
no means so extensive as it deserves to be.      The recent and ap
parently steady diminution in the price of kelp now going on>
will doubtless introduce this valuable manure into much greater
use in the Highlands, than has hitherto been the case.
    The parsnip is considered by the Guernsey fanners to be the
most nutritious root known, superior cvOn to the carrot and the
potatoe.    When small, it is given to the animals whole ; but
when large, it is sliced longitudinally.     As no farmer in Guern
sey feeds his horses or cattle on parsnips alone, it is not possible
 to determine its exact value from their practice, with the ac
 curacy which the more scientific agriculturists of this country
would desire.    The art has .not yet attained in that island the
same precision, nor been subjected to the same laws of rigid cal
 culation, which it has undergone in Britain.        But a tolerable
conclusion may be drawn of the efficiency of this root, even from
the examination of the testimony of Guernsey farmers.
    Cows fed with parsnips are said not to yield so great a quan
tity of milk as when fed with turnips : but tlie milk is ricl*er,
and the butter is better, as well as in far greater proportion ; and
both are also free from the disagreeable flavour which they ac
quire from turnips; a circumstance highly deserving the atten
tion of those dairy farmers who supply the population of great
towns with these indispensable articles of consumption.          They
are in fact equal to those which are produced by feeding in the
best pastures.    These animals, when intended for the butcher,
are observed to fatten faster and better on parsnips than on any
pther food.    The only precaution used, is to interpose hay, to
prevent them from being surfeited with the root.            It is also
found necessary to begin with a smaller proportion, as they are
apt to be satiated with this food in the first week, if given to ex
cess.   After that period, it is remarked that it may be used iu
any quantity.
   The fanners are of opinion that cabbages are the best sub
stance to interpose for this purpose, although turnips or hay may
also be given with the parsnip.      The allowance for fattening an
ox who will weigh 1 1 00 lbs. is 1 20 lbs. per day, exclusive of hay.
As far as any experiments have been made in England, the re
                                                                  sults

                    as it is practised in Guernsey*               411
suits tally with those here reported.       The cattle were found to
fatten quicker, and become more bulky, than when fed with any
Other root ; and the meat has also, turned out more sweet and
delicate.     In some experiments, recorded as having been made
by an experienced farmer in Surrey, an ox was fattened from
the plough on parsnips alone in thirteen weeks.            I may add,
that in many parts of France, and among the rest in Brittany,
where this root is extensively cultivated, the same results have
been obtained.        Reef fattened with parsnips fetches a half
penny per pound more in Jersey than under any other system of
fattening.
     Hogs prefer this root to all others, and make excellent pork ;
but it is fancied in Guernsey, that the boiling of the root renders
the bacon flabby.       It has, however, been found in the trials of
the Surrey farmer above mentioned, that the hogs became sa
tiated with the raw parsnips before they were fattened, upon
 which he caused them to be boiled, with good effect.        The ani
 mal can be fattened in six weeks by this food.
     Horses are equally fond of the parsnip, although, from eating
 it with too much avidity, it is said sometimes to stick in the
 throat, and to choke them.         But this may be easily prevented
 by cutting the roots into pieces before they are given.      The use
 of parsnips is said to affect the eyes of this animal ; but we may
 safely consider this assertion as somewhat apocryphal.          They
 are found to supersede the necessity of corn, except when the
 work is excessive ; and in Brittany they are even used for this
 purpose, to the exclusion of corn.
     I may add, that it is a popular opinion among the Jersey
 farmers, that all animals intended for the butcher may be fattened
  on parsnips in nearly half the time, and with half the quantity
 which is required in feeding them with potatoes.          This must,
  however, be taken rather as a general opinion, with regard to
  the superiority of the one root over the other, than as the result
  of any accurate set of experiments; since the practices of agricul
  ture in that island, as well as in Guernsey, are by no means re
  duced to that nicety of calculation which they have hitherto ex
  perienced in Britain.
     In Brittany they also form a principal article of the food of the
  people, and are still used largely, notwithstanding the introduc
  tion of the potatoe ; but I need scarcely add, that, as in the
  case of most other roots, the potatoe has to a great degree also
  diminished the consumption, of parsnips as an article of human
  food.   The peculiarity of their flavour is such, as perhaps for
  ever to prevent them from entering into competition with that
  most valuable plant ; although in situations similaT to the high
  land districts to which I have above alluded, the cultivation of the
                                                               parsnip

 412            A Method of cultivating       Asparagus,
parsnip, to a certain extent, might probably be found a useful
resource, at least as an auxiliary article of- food, in case of the
failure of the potatoe.
    Before terminating this paper, I may remark, that a species
of wine has been often manufactured from the fermented juice
of parsnips, and that report speaks in its favour.        I have no ex
perience of it ; and for obvious reasons, there has never been
any temptation in Guernsey or its neighbour islands to discover
substitutes for the untaxed and superior produce of the vine.
Nor do I know that the parsnip wash has been subjected to di
stillation. It would be worthy the attention of the Society to
inquire, whether the spirit produced from it might not become
a substitute for whisky, since the produce per acre would un
questionably be much greater.
    I may also add, that parsnips are cultivated to great extent in
Jersey as well as in Guernsey, and with the same favourable re
sults, though with some little variation in the process.
    The preparation of the land there, and the other previous ar
rangements, are similar to those already described.            After the
harrow, the ground is dibbled with beans, in rows at five feet di
stance.     The parsnip-seed is then sowed over the whole, broad
cast.    In  May the hand- weeding commences, and the parsnips
are thinned to the requisite distance.        The beans are pulled up      
by hand in September, and the parsnip crop is then disposed of
as in Guernsey.      I have not been able to procure any accurate
estimate of the comparative value of the two processes, nor to
learn how far the bulk of the parsnip crop is diminished by the
additional incumbrance imposed on the land by the beans.
XCIV.      A Method of cultivating Asparagus,     as it is practised in
                 France.     By Dr. Macculloch *.
That      part of the garden which is longest exposed to the sun,
and least shaded by shrubs and trees, is to be chosen for the si
tuation of the asparagus quarter.        A pit is then to be dug five
feet in depth, and the mould which is taken from it must be
sifted, taking care to reject al! stones, even as low in size as a
filberd nut.    The best parts of the mould must then be laid
aside for making up the beds.
    The materials of the bed arc then to be laid in the following
proportions and order :
               Six inches of common dunghill manure.
               Eight inches of turf.
               Six inches of dung as before.
      * From the Transactions of the Caledonian Horticultural
                                                              Society.
                                                                       Six

                    as it is practised in France.                   4 IS
               Six inches of sifted earth.
               Eight inches of turf.
               Six inches of very rotten dung.
               Eight inches of the best earth.
   The last layer of earth must then be well mixed with the last
of dung.
   The quarter must now he divided into beds five feet wide, by
paths constructed of turf, two feet in breadth, and one foot in thick
ness. The asparagus must he planted about the end of March,
eighteen inches asunder.       In planting them, the bud, or top of
the shoot, is to be placed at the depth of an inch and a half in
the ground, while the roots must be spread out as wide as pos
sible, in the form of an umbrella.       A small hit of stick must be
placed as a mark at each plant,      as it is laid in the ground.     As
soon as the earth is settled and dry, a spadeful of fine sand is to
be thrown on each plant, in the form of a molehill.               If the
asparagus plants should have begun to shoot before their trans
plantation, the young shoots should be cut off, and the planting
will, with these precautions, be equally successful, though it
should be performed in this country even as late as July. Should
any of the plants originally inserted have died, they also may be
replaced at this season.      The plants ought to be two years old
when they are transplanted; they will even take at three; but
at four they are apt to fail.                                           
    If it be necessary to buy asparagus plants for these beds, it
will be proper to procure twice as many as are required.            The
best must then be selected for planting, and the remainder placed
in some remote portion of the prepared bed, or into a similar si
tuation, but without separating the plants.           Mere they must
first be covered with four inches of sand during the summer, and
as soon as the frost sets in, with six inches of dung over that.
    The stems of the planted asparagus must be cut down as soon
 as the frost commences, and close to the ground.         The beds are
then to be covered with six inches of dung, and four of sand.
 In March, the bed must be stirred with a fork, taking care not
 to approach so near to the plants as to derange them. Towards
 the end of April, the plants which have died, may be replaced
with the reserved ones lately described.
     In three years, the largest plants will be fit to cut for use. If
 the beds be sufficiently large to furnish a supply in this manner,
the asparagus shoots should be cut as fast as they appear; other
wise they must be left till the quantity required has pushed foi tfr^
in which case the variety in colour and size prevents them from
having so agreeable an appearance.         An iron knife is used for
this purpose.-
    In cutting, the knife is to  be slipped    along the stem, tilt k
                                                               reaches

414    On Ike Bed    of the German   Ocean and  British Channel,
reaches the bottom of the shoot, where the cut is to be made.
At the end of four years the great and small ones may be taken
indiscriminately.      The cutting should cease about the end of
June.
    At the beginning of winter the stems are all to be cut away,
and the beds covered with dung and sand in the manner above
described.      If muddy sand from the sea-shore can be procured
for the several purposes above described, it is the best; other
wise, river sand may be used ; and if that cannot be procured,
fine earth must be substituted.
    The asparagus bed now described will generally last thirty
 years ; but if they be planted in such abundance as to require
 cutting only once in two .years, half the bed being always in a
state of reservation, it will last a century or more. The turf used
in making the beds should be very free from stones.
    Care must be taken not to tread on the beds, so as to condense
the earth in planting the asparagus ; and to prevent such an ac
 cident happening on any other occasion, a plank should be used
 to tread on.     It must be remembered, that the division of the
 beds, which is formed by thick turf, is intended to prevent the
 condensation of the earth below, in consequence of the neees*
 sary walking among the beds.         As in the course of time this
 condensation will gradually take place, the turf ought to be re
 newed every three years, for the purpose of stirring the ground
 below  and in applying the winter coat of manure, it must be
 remembered, that even these walks are to be covered.        If these
 circumstances are not attended to, or if the earth below the walks
 has not originality been constructed in the way described above,
 the asparagus plants which grow near the walks will be much less
 fine than those in the middle of the beds.
           I understand that this plan has been put in practice by
 Mr. Allan, of Tweedside, with success.
 XCV.      Observations upon the Alveus or General Bed of the
     German Ocean and British Channel, and on the Encroach
     ments   of the Sea on the   Land.    By Mr. Robekt Steven
     son, Civil Engineer, Edinburgh.
 Observations         upon the wasting of the land by the encroach
 ment   of  the sea might, with great propriety, be made upon the
  shores of Ireland, of which I have seen many instances on the
 western, northern, and eastern coasts, from Loch Swilly in the
 County of Donegal, to the Tusker rock off the coast of Wexford.
 But, without enlarging upon these shores, we shall now turn our
                                                            attention

      ami on the Encroachments        of the    Sen on the Land.   A\%
attention to the coast of England, which, with the opposite
shores of Holland and Fiance, form the apices of the German
Ocean and the British Channel. From the more soft and Yield
ing, matters of which these shores are formed, particularlv those
of England, which are at the same time exposed to the violent
attacks of the sea in storms from the north-east and south
western directions, the wasting effects of the sea are altogether
so very remarkable, that it may in general be affirmed that these
shores are in a progressive state of waste.      Beginning with the
jiorth-eastern coast, examples of this will suggest themselves to
the recollection of those who are acquainted with the shores of
Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire'; as at Holy Island,
for example, and the shores near Bamborough Castle, where
the sea has made considerable inroads upon the land, in the re
collection of the present inhabitants of that neighbourhood.
Tyuemouth Castle, situated at the entrance of the river Tyne,
which now in a manner overhangs the sea, had formerly a con
siderable extent of land beyond it.' Tynemouth head, being
composed of a soft sand-stone, is gradually worn away by the
action of the sea and the effects of the weather ; and every sea
son falls down in such quantities, that the degradation is quite
observable to the inhabitants of the town of Tynemouth.       Upon
the southern side of the entrance to the river Tyne many acres
of land have been washed away from the extensive ebb called
 the Middens ; and the same has happened along the whole shores
of the county of Durham, particularly between the rivers Tyne
and Weir, where the coast is chiefly composed of a soft friable
limestone : and indeed the land is obviously in a state of waste
 all the way to the Tees.      On the southern side of the great
sand -hanks, forming the mouth of the Tees, we enter upon the
coast of Yorkshire, which extends to the estuary of the river
,Humber, being upwards of a hundred miles. This coast consists
 chiefly of sandstone and chalk-hills, and exposes a precipitous
face to the sea, which is acting upon     it,
                                           and in many places pro
ducing its rapid destruction  of this many examples are
                              :                                    fa
 miliar to those on the spot, particularly in the neighbourhood of
 Whitby and Scarborough. For few miles both on the northern
                                  a
 and southern side of Flamborough-head      lighthouse, the section
 of the coast is almost perpendicular, and consists of chalk inter
 mixed with portions of clay.    At the eastern extremity, or pitch
 of the head, the chalky cliff about seventy feet in height from
                             is                                :
 this point the coast declines all the way to the town of, Bridling
 ton, and from thence to Dimbleington cliff, near the entrance to
 the Humber,  it   is
                   a low sandy shore. From what has been ahead*
  ...
stated of the effects of the sea upon the hard or more compact
 shores of Scotland,    it
                        is easv to imagine what its operation must

-116   On the Bed   of the German    Ocean and   British Channel,
be on the   line of coast just described : accordingly, the inha
 bitants at Flamborough-head, and indeed all along the York
shire coast, are too often kept in mind of this by the removal of
their landmarks and inclosures ; and there are many traditions
of churches, houses, and whole fields having been overrun by the
sea in the neighbourhood of Hornsea, Kilnsea, and the Spurn-
point light-houses on the northern side of the Humber.            The
widely   extended   mouth  of  this estuary, and the manner  in which
it is cumbered with sand-banks off the coast at Clea and Salt-
fleet in Lincolnshire, and indeed the appearance of the coast all
the way to Boston, shows that much of the land has been swal
lowed up or overrun by the sea ; of which there are many stri
king proofs, both of ancient and modern occurrence.
    The same remarks arc also applicable to the great ebb, called
the Wash, forming the entrance or navigation to the harbours of
Boston and Lynn.          Here it would appear that the sea has
made a breach through the chalk Jiills, which are observable on
each side of the Wash, in the counties of Lincoln and Norfolk,
where it is obvious that the land has at one time extended further
into the sea, and is at present undergoing the process of actual
waste.    Perhaps evidence of this may also be drawn from the
works of William of Malmesbury, who represents the whole of
the fens of Lincoln to have been in a state of high cultivation in
the eleventh century. But certainly a most unequivocal proof of
this is afforded from the discovery of Sir Joseph Banks and Dr.
Joseph Correa, mentioned in the S9th volume of the Philoso
phical Transactions, of the remains of a sub-marine forest on
this coast, now several fathoms under water, where the r,oots,
boles, and branches of trees, particularly of the birch, of large
size, were discovered.      From the account of the fishermen of
this coast, these appearances are to be seen for many miles along
the shore in the form of a range of small islets : and trees have
been ofteli found, the timber of which was so fresh as to be fit
for oeconomical purposes. The inhabitants of the country like-
vrise represent, that at one time the parish-church stood greatly
within the present sea-mark, and that the walls of houses, of a
former village, have been seen at low ebbs; and they allege,
that even the clock of the present parish church, is the same that
was in the church the foundations of which are now overflowed.
It seems therefore probable, that the present state of the fen
country arises from the encroachments of the sea, occasioned by
the silting or filling up to a certain degree of the alveus or bed
of the German ocean, rather than from the gradual retreat or
subsiding of the waters of the ocean ; and that the sea, not
withstanding some, anomalous instances of recession which shall
afterwards be noticed, is invariably trenching upon the land.
                                                          Proceeding

         and on the Encroachments      of the Sea on the  Land.    4 17
     Proceeding southward, we next traverse the coast of Suffolk-
  and Essex, where numerous instances occur of ravages which the
  sea is making upon the shore.      It has already been ascertained,
  that the sand-banks of Yarmouth Roads have of late years consi
  derably altered, and that the depth of water is perhaps upon the
  whole rather lessened ; and some pretty extensive additions have
  been made to the land at the junction of the rivers Aide and But-
  ley in the great gravelly beach which extends about eight or ten
  miles in length, varying in breadth from a few hundred feet to
  about a mile ; and similar appearances are to be found on this
  coast as at Harwich, near the confluence of the rivers Stour and
  Ipswich, where a considerable addition has been made to the
  land on the southern side of Landguardfort : yet these, and other
  examples of the same kind, are trifling in proportion to the as
 tonishing effects of the sea in destroying the land in this very
  neighbourhood.      Near Leostoffe, Dunwich, and Aldborough
 castle,  on the Suffolk  coast, the sea is daily making impressions
  upon the land, which is apparent to the observation of every one
 acquainted in the slightest degree with that coast, and is at some
 places severely felt both by the proprietor and the tenant.        At
 the Naze Tower, near Walton, and indeed all along the coast of
 Essex, the same appearances are no less obvious. ,
     Crossing the numerous sand-banks and shoals which greatly
 encumber the mouth of the river Thames to the Kentish coast,
 we are every where presented with instances of the degradation
 of the land by the encroachment of the sea. From Sbeerness
 along the shore of the isle of Sheppy, and from the entrance of
 the river Swale to Margate and Ramsgate, at various places,
 very large portions of the chalky cliffs are continually giving way
 to the sea. At Sheppy island, Thanet and Sandwich, there are
 proofs of the land gaining somewhat upon the sea : of this the
 Goodwin and other sand-banks may also be considered as ex
 amples.     But these cases, arising from the shape of the coast,
 and the set of particular currents of the tide, are evidences of the
 silting up of the alveus or bed of the ocean, and shall be after
wards alluded to as so many proofs of the consequent tendency
of the sea to overflow its banks. But, to continue, it may further
be noticed, that the streets of Deal are often laid under water ;
and houses there have occasionally been washed down by the sea :
 and, indeed, its effects are very alarming all along this coast.
     At Romney Marshes labourers are const&ntly employed attend
ing and repairing the fences and sea-dikes of these low shores. On
the precipitous shores from Deal to Dover, Folkstone and Hithe,
large portions of the chalk-cliffs are frequently undermined and
carried away ; particularly at the South Foreland and cliffs of
Dover, where I happened to witness the effects of the recent fall,
     Vol. 49. No. 230. June 1S17-             D d               some

  some years ago, of an immense quantity of these extraordinary
  chalk cliffs, the ruins of which appeared to cover several acres
  of ground, and must have contained many thousands of tons.
. A fall of this kind, near Beachyhead,       on the Sussex coast, is
  noticed in a paper by      Mr, Webster in the Transactions of the
  Geological Society.      The portion which gave way extended 300
  feet in length, and was 70 or 80 feet in breadth.        A clergyman
  who: happened     at  the   moment   to be walking   on the spot, ob
  serving the ground giving way, had just     time  to escape when the
  whole fell down with a dreadful crash.       In the same manner the
  opposite coast of France is understood to be acted upon ; and
  the numerous islands lying off that coast and the coasts of Ger
  many and Holland.         I might also extend these observations to
 -the shores of Hampshire, Dorset, Devon, Cornwall, particularly
 -to the isles of Wight and Portland, and the Scilly islands ; the
  wasting of the land and the encroachment of the sea being every
  where remarkable, and always in proportion to the nature of the
  strata or rocks composing the coast, whether alluvial, chalk,
  limestone, sandstone, or granite.
      Nor are these effects of the sea confined to the shores of the
  German Ocean and the British Channel ; for the wasting of the
  land is no less remarkable in St. George's Channel and the Irish
  Sea, including the coast of Ireland on the one side, and, on the
  other, ,the shores of Wales, Lancashire, Westmoreland, and the
  counties of Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, and Galloway, where nei
  ther the rocky coasts, and exposed situations of the islands of
  Anglesea, Man, Copland, Craig of Ailsa, and the islands of Cum-
  brae, nor the sheltered and alluvial shores of the Bristol Channel,
  are exempted : even the indentations of the coast at Dublin Bay,
  Liverpool, and Lancaster, and the more extensive friths of the
  Solway and the Clyde, are subject to the unvarying destructive
  effects of the sea.
      Having pointed out, from actual observation on about one-half
  of the coast of Ireland, and on all parts of the shores of Great
  Britain, from the Scilly islands, its southern extremity, to the
  Naze of Unst, or northernmost point of Shetland, that the land,
  on the margin of the sheltered bays and friths of our coast, as
  well as on the most exposed promontories and open shores, is un
  dergoing the process of waste and decay from the impulse and
  action of the sea, I shall in a future paper endeavour to show,
  that the cause of this effect, particularly on the shores of the
  German Ocean and British Channel, is, in a good measure, ow
  ing to the immense quantity of debris which must be accumu
   lating, at least to a certain depth, in the bottom of the ocean.
      This paper is circulated, with a view of obtaining additional
   facts regarding the wasting of the shores of Great Britain and
                                                                   those

The     finest-grained charcoal that can be procured is sawed into
slips of the size and form required, and put into a pipkin of
melted bees'-wax, where they are permitted to remain near a
slow fire for half an hour or more, in proportion to the thickness
of the charcoal : they are then takeu out, and, when perfectly
cool, are fit for use. By adding a small quantity of rosin to the
wax, they may be made considerably harder; and on the con
trary, should they be required softer, a little butter or tallow will
answer the purpose.      The advantages these pencils possess are,
that they can be made at the most trifling expense, and at any
time ; and that drawings made with them are as permanent as
ink, and not liable to injury by being rubbed, or remaining in
the damp. ,
    The above process will harden both red and black chalks,
 and make them permanent also.

          of   the   respirutnry Organs. By A Correspondent.
  -Pi*e successful experiments of Dr. W. Philip and the Wor*
 cester practitioners should have attracted more attention from
 medical inquirers than they appear to have hitherto done. The
 phenomena of galvanism are yet very imperfectly known; and
'many may still be discovered by multiplying experiments in this
  department of science, and particularly its application to the
, animal   oeconomy.     It is, however, a general propensity of the
.day   to expect  a complete and perfect renovation of a vitiated
  constitution merely by the application of some one potent drug;
.  -an expectation,   perhaps, not less injurious to the progress of
  *eience (so far as it is concerned with medical practice) than the
  obsolete notions of blending together almost all the known drugs
  into a single dose. Hence, it is probable, that as the application
  of galvanism to the respiratory organs has not wrought any mi-

racks, nor instantaneously either killed or cured, its use has been
almost entirely neglected.      Perhaps, also, a certain degree of
reluctance in patients to bear its action, may have contributed to
retard its general application. It must, indeed, be confessed that
it requires some patience and resolution to bear the smarting
sensations occasioned by the application of the Galvanic wires to
the nape of the neck and the chest.           A few minutes of the
weakest battery and conducting wires armed with silver knobs
 are generally sufficient to blister the parts to which they are di
rectly applied.     This effect takes place even when the skin is
 shielded by pieces of tinfoil, and the consequent smarting pain
 Sometimes intimidates debilitated patients.      In persons of gross
 habits, these blisters have been known to remain open for several
 weeks after they had been galvanized, and have ultimately proved
 highly salutary to/ the general health of the patient ; in others,
 they healed as rapidly as common blisters.      But it does not ap
 pear   that any   effects prejudicial to the constitution have yet
followed the administration of galvanism ; and it is certain that
 in many diseases it has a tendency to exhilarate patients, and
 might be very advantageously applied to melancholy persons.
 Out of five asthmatic persons galvanized by the writer of this,
 four have experienced very considerable relief; one has passed
 above nine months without experiencing any painful or even
 irksome effects in breathing ; three others are attacked only in
 consequence of exposing themselves to sudden and violent trans
 itions of temperature, but now in a much less degree than for
 merly; and another seemed to acquire additional energy and
 spirits, but very little melioration in his breathing.
     In the course of these experiments some curious facts were
 observed.    It was found that all the patients suffered more from
 the application of the wires when only half an inch or an inch of
 the Galvanic trough was covered with the acidulated water, than
 when the whole trough, consisting of two or of four inch plates,
 was filled.    Very few persons could during the first minute
 bear more than six two-inch plates when less than half covered
 with the diluted acid ; but when each plate was moistened to
 nearly its edge, then they could generally suffer four times the
 number.     This apparently contradictory effect may be easily ex
 plained, by considering the necessity of atmospheric air to every
 Galvanic operation.       If a battery composed of fixed plates be
 entirely covered with acidulated water, it has no Galvanic action ;
 but whenever the atmosphere is allowed to act on the moistened
 metal, then its powers develop themselves.          In like manner,
 when only the bottom part of the trough was moistened, and
 the communication made by rapidly pouring in a slender stream
 the acidulated water along the top of the battery, a greater por

tion of the plates was exposed to the atmosphere,        and conse
quently their action was too powerful for patients to endure.
This fact may perhaps suggest the propriety of constructing
Galvanic batteries in a manner not hitherto attempted, if not
for chemical at least for medical purposes.        It is indeed un
questionable that we are still unacquainted with many of the
operations and powers of galvanism, and their relations to elec
trical phenomena; and a modification of the apparatus so as to
present a greater surface to the atmosphere, in the same manner
as it is necessary to connect an electrical machine with the earth,
may perhaps contribute to augment the powers of this extraor
dinary implement of philosophical research.        From a few ex
periments, which however were not sufficiently numerous to war
rant a legitimate deduction, it appears probable that broad plates
might be used to galvanize patients without blistering the parts
so rapidlv or exciting so much pain.

                               Society.
                            Introduction.
G eology      relates to the knowledge of the system of our earth,
of the arrangements of its solid, fluid, and aeriform parts, their
mutual agencies, and the laws of their changes.
   In this point of view, it 'is necessarily connected with many
branches of Natural Science, but it is more particularly depend
ent upon Mineralogy, which distinguishes the species of inorganic
bodies ; and upon Chemistry, which investigates the intimate
nature of matter and its hidden properties.
   Geology in its comprehensive sense is consequently a sublime
and difficult science ; but fortunately for its progress it is sus
ceptible of division into many different departments, several of
which are capable of being extended by mere observation.
   The knowledge of the general and grand arrangements of
Nature must be collected from a number of particular and mi
nute instances, and on this ground the slightest information re
lating to the structure of the earth is to be regarded as of some
importance.  To reduce Geology to a system demands a total
devotion of time, and an acquaintance with almost every branch
of experimental and general Science, and can be performed only
by philosophers ; but the facts necessary to this great end may
be collected without much labour, and by persons attached to
various pursuits and occupations ; the principal requisites being
minute observation and faithful record.  The Minery theQuarrier,

the directions of rivers, and the nature of lakes and waters, they
are worthy of being noticed.
   It is with a view to facilitate and in some measure to direct
general research, that the members of the Geological Society have
collected from different sources and put together the annexed
inquiries ; and, as insulated remarks and local information can
be of no avail, unless preserved and arranged, they venture to
offer a repository for any facts that may be communicated to
them.     One great end of their association is to afford means by
which this kind of knowledge mav be concentred; and they con
ceive that by the labours and talents of many individuals thus
united and assisted, several important objects may be easily at
tained ; -that Mineralogical maps of districts, which are now so
much wanting, may be supplied ; that the nomenclature of the
science may be gradually amended by the selection of the most
current and significant terms ; that theoretical opinions may be
compared with the appearances of Nature, and above all, a fund
of practical information obtained applicable to purposes of public
improvement and utility.  They address themselves more espe
cially to their countrymen, and they cannot conclude without
noticing the extraordinary facility of obtaining Geological in
formation, afforded by the territory of the British Isles, and the
peculiar interest which ought to be attached by their inhabitants
to such inquiries.     In no equal space is so great a surface of
the earth laid bare by Nature and by art ; no country is richer
in those mineral productions on which some of the most impor
tant of our manufactures, and the most useful of the arts of life
depend; and the present time is one in which we are particularly
called upon to explore and employ the whole of our native riches

   XCIX. Memoir         on the Poison    of the Viper.     By Professor
                                  Mangili*.
 The       ancients believed that the poison of the viper when intro
 duced directly into the alimentary canal, was not productive of
 any injurious effect to the animal oeconomy. They grounded this
belief on the fact, that a person may with impunity suck a wound
 inflicted by this animal ; and this was even prescribed as one of
 their remedies.       The same opinion was adopted by Redi.
     More lately Fontana maintained that though a small dose of
 poison might be imbibed without danger, a greater dose would
 produce the most serious consequences  even death.                  He lulled
 eight vipers,     and extracting  all the  venom   out of them, he intro
 duced it into the stomach of a pigeon which had not eaten for
 eight hours before.       In less than a minute the animal appeared
 sickened; at the end of two other minutes it began to stagger,
 fell on its side, and died in six minutes in strong convulsions.
     This experiment was contrary to one made by Redi, who,
 having diluted in a glass of water some poison extracted from the
  heads of four vipers, and having given a part of it to a kid, and
 the rest to a water-dog, no sort of harm resulted from it.
     At last Jacob Sozzi drank with equal impunity the poison of
 a viper diluted in half a glass of wine ; at another time he drank
 in the same manner the poison of three vipers.
     With the desire of clearing up this matter, the author of this
  memoir made at first experiments on four young blackbirds.
  The first swallowed the venomous fluid of three vipers; the se
 cond that of four ;  the third that of five ;  and the fourth that

of six.     For some time they appeared plunged in a state of
stupor and inertness; but scarcely had one hour elapsed before
they showed themselves as vivacious and hearty as before.
   So convincing were these experiments to one of the assistants,
that he swallowed all the poison which could be extracted from
four other large vipers, and was not in the least affected by it.
   The following year the experiment was repeated on a crow
after a fast of twelve hours, and it swallowed without injury the
venom of six vipers.
   In the month of October IS 14 (continues the author of the
memoir) I made seven large vipers discharge all their venom
into one dish, and immediately dipped into it four small pieces
of bread, which were swallowed by a pigeon.          At first he ap
peared languid, but in a short time became as well as before.
Some days after I inserted into one of his feet, as also into those
of another pigeon, a small particle of very dry venom, which had
been preserved for four months in a glass phial well corked up.
Both of them soon gave manifest signs of being poisoned, and
died at about the end of two hours.
   Another pigeon swallowed all the venom which ten of the
largest vipers could furnish,without presenting the least symptom
of being poisoned.
   Fontana alleged that the dry poison        does not preserve its
poisonous properties beyond nine months.          This assertion was
founded on experiments in which there was a possibility that the
poison introduced into the wound might not have been retained,
but expelled again with the flow of blood; and it is besides com
pletely refuted by the following experiments of the author of this
memoir.       On poison preserved carefully for eighteen months,
twenty-two months, and even twenty-six months, being intro
duced into the feet of several pigeons, they all died within half
 an hour or an hour.      To secure the retention of the poison, the
 author immediately on inserting it stopped up the wound with
 a little lint.    The result of these experiments completely de
 monstrates the error of Fontana's assertion, and proves that the
 poison of the viper preserved with proper care may retain for
 many years its destructive properties.

   natural phenomena.        For this purpose observers register facts,
   and philosophers infer the causes from the phenomena by a lo
   gical process of induction.
       The design of the present essay is to determine the causes of
   all those phenomena, on which philosophical observers have
   hitherto conferred the name of Gravitation or Attraction, and
   which is vulgarly designated by the name of Weight.       Owing to
   what cause or causes does a body fall to the earth ?  Why does
   a projectile return to the earth ?  These are the questions which


   it is here proposed to answer.
       The Newtonians, and all the modern schools of philosophy,
   have been unable to solve these problems ; or, finding themselves
   unable, they have been unwilling to discuss them, or even tolerate
   their discussion : while the Theologians have been desirous of re
   ferring this power to the proximate agency of the Deity.       It is,
   however, the duty of genuine philosophers to persevere in spite
   of difficulties and obscurities ; and of wise theologians to exalt
   their notions of the Deity by contemplating the sublime and
   simple mechanism of secondary causes.
       In the present case, the phenomena consist in the apparent
   influence of one body upon another, though they are not in con-
 , tact, and though    no visible, mechanical agency appears to exist
. between them ; and in their approach to each other by certain
   laws of accelerated motion, as a result of apparently continued
 '
   and reiterated forces.
       What, however, are the circumstances in which the bodies so
 , acting upon each other are placed, as in the case of a stone pro
  jected from, or falling to, the earth ? The Earth is a globe of
   heterogeneous materials, moving round the sun in every year, at
 -such distance, that its mean rate of motion, in round numbers,
   is 100,000 feet in a second of time; and the stone moves with
   the earth in the same orbit, partaking conjointly with it of the
   ^ame mean motion of 100,000 feet in every second.          Nor will
    any one doubt that, at the time the earth and atmosphere are
    performing this orbicular motion, they are also performing a ro
    tary motion in every twenty-four hours, which rotary motion
   carries bodies on the earth's surface through a space, at the
    equator, of 1250 feet in a second, or one-eightieth of the orbi
   cular motion.
       The whole earth, then, with all bodies upon the earth, and
    the atmosphere, are subject to these combined motions and
    forces ; and, in this passive state, the questions are : by what
 . law or laws the heterogeneous particulars      are kept together ?
    and how, if the positions are disturbed, those positions are re
   stored ?
                                                               Suppose

      Suppose A to be a place on the earth's surface, from which, by
  muscular or explosive force, a stone is projected towards D, at
 sixteen feet and an inch above A. Suppose that a second of time
  elapses while the stone is ascending from A to D, then it is evi
  dent that the point A will in that second be carried forward, by
  the orbicular motion of the earth, 100,000 feet, or to C ; that
 is to say, the point A will move 100,000 feet while the ball is
  ascending sixteen feet and an inch : consequently the ball will,
  in truth, not ascend in space from A to D, but will be carried
  in an oblique line from A to E, moving upwards as it proceeds.
  The two forces  that which carries it from A to C, and that
 which carries it towards D,  are as 100,000 to 16-tVj or as 6000
 to 1 nearly.
      The stone having arrived at E, it is then known, by the phe
 nomenon, to fall to the earth in a second of time ; yet it does
 not fall through EC, but, while falling, is carried, by the orbi
 cular motion, through 100,000 feet to B, in the diagonal EB.
     Such a diagonal course as AE is therefore, in point of fact,
 generated by every projectile, while it is rising to any given height
 in the atmosphere ; but, as the spectator is carried with the pro
jectile, he merely measures its novel and peculiar motions, and
 is incapable of observing the orbicular motion, of which he par
 takes in common with the projectile.           The projectile is not,
however, the less subject to the force of the orbicular motion,
because it is not perceived or felt by a spectator at rest ; but, as
 a body put into motion by novel forces, acting in apposing di
rections, its novel state of opposing motion is liable to be affected
by all opposing forces simultaneously existing in nature; and,
when its novel force is exhausted or destroyed at E, it becomes
the patient of the great natural forces, which, in moving the
earth and atmosphere from A to B, move it likewise, as part of
the system.
     The projectile having however ascended to E, a difficulty arises
in regard to the origin of the force which deflects it from the
summit at E towards B.        Why does it not move for ever in the
parallel DE ? What is the original force that turns it aside ? Is
that force required to be equal to the weight of the body; or
what proportion of that force, and how is it generated ?
     It appears by the fact that the whole force which was neces
sary to cause it to fall through the 1G-V feet, is but a 6000dth
part of the orbicular momentum ; consequently the deflection of
16 feet forms but an angle of 20 seconds at A and at B.           The
                                                               nascent

  Effects   of the Orbicular  and 'Rotary Motions  of the Earth. 433
 nascent deflection, however, at E would be but an infinitesimal
 of the said 20    seconds ; consequently, any indefinitely small de
 flective force, arising from new combinations of the forces, might
 be sufficient to return a body to the earth.
     What then is the actual deflective force which turns a projec
 tile downward, and prevents it from moving for ever in the place
 in the atmosphere in which it has been left by the extinction of
 that projectile force, which carried it from the surface into so
 novel a situation in the atmosphere ?
     Let us examine all the circumstances in which the body has
 been placed : 
     1.  It was moving    with the earth in its orbit with all olhet
 bodies upon the earth,     and therefore possessed a momentum- in
 that direction, which, with regard to other bodies, was as their
 (jziantities of matter.
     2. // was deflected aside by some novel muscular or explosive
force, and thrown towards D.
     3. But, while it was moving towards D, or 16 feet and an
 inch, it was carried 6000 times as far, or 100,000y"ee£ at right
  angles; and therefore performed a diagonal.
     4. At C it loses its force in the direction at D, and is de
fected towards the earth, at B.
     Let us now examine what other circumstances have attended
 its ascent : 
     1 . Its passage has been made in a resisting medium, which
 tended, as is known, constantly to destroy the force with which
 it was projected from A towards D.
     2. During its ascent the point A, and every point of the dia
 gonal AE, were also performing a rotary circular motion round
 the centre of the earth.
     3. The point A would therefore be deflected downward, du
 ring its passage towards C,Jrom A below C; so that D would
 also be deflected below E, and the entire line AE would be de
flected, or turned downward, belotv AC.
    4. The rotary motion would therefore have the effect of de
flecting the body below the diagonal AE, at every increment of
 its ascent.
     5. The constant resistance of the atmosphere would, in like
 manner, deflect it.
     6. The body would, therefore, be subject, during its ascent,
 to the action of four jbrcis :
     a, the orbicular force.
     b, the projectile force.
     c, the rotary force.
     d, the resisting force.           ;

strayed each other, the body is then surrendered to the joint- ac
tion of the orbicular force and the rotary force.
   8. And we have seen that it is the effect of the rotary force
to deflect it from the right line of the orbicular force towards
the earth.
   Consequently it is the rotation of the earth and atmosphere,
p.eting simultaneously with the annual motion, which produces
the deflection of bodies from the right line of their orbicular
                -
motion; but the circular rotation has another important effect
on the masses of various density which compose the earth, and
which, as subject to a common force, would have different orbi
cular velocities, but for the effect of their common rotary motion
in circles of different radii*.
   To the rotary motion of the earth                    is,
                                              therefore, to be referred
that uniformity in the velocity of bodies of various density, which
enables the whole to keep an equal and uniform pace in the or
bit of the earth.         this rotary motion which reduces to order,
                            It   is
what otherwise would be chaos.         Hence          that all fluids are
                                                               it   is

exactly proportioned to the relations of density.
   We know, from the diurnal phenomena, that the earth and
atmosphere have such a common rotary motion              and we know,    ;
from their common orbicular force, that the whole have unequal
momenta.      It      is,
                      however, a necessary mechanical effect of                           a
common rotary motion, producing, of course, equal momenta in
masses of various density that they range themselves, or seek to
range themselves, in concentric circles, or radii of rotation, in
versely, as their respective densities.     The lighter bodies will be
projected from the centre towards the circumference, and the
   * It seems extraordinary that, although the two-fold motion of the earth
has so long been known and admitted, no mechanical effects should
have been considered as arising among its parts from the operation of those
motions; and that one motion should have been considered as having no
other end than the alternation of seasons,and the other none but the chanties
of day and night. It     true that these are some of the ends resulting from

 heavy ones will be forced towards the centre by their mutual col
 lisions.   Such will be the law, governing all the masses that are
 free,  to move  one among another, as the fluid parts and the
 moving or moveable parts.        It is a law growing out of the con
 ditions, and the conditions are those which exist in Nature.         If
 a projectile, therefore, have a specific density equal to the air or
 fluid into which it has risen, it will be carried round the earth in
the concentric circle of that stratum, because the momenta are
 there equal : but, if it be lighter than the air, it will then be re
 flected by the denser strata, till its own momentum, and the mo
menta of the surrounding air, be equal ; while, on the other
 hand, if it be heavier than the circumambient air or fluid, then
 the air or fluid will rise over it and deflect it to the earth, with a
force which will be nearly in the ratio of their densities.
     Galileo was the first geometrician who analysed the pheno
 mena of falling bodies, and determined the law of their motions.
 He was followed in this theory by Newton, and his doctrines are
justly respected to this day. That great man considered, how
ever, that bodies thrown perpendicularly upward, merely describe
in rising and falling the same straight line. He was one of the
 most powerful advocates of the two-fold motions of the earth ;
 yet he never considered bodies acted upon by a temporary and
 relative projectile force, as still subject to the absolute two-fold
 motions of the earth and atmosphere.         Hence he considered the
 force which returned the body to the earth, as equal in small di
 stances to the weight of the body, and as acting in right lines
 from the centre of the earth.       In this notion he was borne out.
 by the belief in all kinds of sympathies and emanations which
 characterized his age, as well as that of Newton; and to these
 superstitions may, doubtless, be referred the doctrine of an ema
 nating gravity.     It appears, however, that, as a body subject to
 the novel force of an upright projectile, does not, in truth, de
 scribe a perpendicular line, but two sides of an exceedingly obtuse
triangle ; no force is requisite to deflect it to the earth, but the
exceedingly small one which creates the nascent deflection.
 Hence, as the angle of deflection required to carry a body through
-the first inch, is not the 2000dth part of a degree ; the deflective
 force need not be more than the 120,000dth part of the perma
 nent momentum of the body created by the orbicular force: and
  consequently no difficulty arises in referring the small deflective
 force to the combinations of the great motions of our planet.

436.    The Vhcenomena    of Gravitation  proved to be proximate
    Suppose E to be the earth ; AB a portion of its orbit ; F a
 place on the earth's surface ; C a stratum of the atmosphere
 which a projectile has reached-; ab a parallel of the orbit, and
 DE a tangent of the atmosphere ; then it is evident that, whether
 the earth is turning from D towards E, or fiom E towards D. a
 deflection, from the orbicular motion to the rotary, would take
 place, measured by such an angle as DCa, or ACE, in either case
 creating a direction of force opposed to that in the orbit, and
 producing a resistance in the next superior atmosphere, and
 creating a deflection downward fully equal to the known phe
 nomena, which requires for the first deflection but an infinitely
 small portion of an angle of 20 seconds.
     It is also evident that the common rotary motion of the earth
 and atmosphere would confer a greater velocity on the circle C
 than the circle F, and so in every circle from C to F, the space*
 described being as the squares of the radii, or as the squares of
 the distances from E. To confer, however, an equal momentum
 on the mass, it is necessary that the densities from C to E should
 be inversely as the velocity, or inversely as the spaces, or in
 versely as the squares of the radii.
     Moreover, as by the phenomena, the momenta in every con
  centric stratum or circle of rotation are known to be equal, so
  any mass of equal density would in different circles, or at different
  distances, be carried or impelled in the vortex by the circum
  ambient media, or incumbent bodies, through spaces, which
  would be to each other, inversely as the squares of the distutice
  froth the centre, and directly as the resistance of the medium in
  which they move.
     Consequently, the collision of the bodies or masses of different
  densities, in the terrestrial system, will force or urge the heaw
  bodies towards the centre, and of course, also, the light ones to
  wards the circumference  circumstance* which we know accord

   The following illustrations and observations may tend to make
these principles perfectly dear, and to remove all doubts.
   1. The projectile at its apex, when deprived of the projectile
force, is still immersed within the atmosphere, and is carried, or
urged, by the atmosphere, in the direction of the circular rota
tion of the atmosphere.
    '&.That circular rotation then produces, or solicits to produce,
 (with    aforce proportioned to the relative densities of the at
mosphere and projectile,)      deflection of the said. projectile from
                                        a
the right line of the orbicular motion, into the direction of the
circular motion at the place of contact.
   3.    the density of the projectile were equal to the density of
          If
the atmosphere, then the projectile would float in the atmo
sphere, and be carried round the earth in the circular vortex of
the earth, like the atmosphere itself.
    4.    If   were denser than the atmosphere, then the rotary
               it
momentum of the lighter atmosphere being less than the rotary
momentum of the projectile, resistance would be generated equal
to the difference of their rotary momenta and a deflection of
                                                         ;

    5.     the projectile were lighter than the atmosphere, then
          If
the momentum of the circumjacent atmosphere would be greater
than that of the projectile, and the projectile would, in conse

stantly accelerated motion, so as        bodies   fall       by
                                                           the  action   of a
continued deflective force, they are necessarily accelerated during
 their fall, till they rest on the fixed parts of the earth.             But,
 as is   found      experiment, the increased resistance of the air,
                         by
 arising from the increased motion, will occasion                balance of
                                                                  a

    9. As every successive circle, from the centre to the utmost
bounds of the . atmosphere, in performing the diurnal rotation,
contains bodies of such density, that the density multiplied by
the motion is equal ; so no body of undue density would remain
in a circle of rotation which created in it too great or too small
a relative momentum, provided, as in fluids, the parts were free
to move one among another ; and, if they were not free to move,
as in fixed organizations, then they would exhibit the pheno-
mena of pressure, or would appear, in regard to other bodies, to
solicit to ascend or descend, as the case might be.           Probably
to this conflict of light and heavy bodies, to the generation of
light bodies in undue positions, and to the varied action of fixed
and fluid matter, may be referred most of the phenomena of
terrestrial organizations; and, as the whole grows out of the
two-fold motion of the earth, so we thus refer the origin of all
 things and phenomena to the agency of motion.
    It follows, therefore, that, the velocity of all the parts and de
pendencies of the earth being alike, the momentum of every part
is directly as its quantity of matter ; consequently, momentum
is weight; and the velocity of 100,000 feet per second in the
direction of the tangents of the orbit being so much greater than
the ordinary, or even extraordinary forces applied to move bodies
in any novel direction, the phenomenon called by the name of
 Gravitation is a necessary result of a preponderating, coincident
 motion in another direction, all contrary or foreign motions be
 ing ultimately destroyed by the resisting medium of the atmo
 sphere and the deflective circular motion.
    The weight of bodies, then, acts on the same principle as their
 momentum in the orbit of the earth, because every force which
 exhibits the phaenomena of weight affects the paramount orbi
 cular force; and, this 'active principle     is, there/ore, merely a
 phcentime'ion resulting from    the orbicular momentum,     regulated
 by  the iotary motion; which rotary motion causes all bodies to
 perform circuits inversely as their quantities of matter, and which
 circuits are proportioned to the distance from the centre.
    The phenomena of weight and gravitation, and of falling
                                                                bodies,

Effects of the Orbicular and Rotary Motions          of the Earth. 439
bodies, may therefore be considered as a result of the composi
tion of forces produced by the annual and diurnal motions of
the earth and its adjuncts.        Of course, all the motions and laws
of projectiles are subordinate to these, and are included within
them.
     On a small scale, the principle may be illustrated by experi
ments of analogous phenomena, in which it will appear that any
lateral motion of bodies produces the same results as the earth
itself ; and that, as a consequence of every such lateral motion,
the projectiles from such bodies respect, in falling, the bodies
whence they are projected, though no suspicion or allegation of
attraction can, in such cases, be adduced.
     Thus, as it is well known, a ball projected from a ship in mo
tion falls at the place whence it rose, though, during its iiscent
and descent, the ship proceeded many yards.           The ball, though
 detached from the ship, respected the ship, during its flight and
 fall, exactly as though it had been attracted by the ship. It can
not, however, be contended that such phaenomena are results of
 the ship's attraction ! The effect arises merely from the ship's
 lateral motion having been acquired by the ball previously to its
 projection ; the case being exactly the same as that of a ball
 projected above the earth, to which it falls again, on the very
 principle on which it fell on the ship, not by the attraction either
 of the ship or the earth, but because the earth's lateral motion,
 like the lateral motion of the ship, had been acquired by the
  ball.
      So,  alsOj when a man, during feats     of horsemanship, throws
  up oranges     in his course, he readily catches them again, though
  during their flight he advanced many yards, because his lateral
  motion had previously been given to the oranges ; and in con
  sequence, in falling again, they respected him just as though,
  according to pre-existing notions about the earth, he had at
  tracted them.
      In like manner, if a ball be dropped from the top of the mast
  of a ship, which at the time was moving at any given rate, the
  ball will fall perpendicularly at the foot of the mast, exactly as
   though the ship had been standing still ; and will thus appear
  to be influenced by the ship, and not by the earth, exactly as a
  ball let to fall from a tower falls to the earth, and appears to
   respect the earth. In both cases, the phaenomena are regular and
   necessary consequences of the composition of motion ; and there
   is no unseen or occult power, called attraction, concerned in one
   case more than in the other.

     If   a  be projected from A perpendicularly towards D, and
              ball
A    be supposed to be on the deck of a ship, which is moving at
 any given rate, from the part A towards the part B ; then the
 ball, instead of ascending to the point of space at D, will, with
out material error, move in the diagonal AC, by the compound
forces which, in the same time, would have carried it to D or F ;
 and in descending it will fall to the deck at B, to which the
point A, in the interim, has advanced. It has in truth performed,
instead of an apparent perpendicular, the two sides of the tri
 angle, or the curve ACB ; and instead of falling at the point of
 space A, whence it was projected, it has advanced with the ship,
 and fallen at the point of space B, to which A. has advanced ;
 and in falling has respected the ship, and not the point of space,
or the earth at A. It was not however attracted by the ship,
but merely impelled in the diagonal by the motion of the ship,
in which it previously participated.
    These cases fully illustrate the principle for which I contend ;
but, of course, the relations and powers of the ship, and man
moving on the moving earth, are included within the more ex
tensive relations and powers operating in Nature, in the pro
digious forces generated by the annual and diurnal motions of
our planet.    The case of a body thrown upward frorti a ship in
motion, merely shows that, in falling, it obeys a law growing out
of the motion of the ship ; in like manner as bodies projected
from the earth, or falling towards     it,
                                        obey   asimilar law of motion
growing    out of similar  motions  of the  earth.   The law in both
cases     is
          a mere result of the composition of motion, and not an
effect of any occult or mysterious power.
    These examples, and others that might be adduced, serve,
however, to prove the exact analogy of the powers, the phpeno-
mena, and the results.       No experiments     in physical philosophy
seem to afford more conclusive analogical proofs of doctrines re
lative to any natural operations, which are too vast to be viewed
by   man on their great scale.
   The recognition of the principles of this paper mav be ex
pected to lead to more precision in the doctrines of projectiles.
Many incomprehensible irregularities in Dr. Hutton's and Mr.
Ilobins's experiments on gunnery may be found to arise from the
contrariety, opposition, or neutrality^ of the direction of the ro
                                                                      tary

Rffects   of the Orbicular   and Rotary Motions       of the Earth.   441
tary motion, in relation to that of the orbicular motion.   It will
likewise be found that periodical fluctuations in the weight, and
 deflections of the atmosphere and other fluids, may be traced to
periodical variations in the relative directions of the mechanical
forces, as in the tides, monsoons, trade-winds, &c.
    To. extend these principles to the solution of the phenomena
of Nature, and to deduce from them all the results of which they
are susceptible, would be, in regard at least to nomenclature, to
remodel the " Principia" of Newton, and to arrange a new sy
stem of physics.
   Nevertheless, I feel it proper to state, that these demonstra
tions of the true and necessary causes of the phenomena hitherto
ascribed to an unknown power, called by the name of Gravitation,
merely fill some important connecting terms in the series of me
chanical causes ascertained by modern philosophy ; while they
disturb none of the known relations of bodies, as determined by
experiment and observation, or by the geometrical and analytical
investigations, of Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Newton, Euler,          La
 Grange, Herschel, or Laplace.
A   Summary of these doctrines may, perhaps, without material
   error, or omission, be expressed in the following paragraphs :
    1. That bodies moved in the annual orbit of any planet, ac
quire a momentum in the direction of the increments of that
orbit superior to the influence of any other permanent force
which is communicated to them.
    2. That all variations in the direction of this orbicular motion
are effected by deflections of that paramount motion, either by
the rotary diurnal motion, or by some muscular, mechanical, or
 chemical force.
    3. That the resistance which bodies exhibit in being lifted, or
thrown, or in any way turned into any new direction, is the mea
sure of their weight, which is as their quantity of matter, be
cause it arises from a velocity common to the terrestrial system
in the direction of the orbit.
    4. That the phenomena of falling bodies are produced by the
deflection of the circular rotary motion from the comparatively
straight line of the orbicular motion.
    5. That every body which has had any new direction of force
given to   it,    nevertheless subject to the permanent influence of
                 is
the pre-existing orbicular and rotary forces in the lines of their
direction, and the resulting line of motion      isthe effect of all the
operative    forces.
    6. That the phenoinenon of the ascent and descent of bodies
is  also influenced   by the resistance of the medium through which
 its novel direction of motion has forced   it  to proceed.
     7. The force with which the deflection by the rotary motion
                                                                       is

  442                  Mr, Farey' * extended     Scale
  is produced, is as the density of the
                                           body deflected to the density
  of the medium in which it moves, and in the inverse ratio
                                                                     of the
  squares of the distance from the centre.
      8. That it is the necessary
                                     tendency of the rotary motion to
  give an equal momentum to the heterogeneous masses
                                                                   compo
  sing a planet and its atmosphere, while the whole are
                                                                    moving
  with an equal velocity in the orbit.
      9. That all phenomena of motion visible to
                                                         beings who par
  take of the common motions of a
                                           planetary system, are either
  the relative motions of distant orbs, or the
                                                       disturbance of the
  great common motions by uew directions of motion produced
                                                                         by
  some muscular, mechanical, explosive, or chemical
                                                             force.
      10. That these temporary and novel directions
                                                              of force and
  motion are speedily extinguished by the great
                                                        permanent forces
  moving in other directions, all traceable to the phenomena, and
 producing compositions of motion which result from the known
 laws of dynamics.
      11. That of course similar motions
                                              produce similar pheno-
 mena in all planetary bodies.
      12. That, therefore, the phenomenon hitherto
                                                            ascribed to an
 occult power called gravitation, is a
                                           simple result of known mo
 tions.
     The application of these principles to the
                                                        phenomena of a
 system of bodies moving within the gaseous medium of
                                                                 universal
 space, will be the object of some future
                                                paper.

                              To Mr. Tilloch.
Sir,      It has  been truly remarked, that, "
                                                     By stopping in the
investigation of any subject, short of its
                                               thorough or general in
vestigation, we are liable to fall into the
                                               error, of mistaking par
ticular cases, for general facts, and of
                                               too soon drawing con
clusions, which on more matured
                                       consideration, require to be re
called or amended."        Thus it has in a small degree
with regard to one of the positions                            happened,
                                        respecting the Euharmonic or
Listonian Scale of Musical Intervals, in
                                             my paper on the Nomen
clature of these Intervals, which
                                      you did me the favour to insert
                                                                        in

in p. 364 of your last number       :  Wherein, after assigning the
symbol t%i to the Interval S3£ + 2f+7m, I have mentioned, that
the same is always the value of a double sharp (**), or a double
flat (bb) ;  which last, although true in all the instances of a Sharp
added to a Sharp, or a Flat to a Flat, as C to C**, and Cb to
CbJ (or three times flattened), &c. yet it fails in a very few other
cases of Mr. Liston's Scale : because, from an extension of his
Euharmonic Scale of Intervals, so as to produce a Note corre
sponding to every one of the 612 Artificial Commas, into which
the 2's of my Notation divides the Octave* (which extension
I have effected, since the paper referred to was written) I have
lately found, that the following Intervals, viz. between C* and
Cb, between C ' and C b, between C"* and C"b, between C'3* (or
three times acuted) and C^b, and between C'-!* and C'4b ; also
between C* and Cb, between Cv,# and C'b, between CVi* (or
three times graved) and Csb, between C4* and CJb, and be
tween C;* and C5b, are each of the value 2l, or 2-3> = 942: + 2f
 -+-8m. respectively;    but in all other instances, of this very ex
tended new Scale, the values of double Sharps, or double Flats,
or of the sums of single Flats and single Sharps, of the same
Notes (as from G* to Gb, D* to Db, &c.) is the Tone minimum,
or S32-|-2f-)-7in, as has been stated, in the page referred to, but
without these qualifications, of its general application, here given.
    The happy discovery, by Mr. Liston, of a Tuning process,
which, by help of perfect major Thirds, Fifths, and Octaves only,
is found capable of giving any required extension to the Scale,
still preserving throughout the same, a true harmonic relation to
the note first assumed, or C (as mentioned in p. 421 of your 39th
volume, and which the late Mr. Maxwell failed in effecting) has
led me to the arrangement, of the extended scale here spoken of,
in a Table, composed of numerous small squares, which has the
effect of exhibiting its many curious properties, in a very striking
manner. The bulk of this table is too considerably extended, by the
many squares in the opposite corners of the sheet, which are un
filled, for it to seem probable, that you could give thisTable a place
in your Magazine ; otherwise, for the sake of the insight which it

(except in the centre, the 7 above-mentioned) will be found to
cross diagonally,. from the top right-hand corner to the left-hand
lower corner, of the large manuscript Table I am describing.
   I beg to recommend to Musical Students, the useful exercise,
of filling up a Table of these 612 equal Notes, from what is here
said: by the study of which, a more perfect insight into the
true relation of the Musical Scale, will be had, than by any other
means: especially that which is usually resorted to by Teachers
and Professors of Music, for explaining the derivation and nature
of the general Scale, by means of the major and minor Tones
and Semitone, or T(104), t(93), and S or H(.ii7) ; which, (in
common with almost any other three Intervals) are certainly
capable, of correctly expressing musical values, when negative
sigjis are used, yet this mode is perplexingly intricate, and in
deed, unnatural ; because, the progress of Modulation, and the
tuning of all Instruments, is conducted by means of the Concords^
the Fifths, Octaves, or major Thirds, the Notes of the com
mon Chord : and in no instance is it practicable to use T, t or
S, for the purpose of Tuning: why then should they be used in
deriving or explaining the general Scale, instead of III, V and
VIII ?, by which it is in fact produced, and whereby (when ne
gative signs are admitted) every Note may as readily be expressed,
as by means of S, t and T.
   I heartily wish that Mr. Flight of St. Martin's Lane, the Or
gan Builder, who is himself a good Musician, and a very in
genious Mechanic, were encouraged, by a Subscription among
                                                                        Musical

creasing an acute Mark, in proceeding one step diagonally downwards, m           ill
be found to range: and the number of artificial Commas will, each one,

 contrive an experimental Organ, having a single diapason Stop
 of 1224, or more, Pipes, tuned to two Octaves or more, of this
extended Scale ; so contrived, with different sets of Finger-keys
and Sliders, that for the purposes of Experiment, any two, three.
 Or four or more of the Notes, could be tried together, for deli
 berately ascertaining the effects on the Ear, of every possible
 Chord, however compound, and the shades of differences between
 such.

 the Octave, to which any of the 612 Notes could be attached at
 pleasure; by means of which, every species of Temperament of
 the common Scale, which has yet been proposed, or could be
 invented, might readily and intelligibly be put to the test of Ex
 periment; although not with absolute mathematical precision,
 yet with a nearer approach thereto, than has yet perhaps, ever
 in a single instance been attained, even by the celebrated Dr.
 Robert Smith, in tuning by the method of calculated Beats,
 which he invented.      Provided, that the Notes of Tempered Sy
 stems, intended to be tried, were calculated to the nearest arti
ficial Comma, in every instance (than which nothing can be more
  easy, by help of the Musical Corollaries which I gave in p. 374
 of your xxxvith volume) no greater error than about half a
  Schisma, or the T'Td part of a major Comma, or the -rj-^d part
 of an Isotonic Semitone, need in any instance be committed,

  safely lay out of his consideration, in judging of the real and
  comparative effects, of different systems of Temperament, with

  on the whole, best adapted to use on the Organ;  if such be not

44&       Mr. Farey's       proposed, new experimental     Organ.
    By   so  contriving the parts of the Instrument          intended for
Temperament        Experiments,        that the connection of  each of the
12 Finger-keys, could readily be shifted to different pipes, an
artificial Comma apartj in succession, these important questions
in Tuning, might at once be ascertained ; viz. 1st, whether the
Same Person, in repeated tuning, can always produce the same
identical Notes, throughout the 12?; aiid 2d, how far &ay two
practical Tuners, agree in their results, in this respect?.
    For insuring impartiality, and real experimental results in these
trials, the tops and mouths of the Pipes, and all such parts of
the Instrument might be kept closed and locked, which indi
cated, vjiat the particular Notes were, which practical Tuners
might thus select, by help of the blank sliders which they should
have to move, while Tuning: and then, each One who should
undertake to experiment in this way, might be allowed sufficient
 time, to deliberately and alone in a room, or only with such as
sistants as they might choose, in the best way satisfy themselves,
which they could, as to every Note.
    When this was done, a Committee of the Subscribers, or pro
per Persons appointed by them, should open the Instrument, and
fcfter writing down the 12 selected Notes, by means of the num
bers of artificial Commas, (which would serve on all occasions as
 designationsybr each of the individual Pipes and Notes) the ac
curacy of tune, of each of such selected Notes, should be tried, by
means of two, three or more of the Notes, above and below, which
stand in relation thereto, as 6ths, 3rds, Vlths and Illrds, in pre
ference to Vths or Octaves ; because, small errors, are, by these
less harmonious of the Concords, more strikingly shown and de
tected, than by means of the more harmonious of the Concords,
 Ists, VUIths or Vths.          Every result of such checks, on the tune
of the Instrument, being noted down and preserved.
    In this way, a great body of useful facts on the subject, might
be collected; and perhaps, premiums might be offered among
different practical Tuners, for such as could, in their Tuning,
come the nearest in these trials, to any given System throughout ;
the Mean-Tone, the Isotonic, or Dr. Smith's Equal Harmony,
for instance.      And other Premiums, for those who could most
exactly repeat their own particular mode of Tuning, in two or
three successive Trials, &c. &c.

      of Bavaria, &tc. &c. &c.*
 StR,       I  beg  leave to offer to the Society     of Arts the plan of
 mechanical invention, which I have executed with success in my
                                                                             a
 own country, but which, is not yet known in this, nor published
 any where.                          ..                            1
      It is a method of communicating rotatory motion to a consi
 derable distance from the person or persons who turn the ma
 chine, arid without the use of wheels or pinions, band-wheels, or
 any other of the usual means. I made use of it in an hydraulic
 machine to raise water from the foundations of houses, &c., the
 workmen standi ng on the bank or firm-ground, and giving mo
 tion to an axis with cranks placed over the water.
      I flatter myself that this invention will be found so much more
 worthy of your celebrated and patriotic Society, as its utility is
 perfectly ascertained by the experience of a number of years in
 Germany ; and, as its application may also prove beneficial to
 this country in many instances.

    In addition to the usual manner of placing men between the
 capstan bars, the ends of the bars should have notches or gaps
 made in them, in which an endless rope, A B, is received, and
 passes through two pulley blocks, C D; thus forming two straight
 lines, along which men being placed, can act by pulling the ropes
 in the most efficacious manner upon the capstan.

 Sir,     I  have heretofore had occasion to notice the mutations
  in the colour of the light of some of the larger fixed stars, and
  have communicated such observations through the medium of
  your Magazine.     I have now to commemorate the great, and, I
  may say, unusual brilliancy of this phsenomenon observed last
  night in the star Antares, which has afforded an opportunity,
, during the serenity of a long summer's night, of minutely observ
  ing and defining   it,together with the concomitant twinkling.
  About 9" 35' first noticed it. The star twinkled great deal
                I                                      a          ;
  and this motion called twinkling, seems to consist of successive
  dilatation and brightness, and of apparent contraction and dull
  ness, alternating with each other.      The alternating colours are
  deep red and bright white with a tinge of blue.        To be more
  explicit, have compared the red colour to the colour of cop
          I
  per filings ignited with gunpowder in the pyrotcchnical Jerbs,
  and the white colour to ignited steel filings.      The red colour
  happens in general just at, or a   little before, the maximum of

             of Antares, isfc. compared with other Stars.           453
the twinkle, or bright apparent dilatation of the star.        It seems
to occur only once in the course of five or six dilatations, though
now and then oftener: I could not distinctly ascertain any re
gular periods of it.      The intervening colour of the light hardly
varied, except in the brilliancy of the twinklings. Being at Tun-
bridge Wells, on very high ground, I watched the phenomenon
during great part of the night: sometimes the red colour was
very intense and bright, and was followed by an almost disap
pearance of the star by the apparent contraction.             I do not
know whether I use terms sufficiently explanatory; but it is dif
ficult, in describing phenomena not much treated of before, to
select the most appropriate terms.           I hope I shall convey to
the reader a tolerably clear idea of the fact, and that corresponding
observations will be made.         I noticed this appearance six or
seven years ago, in the month of September; but it has certainly
increased since that time. I may observe also that the twinkling
of Antares is greater than that of any other star visible at the
same time. As the above-mentioned alternation of colour is vi
sible in several other stars, I have noticed thein,with some of the
peculiarities attending the changes of their light.
1.   Antares in mean longitude 8* 7° 14' 24";              mean south
       latitude 4° 3(Y 4S".     Has the greatest twinkling, and most
       intense red colour alternating with white in the most irre*
       gular manner.
2. Betalgeus, or a Orionis, mean longitude 2" 26° 14' 26";
       south latitude 16° 3'         Alternations of red and yellowish,
       not so distinctly marked as the last, and the times of the
       red bear a greater proportion to those of the vellow.
3. Aldebaran, or ct Tauri, longitude 2' 7° 16' 26;' ; south lati
       tude 2' 29' 16".     Alternation still less conspicuous.
    As the above stars are iu very different places in the heavens,
and as the stars about them do not show the least alternation; so
I think the change of colour cannot depend on any thing in our
atmosphere, but must attend some alteration going on in the
alternating star.     I must observe also, that this phenomenon is
seen only in the red stars ; it is faintly observable in Arctwus,
 but wholly imperceptible in Lyra, or the bright star in the Eagle.
 In Syrius it is faintly observable, but perhaps the least so of all.
 Syrius is reported by the old astronomers to have been a red
star ; and perhaps the alternation I allude to, may be somehow
 connected with the more permanent change of colour of varying
stars.     The phenomenon is seen with refracting (and probably
 also reflecting) telescopes, and certainly deserves the attention
pf astronomers.        I  am, sir, &c.

    However doubtful or mysterious the art cf Agriculture may
 have formerly been considered, yet by the various improvements
which have been made in that art, and the great increase of
knowledge which has of late years been amassed, the difficulties

attending the practice of an improved System of Husbandry have,
 in a considerable degree, been removed, and its principles have
 become so much simplified, and so well understood, that the time
has at last arrived, when it is possible to undertake the arduous
task of drawing up        "A   Code of Agriculture."
     Till the present period had arrived, this could not have been
attempted with any well-founded hopes of success ; for so many
able and well-informed individuals had never, in any former era,
directed their attention to agricultural pursuits ;  so much ca
pital had never previously been employed in the cultivation of
the soil ;  so many practical farmers had never before published
the result of their experience, and observations on agricultural
subjects ; nor had those minute operations, on the due execution
of which the success of the farmer must in a great measure de
pend, been ever formerly so distinctly pointed out.  Hence the
superiority of the present era for such an undertaking.
     And if such a work were to be attempted at this time, there
is perhaps no individual on whom it was so incumbent to en
deavour to prove that it might be executed, as the person who
now ventures to offer the result of his labours to the public.            On
 this suggestion, the Government of Great Britain established a
 Board of Agriculture, and Internal Improvement ; under whose
 auspiees the greatest exertions were made to collect useful in
 formation, as a foundation for such a work as the one now pro-
 pesed, the publication of which, from the commencement of the
 new Institution, was in his contemplation.              A great body of
 valuable materials having been thus amassed*, what could be more
  desirable than to reduce the substance of the whole, into so mo
 derate a compass, that it would require neither much expense
  to purchase, nor much time to peruse ? How far it is practicable
  to carry such an idea into effect, the reader will soon have an
  opportunity of judging.
      But to enable any person to undertake such a task as the pre
  sent, it was not alone sufficient that he had access to books,
  however numerous^ or however valuable the information they
  might contain.      It was necessary for him to converse with farm
 ers, to discuss the various subjects connected with agriculture,
 with practical men ; to survey their farms ; to examine their va
  rious practices on the spot ; to compare the systems of different
     *  For that purpose, the agricultural circumstances of every district in
  the .kingdom were minutely examined, and Reports published, of the state
  of the several Counties of England, in 47 volumes octavo : and of Scotland,
  in 30 volumes more. Seven volumes of Communications, in quarto, and
  several other works on specific subjects, have also been published by the
  Board ; and this national undertaking was completed at an expense of
  nearly two hundred thousand    pounds.

best be executed, the following appeared to him the most simple,

     Remarks on Insanity, tending to illustrate the Physical Sym

    The third volume of the Zoological Miscellany will be pub
lished in September, illustrated with fifty-nine coloured plates.
    The long-expected work of Dr. Spurzheim on Insanity has at
length issued from the press. It contains some excellent and
perfectly new observations on this hitherto obscure disease.   But
perhaps the most important part of the work is that which re
lates to the confinement of person* suspected of insanity, on the
part of their relations, &c. by the mere declaration of an ig-
 ?ioi ant practitioner of medicine that the patient is mad.    The
 author also takes particular unties of the iieglected stale of
 madhouses, and of the hardships? suffered by the insane in lunatic
 asylums, and proposes many useful plans for their improvement.
 The principal doctrine maintained by the author        is,
                                                      that the dis
 eases of the mind are always diseases of the brain, which      the is
 organ of the manifestations of the mind in this its worldly state       ;
 and that they should be treated on the same pathological prin
 ciples as other disorders of material parts.   In the preliminary
observations, are some very useful remarks on the distinction
always to be made between the suppression, the fatigue, and the'
exhaustion of the vital power; and     a reference. made to a cu

     June 5.   A     paper  Dr. Leach, of the British Museum, was
                                  by
read, containing some observations on         new genus of marine

served    by
           Sir Joseph Banks, that the animal found in these shells                               is
not the fabricator of them, but     parasite which has taken up its
                                            a
occasional abode there    when     chooses to shield itself from the

direct action of the waves. This ingenious opinion has been pro
mulgated several years; but no direct confirmation, or groundsfor
rejecting       had hitherto fallen under the observation of na
               it,
turalists. The late expedition to the Congo river has enabled
Dr. L. to verify the truth of the learned President's observation,
and furnished him with an opportunity of examining minutely one
of these animals, and ascertaining to what genus        properly be             it
longs. He desoribed the means                       by
                                        which the animal attaches
itself to the empty argonaut shell, the manner        leaves and re        it

and, what removes all doubt respecting the origin of the shells^
he was so-fortunate as to discover some of the animal's eggs on
their margitt,which satisfied him that they could not be the makers
of their actual habitation. He then detailed the natural history of
snails, whose progressive changes he considered as exactly cor
responding to those of the animals in question ; he observed
that the eggs of snails, which are found in little white clusters,
each egg beinsi about the size of a common pin's head, and well
known to gardeners, are altogether about 2-1 days in changing
from the state of eggs till the perfectly-formed snail can creep
 from its nest. . His description of the eggs and the yolks both
of snails and the animal: in the nautilus, showed their great si
 milarity; and he concluded that it satisfactorily demonstrated the
justness of the President's previous observations on these shells.

   At a General Meeting of this Society held on the 10th June,
the following communications were read to the meeting, and
excited considerable interest :

    3. Account of a simple Method of ventilating Hot-beds with
Air moderately heated ; by Alexander Keith, esq., of Ravelstone.

     Mr. Jardine, one of the Vice-Presidents, announced, that he
  had received from .Dr. David Whyte, of Bombay, a packet con
  taining seeds of some curious and rare plants to be presented
  to the Society.    It. was agreed that the seeds should be trans

                     Sitting of 24th March 1817.
     M. Desfontames read a very ample Report upon a memoir of
  M. Desvaux, intituled Dispositio methodica Generum Lycopu-
 Jiomm et Filiaim.
     The work of M. Desvaux furnishes us with some new generai
 and one hundred and ten species of ferns not hitherto described.
  Their characters are exposed with exactness, and accompanied
 with designs.      The author adds some observations upon many
 other ferns already known, and critical notes on their synonyms.
     MM. Ampere and Cauchy made a Report upon a memoir of"
 M. de Maugold, "On the Manner of calculating Interest."
     It is known that when we take the interest of 5 per cent, at
 the end of a year as the product of a compound interest, the
 capitals increase not in arithmetical but in geometrical pro
 gression ; so that, for example, to obtain the sum of capita] at
 the end of six months, it is necessary, not to add to the original
 capital 2f per cent, but to multiply that capital by the square-
 root of l-f-l-20th, which gives a result somewhat less than by
 the other process, the geometric mean between two quantities
being always less than the arithmetic mean.           The tables which
 M. Maugold     has  constructed   are intended    to facilitate   the cal
culation of compound        interest for  any given    number      of days,
and in the opinion of the reporters they will be found of great
utility.
    March 31 . M. Burckardt made a Report upon the New Or
reries   of M. Jambon.
    The one which     has  been presented to the Academy is very
complete.     It represents the motions both of the old and the
new planets     the diurnal movement of the earth  the parallelism
of its axis of rotation and the nodes of the lunar orbit. The
reporters expressed themselves highly satisfied with it.

                          HYPERSTHENE ROCK.
D r. MacCulloch        has given this name to anew rock which he
has discovered in Scotland.     He has found it in two places : in
the island of Sky, and in Airdnamurehan. In the former it con
stitutes the great and picturesque mass of mountains known bv
the name of the Culin hills ; but is not limited to them, as Dr.
 M. has found that the hills which lie immediately to the east ci
these, and which encircle the romantic valley .of Coruisk, an
formed of the same rock : he even suspects that a portion of Bla-
ven also is composed of it.    Dr. M. ascertained the existence of
this rock five years ago, pointing out to travellers at the sam?
time the picturesque and sublime scenery of the spot where it is
found, at that time unknown out of the island, and scarcely in
deed known to any within       except the proprietor Mr. Macalistcr
                                it,

quainted with the popular poem, " The Lord of the Hes,"                  in
-whichit    described the curiosity of the poet having, fortunately
            is        ;

 Rut the descriptive powers even of Walter Scott fail to convey an
 idea of that which exceeds as far the powers of poetiy as      docs

the traveller repent his labours,        ifthe only reward of his High
land tour should be   a      day spent among the wild mountains that
surround this romantic spot. We shall render both the traveller
and the mineralogist an acceptable service, by informing them           of
a route not described      by  the Scottish tour-books, and by facili

the west side of Sleat, whence boats can be procured, in which
the voyage to Loch Scairg may be completed in a day; or the
traveller may set up his quarters at Broadford, and thence make
his excursion wjth perhaps greater facility. It           not accessible

    The mountains composed of this rock are remarkable for their
rugged outlines and dark colour         ;from which causes they are    di
stinguishable     far at sea, being strongly contrasted with the neigh
bouring hilly. They present the general features of granite, the
rocks being disposed in large continuous, masseswith curved sur
faces, and sometimes appearing to form large concretions of at
      '~-
                                                                    oblats

                           Hypersthene    Rock.                   4G5
oblate spheroidal shape. This rock is singularly durable ; seem
ing to. undergo no waste capable of generating a soil, either upon
the surface or at the Jeet of the mountains.         Hence they pre
sent an aspect of entire desolation, their whole visible declivity,
where they surround the lake, being brown and bare, with scarcely
a mark of vegetable life.
    The geological relations of this rock are ascertained, not only
by its intimate connexion with the greenstone, basalt, amygda
loid, and sienite, that form the greatest part of the island, but by
its actual overlying position on beds of red sandstone, which are
fully described in Dr. M.'s papers before the Geological Society,
from which we have extracted these circumstances.             Hyper
sthene rock is therefore a member of the trap family ; and We
think there is reason to conclude that it is also of later origin
than the lias formation  a reason derived from the author's ac
count of the other parts of the island.
    There are many varieties of structure and appearance ; but the
varieties of composition seem reducible to three : hypersthene
with greenish compact felspar, with dark purple ditto, and with
crystallized felspar approaching to glassy. The concretions vary
much in size : when large, the nature of the rock is easily ascer
tained ; when minute, it is easily mistaken for greenstone ; since
the hypersthene may be confounded with hornblende, a mistake
which the author suspects to have been often made. The purple
felspar resembles that of Labrador, but is never iridescent. Con
temporaneous veins traverse the rocks in many places, containing
very large concretions, and affording fine specimens of the several
mineral substances. It must also be added, that veins of oxidulous
 iron ore are found in it ; and that crystals of this substance of
 a tetrahedral form constitute in many cases an integrant part of
 the rock.
     It is probable that a similar rock is the birth-place of the hy
persthene and purple felspar of Labrador,and that it will be found
 hereafter in many places where it has either been overlooked,
 or confounded with common greenstone. It has generally hap
 pened in the history of mineralogical discovery, that a substance
 has been found common when once it had been shown to exist.
 We may instance the quartz rock of the same author, long over
 looked as an occasional substance of trifling extent, or confounded
 with mica slate, and now proved to form a leading division of the
primitive rocks all over the globe, since it occurs in the moun
 tainous regions of India and southern Africa, occupying tracts of
 great extent.
    A proof of this is given in the author's discovery of the same
 Hypersthene rock in Airdnamurchan, a spot frequently examined
 bv' geologists.    Here, as in Sky, it forms an extensive tract, hi-
     Vol. 49. No. 2W. June 1817.             (ig                thcrto

therto mistaken for greenstone.    This place is of easy access,
both by sea from Mull, and from the interior by means of the
 Moidart and Airdnamurchan new roads.
   We may terminate these remarks by suggesting to mineralo
gists the necessity of examining more minutely into the supposed
greenstones of the trap family.   There is reason to expect that
among these Augit Rock, also described in the same memoir,
at Sky, will be found to occupy the place too often assigned to
greenstone.    Mineralogists have for some time remarked, that
augit  was found  in trap rocks ; but the author above mentioned
has found it so prevalent, where formerly overlooked, or con
founded with the greenstones containing hornblende, that he
has been induced to designate this member of the trap family
also by an appropriate term.       It forms a large tract on the
north-east coast of Sky ; and it seems moreover to constitute
nearly the whole trap formation of Ruin ; besides which, we un
derstand that he has traced it in many other parts of Scotland.
It is composed of augit and felspar, both of these minerals being
subject to considerable variations, and the compounds therefore
presenting a great variety of aspects.     When the augit is green
and the felspar glassy, as in some parts of Rum, the rock is easily
recognised ; wheu the former is black, and the latter of the com
pact kind, it is more difficult to distinguish it from ordinary
greenstone. When extremely fine, it forms a rock not to be di
stinguished from basalt by mere inspection.       We expect a fuller
account of this important rock from the author, and of the way
in which it can, under all its aspects, be distinguished from com
mon greenstone. The utility of the name will be apparent to all
who know the power that names possess in natural history of
directing attention to the objects of its pursuit; and there may
also be pointed out an important and new analogy thus proved to
exist between the traps and the lavas of modern volcanoes, of
which augit, and not hornblende, has also been recently shown to
be a principal constituent.

  Notwithstanding the numerous accidents arising from burning
charcoal in close rooms, a correspondent assures us, that he, as
well as several of his friends, to whom he has recommended         it,
 has experienced almost immediate relief from cough and catarrhal
affections by  sitting a few hours in his library with   a   chaffing-
dish of burning charcoal near his feet.       He has found this prac
tice so effectual   a check to the effects of cold during the winter
season, that he can assuage even      a    violent catarrhal cough in
the course of   a  single day. It   has even relieved persons with
weak lungs, and who are consequently subject to coughs during
the continuance of cold weather or easterly winds.

                              To Mr. Tilloch.
      Sir,  In   that part of my paper describing the construction
  of an ceconomical culinary stove, from which the extract relative
  thereto was made, which appeared in your last Number j I ob
 serve that I did not make myself sufficiently intelligible with
  respect to the direction of the flue which surrounds the oven,
 After it has passed under the bottom, it rises and expands over
 the side furthest from the fire-place, and thence passes vertically
 round the back to the other side without ascending or descending.
 For the channel, being two inches and a half or not more than
 three inches wide, necessarily occupies nearly or quite the whole
 height of an oven of twelve inches in passing round the angles
 at its back, as the section of the flue should not be much less
 than thirty square inches in any part of its course to ensure what
 is called a good draught.
     I fear I was likewise somewhat obscure in describing the si
 tuations of the moveable stoppers, but these an intelligent work
 man will readily adapt to the flues.      One may be placed in the
 side furthest from the fire-place at the bottom of the back angle
 where the flue ascends from under the oven over its side, an^
passes round its back, for the convenience of cleaning these dif
ferent parts ; another may 6pen into the flue on the side of the
 oven next the fire-place, at the bottom of the angle where it
 passes from the back round that side ; the third over the oven-
 door.
    In submitting these remarks, I beg pardon for intruding so
 much on your attention.
              I am, sir, your obedient servant,
