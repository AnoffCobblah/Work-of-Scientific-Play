    “An Eramination of those Phaenomena of Geology, which
    seem to bear most directly on theoretical Speculations.”   By
    C. LYELL, Esq. F.R.S. For. Sec. G.S. &c.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
                                -
       Gentlemen,
 I OBSERVE         in the first page of your last Number (De
     cember 1830) the following passage, in a paper by my
friend the Rev. W. D. Conybeare: “While on classical sub
jects, I would just remark how much I am gratified by finding
 every quotation in Mr. Lyell’s able remarks on the attention
 of the ancients to geology, identical with those previously
given in my own Outlines, with the single exception of the
 passage from Strabo, to which,    however, I have given a re
 ference although certainly partial and imperfect: as there is
 not a word of acknowledgement, of course this coincidence is
accidental.”—Surprised at this unexpected charge,        I  imme
 diately compared the second chapter of my “Principles of
 Geology” with those two pages of the introduction to the
 “Outlines,” (pp. 38, 89,) which comprise the whole of Mr.
 Conybeare's allusions to the geological doctrines to be met
 with in the writings of classical antiquity. The authors cited
 in those pages are Aristotle, Lucretius, Seneca, Plutarch,
 Pliny, Herodotus, Polybius, Strabo, Pausanias, Xenophon,
 Theophrastus, and Ovid. Of these twelve, five only are to
 be found among the classical authorities adverted to by me;
viz. Aristotle, Seneca, Pliny, Strabo, and Ovid. The passages

2               Mr. Lyell's Reply                   to the    Rev. Mr. Conybeare
which   I have cited from Aristotle and Seneca relating to the
supposed periodical revolutions of the globe, had been pre
viously collected and commented upon in Dr. Prichard's
“Egyptian Mythology,” a work to which I have been careful
to refer in no less than four places in my second chapter, and
to which Mr. Conybeare has also acknowledged his obliga
tions in his Introduction (p. 39).    In regard to other citations
from Aristotle's   Meteorics,  besides that they must be familiar
to        all
       who are      once scholars and naturalists, Mr. Conybeare
                                at
can  hardly      ignorant  that they have been referred
                           be                                   again                           to

II.  Memoir of the late J. S. Miller, A.L.S. Curator of the Museum
of the Bristol Philosophical Institution. By A Correspondent.
MR.       J. S. MILLER was a native of Dantzig, the only son
       of truly respectable parents. He was designed by his
father for commercial pursuits, and served an apprenticeship
with M. Dennies, a merchant of his native town.           He came
to England in 1801, with a full resolution of proceeding to
America, and with letters of recommendation to persons in
that country.      The vessel in which he expected to cross the
Atlantic had sailed on the day before his arrival; and being
thus detained in Bristol, he formed connections by which he
was finally induced to alter his purpose and to fix his abode
in this city. Here he endeavoured to establish himself in
mercantile business, but his efforts were unsuccessful; and it
happened, unfortunately for his prospects in life, that Dantzig
 was at this period overrun and pillaged by the French. His
 father's property shared the common fate; and of fifteen hun
 dred pounds which had been left to Mr. Miller, nothing ever
 came into his possession except a box of valuable coins, which
 was concealed during two years in a church, and a very                  in
 considerable sum of money.          He now devoted himself en
 tirely to scientific pursuits, for which he had shown a strong
inclination from his early youth, and he soon acquired very ex
 tensive information in various branches of natural history.
 Some curious researches in entomology introduced him at an
 early period to the acquaintance of Dr. Leach, and this was
 the first occasion on which his talents became known beyond
 the circle of his personal friends.   The prospect of succeeding
 Dr. Leach at the British Museum opened a new field to his
 mind; and although he was frustrated in this expectation by
 the appointment of Mr. Children, he applied himself from this
 time with increased energy to his researches in natural history.
 An investigation of the structure and nature of the organic
 remains of the Encrinus, for which the vicinity of Bristol af.
 fords so remarkable a field, now became his favourite pursuit.
 It was while he was engaged in the publication of his well
 known work on the Crinoidea, that he became known to the
 Rev. W. D. Conybeare, by whom his merit was soon distin
 guished and very highly appreciated.       As the work was going
 through the press, Mr. Conybeare kindly undertook to revise
it,  and,    by
              correcting the peculiarities      foreign idiom",

render it more acceptable to the public than it might otherwise
have been.      In this publication Mr. Miller had to surmount
many difficulties; and although it became the means of spread
ing universally his reputation as a profound and accurate na
turalist, it was to him a source not only of present expense, but
of ultimate pecuniary loss. This may be attributed in part to
                                                 º
his great liberality of disposition.       I am informed that he
gave away not less than a hundred copies of his work, princi

ness          of mind which readily seized on general relations, he
joined the most indefatigable patience of laborious investiga
 tion,-a quality particularly requisite in the branch to which
he especially directed his attention; viz. the elucidation of the
history of the organic remains which are preserved in our
strata in a fossilized state. In this state individual specimens
generally occur in a more or less imperfect condition, so that
the real type of the organization can seldom be ascertained
without the most careful comparison of many particular                                                    re
lics. They are likewise in many instances so imbedded in
the solid rock, that the most essential parts are concealed, and
cannot be detected without the nicest dexterity of manual
operation.     When these circumstances are taken into the
account, we may fairly appreciate the labour and talent ne
cessary to produce such a work as Mr. Miller's account of
the fossil Crinoidea.     This family of organic bodies, from the
delicate beauty and interesting character of many of                spe                             its

established       the most  incomplete    manner,    and have placed
in  every respect       the fullest and clearest light, the whole

  8       Rev.  J. Challis on the theoretical Determination
 nication   to the Phil. Mag, and Annals of Philosophy for
 August 1829, which contained several inaccuracies, I made
 an assertion respecting this case of fluid motion, the correct
 ness  of which subsequent consideration has only tended to con
 firm; viz. that when uda +vdy--w dz is an exact differential,
 the whole motion is such that the motion of each elementary
 portion of the fluid is directed to a fixed or moveable centre.
 The course of the reasoning by which this proposition may
 be established is I conceive such as follows. We know from
 the theory of partial differential equations, that their integrals,
 whether we can obtain them exactly or not, must contain arbi
 trary functions.    The arbitrariness of which we are informed
 by pure analysis, has a signification in the applications of the
 functions to physical questions. Thus the existence of arbitrary
 functions in the integrals of the equations which determine the
 motion of fluids, is the proper proof that we can give to the
 fluid any motion we please; and this is an evident consequence
 of one of the fundamental principles in the investigation of
 the motion,-the perfect mobility of the particles. The forms
 of the functions depend on the particular motion we choose to
 give to the fluid by vessels, pipes, or other means. But how
 ever irregular we may cause the motion to be, it may still be
 conceived to be composed of elementary motions, which obey
 the law of continuity, independently of our will, just as a line,
 however broken and irregular, may be conceived to be made
up of elementary portions which are straight lines. Absolute
 discontinuity is inconceivable.    The law of these motions will
be independent of time and position, and dependent only on
the nature of the fluid.       Hence, to learn whether the motion
be really so composed, it will be necessary, after having ob
tained the complete integral of the equation expressing the
continuity of the fluid, to ascertain whether the arbitrary func
tions which the integral contains, can be shown to have a
particular form, when discussed on the supposition that the
origins of the time and coordinates are not fixed. This will
in general require the solution of a functional equation. An
instance of this reasoning was given in the communication
above mentioned, for the case in which the motion is in space

form of the arbitrary functions, when treated according to the

When          a   mass of incompressible fluid revolves uniformly, with
out changing form, about a fixed axis, dº is not an exact dif
ferential; and it is plain that the motions of elementary por
tions of the fluid are not directed to fixed or moveable cen
tres, because the whole mass moves in such a manner that it
may be considered solid.     Again, Euler has shown that dº is
not an exact  differential, when a mass of incompressible fluid
revolves round a fixed axis, and the velocity is any function
of the distance from the axis, and yet that the general equa
tions are satisfied by this case of motion.        may in this                    W.

taining numerous basaltic boulders, water-worn, as usual.
This soil is red; but colour does not always indicate the na
ture of the rocks below, for a red soil also covers the por
phyries and sienites of the north of England and the south of
Scotland.     By a cut on the side of the road immediately be
yond Coldstream Bridge, the incumbent mass of loose earth
is shown to be not less than fifty feet thick, at that spot, from
 the top of the bank to the road, and for fifty feet more, to the
brink of the stream, no rock is seen to crop out from under
the debris; and subsequent remarks led me to think that this
part of the country was generally clothed by a diluvial soil of
considerable thickness.         To avoid repetition, it may not be
amiss to enumerate the rocks which are the subject of these
notes.     Excluding basalt, they are                        all

 when again seen, were found associated with red sandstone, in
 the vicinity of Norham.
     The town of Coldstream stands on what are usually called
 coal-measures, comprising sandstones and bituminous shales,
 exactly the same as those of the Newcastle coal-field, and
wherever diluvium does not form the shores of the river, these
 may be traced for the distance of two miles and a half.           The
 little river Leat, which here empties itself into the Tweed,
 passes through Mill Haugh, where the late Lord Home bored
 for coal, but to what depth               I
                                   could not ascertain.     An exten
 sive free-stone quarry is worked in this field to the depth of
 thirty feet; the upper and middle beds are white micaceous
 sandstone, fine-grained, and full of coal pipes, the lower is
 free from these vegetable exuviae”.           A strong chalybeate
 spring rises to the day, and runs into the Leat at a short                                     di
stance from the quarry.        Both above and below Coldstream
 Bridge the Tweed flows over these coal measures, which dip,
at a trifling angle, to the south-east, and the rocks on the south
 side having been cut through, micaceous sandstone, alterna
ting with bituminous shale, and covered with a bank of red
earth, are laid open to view, and beds of the same nature may
be noticed half a mile lower down the stream.             But the cliff
at Lennel    Braes,  on the north   side,  two miles to the eastward,
exhibits the most perfect section of this suite of strata to be
met with in the vicinity. At the Braes the perpendicular cliff
extends for more than a hundred yards, and was estimated by
me at forty feet in height, exclusive of                       its

     Mr. Winch      on the Geology      of the Banks of the Tweed.        15
feet,  and is situated more than twenty feet above the river.
The stone here has a slight tinge of red, similar to the stra
tum in the upper part of the cliff at Firebourn, which abuts
against the calcareous beds.           It dips to the southward, and is
divided    by  thin slaty   micaceous partings, and capped by about
ten feet of loose sand, the abode of flights of sand-martins.
On the north side of the Tweed, at the distance of a mile
above Twizell Ferry, rocks of well-defined red sandstone make
their appearance.         It is fine-grained in texture, of a dark red
dish-brown colour, and abounds with spangles of silvery mica.
The cliff is of considerable elevation, and from hence to the
sea coast, thick beds of red and variegated sandstone, at some
places covered by the thin calcareous strata previously men
tioned, and at others interstratified with them, become preva
lent, though coal measures may be noticed in their vicinity.
On descending the river until opposite Twizell Boat-House,
fine-grained micaceous red sandstone rocks, and those of the
coal formation, or at least such as have heretofore been con
sidered exclusively as such, are in close contact.                   On the
north shore, low rocks of the latter description appear in situ,
and it may be worth remarking, that, on ascending the river
Till, for the distance of a mile westward, Twizell Castle may
be seen, built on an extremely hard gray micaceous sandstone,
filled with coal scars”, and so promising did this neighbour
hood appear, as to induce the proprietor to make a trial for
coal.     Three-quarters of a mile further up the Till, the red
rocks are again met with, and worked at Mill Quarry, but at
Dunston Haugh, two miles and a half from the Castle, the
stratum quarried is yellowish-white, and seemed to be a coal
sandstone. But to return to Tweed side. On the south bank,
above the Ferry House there is a perpendicular cliff, forty
feet high, of white sandstones, though tinged red on their sur
faces by the oxidation of their mica; the beds are separated by
 thin micaceous partings, and in every respect resemble the rock
 quarried below Lennel. On the north side, just below the ferry,
 the cliff is not less than 50 feet above the stream, and composed
 of fine-grained red sandstone, with small scales of silvery mica.
 On descending the river, the rocks on the south shore con
 tinue red, micaceous partings divide the thick strata, through
 which nodules of red ochre are dispersed in abundance, and
 those on the north side agree with them in every character.
    * Minute fragments of red garnets are embedded in this sandstone; a
 circumstance I have never noticed in the sandstones of the Newcastle coal
 field; but in the millstone grit at Shaftoe Crags, near Wallington, the same
 mineral was detected by W. C. Trevelyan, Esq., and it abounds in the
 grauwacke of Bournmouth, north of Berwick. The Twizell sandstone I
 suspect to be an old member of the carboniferous limestone formation.

      Opposite Newbiggin, the elevated cliffs are rendered sin
   gular by an escarpment of bright red marl, which, from a
   distance, is a striking object.    The dip is towards the south
  east. Near Norham Boat-House, the Tweed sweeps round
  the foot of a promontory of not less than seventy to eighty feet
  in height;           its
                  rocks are red, and differ       respect from those

ninety feet high.   Under the soil the rocks are variegated and

the place of our metals and bituminous shales; but so consi

fossil which gives the name of cockle-shell limestone to one
of the beds in the neighbourhood of Alston. On the beach
the limestone is laid bare by the action of the waves, and ex
hibits the extraordinary undulations long since noticed in the
stratification at Holy Island.           Probably the stratum may be
the same; but it is not safe to hazard conjectures on the iden
tity of mineral beds on a coast where their dips are so various,
and positions unconformable.
   On the south side of the harbour, at the distance of half a
mile from the bridge, the strata incline to the south-east at an
angle of 45°, and are arranged in the following order:-1st,
fine-grained pale red sandstone; 2nd, a thin stratum of slaty
micaceous sandstone; 3rd, twenty-five feet of dark red mica
ceous sandstone; 4th, shale, with thin strata of encrinal lime
stone; 5th, red sandstone, divided by the same limstone:—
the total thickness of these beds is one hundred and twenty
feet.     Below Spital Mill, half a mile further south, a thick
stratum of sandstone, of peculiar appearance, crops out; it is
yellow, blotched with red, and is very friable,              grains scarcely its

 well as in England, horizontal: throughout Germany and
 France such is their general situation, excepting in the vici
 nity of the great, though local disturbances which have ele
 wated the Alpine and Pyrenean chains.
     Partial disturbances are however yet observable.          In the
 lias of  Bristol, instances of faults of about 200 feet sometimes
 extending for more than a mile, and attended with contorted
 strata, &c. have been noticed in my paper on the South-west coal
 fields, in the Geological Transactions. The view of East cliff in
 the same memoir presents some smaller faults;—in my present
 neighbourhood, on the Glamorganshire coast, the lias which
 reposing on new red sandstone crowns the summit of Pen
 narth Point, is towards the centre of that headland depressed
 about 100 feet to the sea level by a complicated fault. On the
 north of Barry Island is a fault which must be nearly 200
 feet, throwing down the lias, and producing at the fracture
 curved and vertical strata. This fault strikes the contiguous
 shores of the mainland, and extends over an interval of a mile.
 Many other faults occur in the lias of this coast, which yet
 strikingly exhibits the decreasing energy of the convulsive
 forces in this as compared with the preceding period; for the
 carboniferous limestone is often exhibited towards the base of
 the cliffs, (its strata elevated 70 degrees,) on which the red
 marl and lias repose horizontally;—disturbances in the lias of
 the Yorkshire coast are mentioned in the surveys of Young
 and Phillips: and the analogous formations of Scotland, in
 the Brora coal-field, &c. are much deranged : indeed, from
 their relation to the adjacent primitive mountains it appears
 probable that the elevation of the latter was in part, at least,
 effected during this period.
    The oolitic formations have been less examined in this re
 spect.    I may however mention, that in the neighbourhood of
        I
 Bath have found in the hills above Bitton, the inferior oolite
to participate in a fault affecting the lias, and throwing the
beds down about 200 feet.        In the cliffs west of Bridport har
bour on the Dorsetshire coast, a considerable fault accom
panied with vertical strata may be observed. The distur
bances affecting the oolites of the Weymouth district and Isle
of Purbeck, must however be referred to the great convulsion
which has affected the whole of that part of our coast and the
Isle of Wight, subsequently to the deposition of the chalk
formation, and during the tertiary period. The analogous
formations of the Jura chain are much disturbed, the whole
chain exhibiting in places an arched section; but these con
vulsions must be referred to the forces which have elevated
the Alps, and which certainly continued their action until
                                                                  the

the middle of the tertiary period. The observations as yet
made on that great chain are scarcely sufficiently full or ac
curate to determine whether that elevation was at once effected
by a single period of convulsion, or gradually during many
such successive periods”; but the latter opinion appears far
more probable, and seems most agreeable with what is hitherto
known. It is scarcely necessary to add, after our introductory
observations on this article, that the method of determining
this point would be, carefully to examine the junction of the
different constituent formations, and carefully to examine how
far they were conformably affected by the same convulsions.
On this point the sections published by Ebel are scarcely
sufficiently minute or accurate to afford the requisite informa
tion. In those of Mr. Murchison we find the tertiary conglo
merates, &c. of Gossau overlying unconformably: but as on
the Italian side the vertical beds of scaglia (equivalent to
chalk) and of the succeeding tertiary deposits seem quite con
formable to the older formations, we have here convulsions
even as late as the tertiary period, compared with which, every
thing of actual occurrence, the elevation of Jorullo, &c. dwin
dles into insignificance.
    In our own island the elevation of the central range of
chalk in the Isle of Wight, and that of the Isle of Purbeck,
must be referred to the same period. If by examining the re
lations of the contiguous formations it appears to have been the
result of a single convulsion, limited to a period subsequent
 to the lower tertiary deposits and antecedent to the higher,
 this single convulsion, thus limited to a point of time geologi
 cally, affects a district nearly sixty miles in length (from the
 east   of the Isle of Wight to Whitenore Point, east of Wey
 mouth): and if we take into account the thickness of the strata
 moved, and the extent of their dislocation, it must have occa
 sioned an angular movement throughout the whole of this
 space averaging more than 1000 feet.              I  could only desire
 the advocates of “actual         causes,”  energizing  with their pre
 sent degree of power, to show me a single instance of any
 effect produced by them in the least comparable with this.
     VI. The analogous rocks belonging to the different succes
 sive formations present a regular gradation in texture and
 consolidation: the earliest being the most crystalline and
 compact; and these characters becoming regularly less and

characterize the earlier rocks may be produced by igneous

    Observations.—All rocks may be conveniently classed under
the comprehensive genera Calcareous, Quartzose, and Argilla
ceous. We may examine what have been called the formation
suites of each of these in order.—I. The Calcareous class pre
sents, 1st, in the earliest deposits saccharine marble; 2ndly,
compact and semi-crystalline rocks in the transition and car
boniferous series; 3rdly, rocks of less compact and looser
texture in the oolites; 4thly, earthy rocks in the chalk and
tertiary formations.—II. The Quartzose series exhibits, 1st,
crystalline quartz rock; 2ndly, compact sandstones in the
carboniferous formation; 3rdly, looser sandstone; 4thly, sand.
—III. The Argillaceous series is represented, 1st, by com
pact clay slate in the lowest deposits; 2ndly, by semi-indu
 rated shales in the carboniferous group; and 3rdly, by com
mon clay in the subsequent formations.
     Now these changes are analogous to those which are
known, or generally believed to be the result of igneous ac
 tion. In Sir J. Hall's experiments on the fusion of lime under
 the pressure of a column of water, crystalline marble was pro
 duced ; and besides these actual experiments we may refer to
 the changes effected by trap dykes, as universally acknow
 ledged to be of igneous origin. In the north of Ireland the
 chalk where covered by trap becomes a compact limestone,
 and where intersected by trap dykes, assumes completely the
 texture of primitive saccharine marble for some yards from
 the contact.     The lias shales become here and in Scotland
 altered by the contact with trap into flinty slates, and loose
 sandstones into compact and crystalline.         In Professor Hens
 low’s very valuable account of Anglesea, in the Cambridge
  Philosophical Transactions, much information on this subject
  will be found. In one place he describes a mass of granitic
  texture which appears to have resulted from sandstone thus
 altered. In Cornwall and the Lead Hills of Scotland, wherever
 the granite protrudes through the incumbent grauwacké, we
  find an intervening zone approximating in          itscharacters      to
  gneiss, which certainly appears    to   be

  contact: and Boué believes this     to   be
                                            the case generally with

  scribed in Professor Sedgwick's paper in your Number for
  August last; but if the elevation of these mountains be referred
 to a volcanic force which must have violently affected these
 regions to a later period than the general surface of our con
 tinents,  it is exactly what we should expect, that the consti
  tuent rocks should there also exhibit to a later period the
  effects of intense igneous action.
     On the whole, then, as in our preceding article we saw rea
  son to conclude, from the dislocations of the strata, that the
  forces (probably of a volcanic nature) which at first affected
  them with intense violence, subsequently from time to time
  experienced a gradual diminution of energy,        so we here
  find the texture of the constituent rocks indicating a like      di
  minution of igneous action at the successive periods marked
  by the deposition of the series of formations.
     VII. The series of organic remains both vegetable and
| animal included in the successive formations indicate also, a
  diminution of temperature from the earlier to the later pe
 riods.
   Observations.—Adolphe      de Brongniart's admirable treatise
 on vegetable fossils, fully proves this as to that kingdom.  In
 a late communication to the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,
  I have endeavoured myself shortly to state the argument as it
 affects the animal kingdom.   Mr. Lyell has given a very          in
 genious explanation of the change of temperature as arising
 from the gradual growth of the continents and elevation of
 the mountain chains.      I only doubt whether the cause thus
 suggested, is fully adequate to account for the degree of the
 resulting effects: besides which, the general analogy of the
 phaenomena noticed in the preceding articles,       all
                                                       converging
 on one  point, seems rather      to
                                indicate the gradual refrigeration
 of  the surface      of   an
                         originally heated mass, (such        as
                                                               the
 theories  ofLeibnitz and all his imitators suppose,) and this re
 frigeration must necessarily have accompanied the gradual
 formation of solid crust.

merate the whole of them would far exceed the limits which
we can conveniently devote to the subject; and we must
therefore refer the reader to the Report itself. They are of
a nature, as the Council very justly observe, to satisfy not only
the wishes of the astronomer, but also the demands of the na
vigator; and (what is also very gratifying to hear) are not
likely, with a due regard to oeconomy, to add much to the ex
pense of the publication.
   Upon the whole we cannot help congratulating the public
upon this vast accession of strength to the most useful branches
of astronomy and navigation: and we consider that they are
much indebted to the Council of the Astronomical Society,
for the great labour and time which they have devoted to this
important subject.     It appears that an interval of two or three
years must necessarily elapse before these improvements can
be completely carried into effect.     The Nautical Almanac for
1833 is already computed, and nearly ready for publication;
so that the proposed alterations cannot take place till the year
 1834: and the Council have particularly requested that they
be not deferred beyond that period.
   With a view of insuring a greater degree of accuracy in the
computations, and as a means of detecting any errors, the
Council have recommended that, in the Preface to each year's
almanac, there be inserted an account of all the tables and
authorities depended upon in every computation, with an ex
press notice of such equations as may be omitted, or of any cor
rections introduced.     And they have also recommended that
notice of  any  errors should be advertised in the London Ga
zette, and in some of the public papers, as soon as possible
after their discovery.
     If
      these suggestions are strictly attended
                                                  to,and the whole
some advice given    by   the Council   be duly followed, we have
no doubt that the important and valuable contents       of  the New
Nautical Almanac will insure    it  a place  inalmost every vessel
that sails on the ocean, and   in every active observatory   in  the
world.

VII.   On the Visitation           of Greenwich Observatory; with a Copy
                               of the New Warrant.
THE   annual visitation of the Royal

Council of the Royal Society and to such other persons as
they might from time to time invite for that purpose, by virtue
of the King's warrant directed to them at the commencement
ofevery reign. His present Majesty, however, has been pleased
to make a totally new arrangement on this subject.         But,
before we enter on the cause of this alteration, we would re
mark that when this annual visitation was first established,
Flamsteed was greatly offended; inasmuch as he considered
that the Council of the Royal Society (with whom he was not
on the best terms) was thus set over him as a sort of spy upon
his actions. It has however been silently acquiesced in by his
successors; but, whatever importance it might at a more early
period have possessed, it has gradually declined from       ori                               its
ginal object, and ceased     answer the   purpose
                                            to     for which                                        it
was designed; for little                 or         no

ing: and        any matter requiring consideration was brought
               if
forward,    itwas always turned over        the Council      the Royal
                                                              to                    of

         Eramination of a Native Sulphuret of Bismuth.         31
bismuth was prepared, and the three following experiments
tried with it:—one quantity was precipitated by potassa in great
excess, another by ammonia, and these were digested at a
boiling heat for about six hours; the third portion was added
gradually to a large quantity of very hot solution of potassa;
and the whole three collected and well washed, dissolved in
nitric acid and tested as before; muriatic acid was however
detected in each.    It was evident from these results, that mu
riatic acid could not be employed in the analysis, or that, if
employed,     it must be separated before the precipitation of
the oxide of bismuth.     6-88 grs. of the mineral were digested
in nitric acid as long as any sulphur remained undissolved; it
was then filtered, and gave 345 gr. silica.        The sulphuric
acid was next separated by a solution of nitrate of baryta added
as long as any precipitate was occasioned, and the sulphate of
baryta, after heating to redness, weighed 9-654 grs. After the
excess of baryta had been carefully removed, ammonia added
in excess threw down the oxides of bismuth and iron as be
fore, and held the oxide of copper, which was obtained in the
manner before stated, and equalled '306 of a grain. The weight
of the mixed oxides was 5'594 grs., which were then dissolved
in muriatic acid, and a current of sulphuretted hydrogen passed
 through the solution, and the whole thrown upon a filter: the
 clear solution which passed through was boiled for some time,
 and after the addition of a little nitric acid to bring the iron
 to the state of peroxide, ammonia was added, and the oxide
 collected weighed 344 gr.; deducting this from the weight of
 the mixed oxides, leaves 5:25 grs. as the quantity of oxide of
 bismuth; the results are, therefore,
          Oxide of bismuth......  5-25     4-718 bismuth.
          Sulphate of baryta.... 9.654     1:309 sulphur.

  Or, we may consider the mineral to be constituted of 57815
 grs. sulphuret of bismuth, being in the proportion of 1 atom
  bismuth + 1 atom sulphur, and that the iron, copper, and
 silica are merely parts of the matrix which cannot be sepa
 rated mechanically from the pure mineral.

IX.   Recent Discovery of the Ladder of M. de Saussure in the
     Merde Glace, with Inferences respecting the Progressive
  Movement of Glaciers.
[We have been favoured with the following paragraph from the Journal de
     Genève, to which are added a few observations                        by an English gentleman

           ladder which M. de Saussure used in crossing the
       crevices in the ice during his first visit to the Col du
Géant, and which he left on the upper part of the glacier,
has lately been discovered imbedded in the Mer de Glace, in
a situation nearly opposite to the aiguille called Le Moine.
This ladder, moving on with the body of the ice, will thus
appear to have advanced three leagues since the year 1787.”
   M. Plouquet, a German writer, published some years since
a pamphlet in which he endeavoured to prove that the pro
gressive movement of the glaciers was a thing physically im
possible.          If
               M. Plouquet, or the editor of the Literary Ga
zette of Jena, in which paper appeared a confirmation of his
statement, could visit the spot where the immortal De Saus
sure's ladder now                 is,
                       and still persist     the opinion that the

 34   Mr. Bakewell's Facts and Observations relating to                                         the
 deserve attention, in reference to certain opinions that have
 been recently advanced in geology; and it may serve to prove
 how extremely cautious we should be in drawing general                                               in
 ductions from isolated facts. During a visit to Nottingham
 in the last summer, a medical gentleman in that town brought
 me part of a bone which was pronounced by an eminent phy
 siologist to be a portion of the femoral bone of a horse or an
 ox. This bone was found in forming an excavation in the
 sand-rock on which Nottingham and              Castle stand;       its
                                                                  was                           it
 about  forty  feet below the surface; and the workmen who found
it asserted most confidently, that the rock          which    was im       in              it
bedded was solid, and that there was          fissure              no

 the place. The sand-rock           Nottingham contains numerous

other situations where the bare rock was exposed          view. To                    to
confirm or invalidate the truth of the workmen's assertion,
the excavation was carefully examined with lights, and break                                a

 Wakefield. The depth of the mine is one hundred and eighty
 yards; it has been worked many years; and being situated in
 elevated ground, has levels for drainage nearly as low as the
 river Calder, so that it is not very difficult to admit that the
 lizard might find a ready passage into the mine, and have
 sunk into a fissure in the coal, and remained there in a nearly
 torpid state till it was discovered in working the coal. Had

   The object of this paper, the author shows, is one that has
given rise to much controversy, and has been involved in much un
necessary mystery.       Paradoxes and apparent solecisms, when in
volved with facts and indubitable truths, will always be found, upon
accurate examination, to be near the surface, and to owe their ex
istence either to ambiguities of expression, or to the unperceived
adoption of some extraneous additions or limitations into the com
pound terms employed for definition, and which are subsequently
taken as constituent parts of their essence.

quantity whatever as negative per                         se,

to  mix few drops

        No one, I believe, was ever more distinguished in the important
    station of commanding those vessels which secure to England the
    commerce of nations unknown to former ages; nor did any one
    more largely contribute towards introducing the modern refinements
    of nautical astronomy, which skilfully pursued, and under favourable
    circumstances determine the place of a ship with greater accuracy,
     than what in the early part of the last century would have been
    thought amply sufficient for headlands, roadsteads, or harbours of the
    first importance.         And I cannot omit this opportunity of congratu
    lating    all  those who addict themselves               astronomical pursuits,

       The discovery of any new elementary substance has ever been
    deemed an occurrence worthy of being marked by some public de
    claration of applause.
       The ascertaining chlorine to be, in the actual state of our know
    ledge, one of this class, has justly been considered as among the
    most brilliant of Sir Humphry Davy's achievements in chemical sci
    ence.     Iodine has been added to the supporters of combustion, oc
    cupying, like oxygen and chlorine, the negative extremity of the scale
    in Electro-chemistry.
         More recently another substance, apparently intermediate be
    tween chlorine and iodine, has been derived from the same source as
    that yielding the latter, from the water of the sea; and from               pe                          its
    culiar odour denominated         brome,   and   subsequently   bromine. An

efficacy of telescopes constructed with fluid lenses, on the princi
ples developed in his two former papers, published in the Phil.
Trans., in separating double stars, resolving nebulae, and exhibiting
different appearances in the discs of the planets. He institutes, with
this view, a comparison between the performance of his telescope
of 8 inches aperture and 12 feet in length, with Mr. Herschel's
telescope, made with his new 20 inches speculum, and with Sir
James South's new refractor, of 12 inches aperture and 20 feet                                 fo
cal length. In Mr. Barlow's telescope m Persei, which is marked as
doublein South and Herschel's catalogue, is seen distinctly sextuple.
The stars composing a Orionis, marked in the catalogue as two dis
tinct sets of stars, each triple, are shown in Mr. Barlow's telescope as
being both quadruple, with two very fine stars between them. A
very fine double star was discovered by Mr. Herschel between the
two which compose 3 Capricorni, and was considered by him as a
very severe test: this star is seen distinctly in Mr. Barlow's tele
scope, but not double.
   Messier's 22nd nebula is resolved by Sir James South's tele
scope into an immense number of brilliant small stars. In Mr. Bar
low's telescope the same resolution is effected, though somewhat
less completely.
   The two last-mentioned instances he considers as affording ex
cellent criteria of the exact limits of the power of the instrument.
   Mr. Barlow next examined Jupiter and Mars in order to com
pare the defining powers of the two instruments.     Both these planets
were more   sharply   defined in Sir James South's telescope than in
that of the  author,  but in this respect the superiority of the former

shadow of one of     Jupiter's  satellites passing over his disc, there
was no apparent difference between the two instruments.           Their
powers seemed as nearly as possible equal when applied to Mars.
   An experience of three years has not shown the slightest per
ceptible change in either the quantity or quality of the fluid em
ployed   as the lens of the author's three-inch telescope; neither has
the glass inclosing it suffered any diminution of                       its

base of the encroaching cone. . This form the author designates
as the obtuse cone clipt at the base.
   Narrow valleys and plains are frequently divided by transverse
ledges of gravel. The formation of these is attributed to the opera
tion of rivers, which it is supposed had first accumulated their de
tritus in dams, and that these dams, having been successively broken
down after the subsidence of floods, were re-produced upon a rise
of the streams.                       -
   Numerous causes are assigned which vary the depth of streams.
These are, rains; the melting of Alpine snows and glaciers; the
breaking up of ice in rivers; and the bursting of lakes.
  III.--Whenever detritus is conveyed by running into standing
water, a separation takes place between those finer particles which
are held in suspension, and those which it only rolls along the
bottom.
   As the debris of horizontally stratified rocks forms a length
ened talus at their base, so the loose and heavy materials washed
down the side of a mountain, and conveyed into a lake, as soon as
they reach           its

 water Formation at Binstead, near Ryde, in the Isle     of Wight," by
 S. P. Pratt, Esq. F.G.S. F.L.S.
     The author lately discovered, in the lower and marly beds of the
 quarries of Binstead, in the Isle of Wight, and which belong to the
 lower fresh-water formation, a tooth of an Anoplotherium, and two
 teeth of the genus Palaeotherium, animals characteristic of strata of
 the same age in the Paris basin.
     These remains were accompanied, not only by several other frag
 ments of the bones of Pachydermata (chiefly in a rolled and         in
 jured state), but also by the jaw of a new species of Ruminantia,
 apparently closely allied to the genus Moschus.         From the oc
 currence of the latter fossil, the author infers that a race of ani
 mals existed at this geological epoch, whose habits required that
 the surface of the earth should have been in a very different state
 from that which it has been supposed to have presented, in con
 sequence of the frequent discovery of the remains of animals who
 lived almost entirely in marshes.
     Dec.  1-A   paper was read, entitled “An Explanatory Sketch
 of a   Geological  Map of Moravia, and the West of Hungary,” by
  Dr. A. Boué, For. Mem. G.S. &c.
     The author in presenting this Map to the Geological Society,
 states that it has been made with the assistance of Messrs. Teubner,
  Rittler, and Von Lill von Lilienbach ; and that with the latter
 gentleman in particular he has recently worked out many details,
 which it is hoped may rectify certain errors in the great Geological
 Map of Germany, published by Schropp of Berlin.
     Moravia has been in part described by André, Von Albin Hein
 rich, Von Lill, Von Oeynhausen, and Beudant; but the two last
 mentioned writers, it is stated, have not visited the country.
     This region is made up of the union of three principal chains
 of hills, the Eastern or Böhmerwaldgebirge, the Sudeten or Silesian
 mountains, and the Western Carpathians, the contact of the two
 first of which is hidden by a red sandstone of the coal-measures, and
 green, chalk marl.
    The hilly region called the Gesenke, consists of grauwacké, and
 extends across Moravia to near the Bohemian range. The Gesenke
 is separated from the Carpathians by the tertiary and alluvial val
 leys of the Upper Oder.
     The more ancient and longitudinal valleys, in Moravia, have a
 general direction from W.S.W. to E.N.E.; and are with some few
exceptions, cut through transversely by the present streams.
    In the part of Hungary and Gallicia indicated on this Map, the
rivers on the contrary flow for the most part in longitudinal valleys,
parallel to the Carpathians, as the Nitra, Gran, Vistula, and the
Waag, although the latter for a certain space runs through a trans
versal rent in primary rocks.
    In the Western groups are numerous Scotch and Scandina
vian minerals.     Many of the oldest stratified rocks are crossed
by large dyke-like elliptic bodies, running from south-west to
north-east. The respective characters of the primary Sudeten
and Tatra mountains are then described.          The grauwacké dis
                                                                 tricts

tricts are stated to differ little from those of the Hartz and the
South of Scotland; and the caverns which abound in the blueish gray
limestone, subordinate to this formation, may, the author conceives,
have been produced by the acidulous waters which are still so
abundant in the country, as at Gefatter Loch, &c.      This old lime
stone formation abounds in Madrepores, Caryophyllia, Encrinites,
and Orthoceratites.
   The author is of opinion, that the sienite was erupted during the
period between the formation of the grauwacké, and the primary
chain of Bohemia.     This sienite has very various characters, being
sometimes   porphyritic,  at other times associated with talcose and
quartzose rocks, &c.
   Above the sienite lies a coarse, red conglomerate, which is con
nected in Bohemia with a great deposit of red sandstone with
coal. Here the author corrects an error in Schropp's Map, where
the district is coloured as new red sandstone; instead of which, he
considers it to be of the age of the Scotch red coal-grits.
   The other coal deposit of the basin of the Oder is in aluminous
and bituminous slate, with gray sandstone, and many vegetable im
pressions, but without red sandstone.
   The Zechstein is wholly absent in these parts, and the true red
marl is very scarce.
  The Muschelkalk, however, occupies some space in Upper Silesia
and Poland, and contains most of its characteristic fossils.
  The Jurassic and Alpine limestones extend over a large portion
of the Map ; and the dolomite, the upper beds of which abound
with Madrepores, Encrinites, Diceras, and Terebratulae, is overlaid
by the Carpathian or Vienna sandstone (Andrychow, &c.).
   The Carpathian sandstone fills a cavity between a range of true
Alpine limestone on one side, and Jura limestone on the other, and
is easily divisible into three parts.
   1. The lowest division is marly and calcareous, containing Fu
coides intricatus and   F.furcatus, and has been mistaken on Schropp's
Map for transition limestone.       It is cut through by dykes of ser
  entine and greenstone.
   2. The middle group is more quartzose.
   3. The highest is characterized by reddish marls, several beds
of ruiniform, compact limestone, some Fucoides, Encrimites, Lepa
dites, Tellinites, resembling those of Solenhofen; Possidonia, Tere
bratulae, Ammonites, and Belemnites.       This triple system of the
Carpathians is overlaid by a group of sandstone which the author
considers to be the “green-sand;" this is composed of conglome
rate, nummulite limestone, and green, calcareous beds with Gry
phaea columba, Ostrea vesicularis, &c., also with superior beds re
sembling the Planer Kalk of the Germans.       The greensand of Mo
ravia has  all
            the characters       of
                              that   North-western Europe, pass
                                        of

                   a

to previous publications    of
                           his own, and   sections with which his

52          -            Geological Society.
   Chalk does not exist in the Carpathians, nor could the author
recognise   it at Cracow, the limestone of which he refers to the
Upper Jurassic, although he states that chalk is found in the plains
of Poland, Eastern Gallicia, Podolia, Volhynia, and Southern
Russia.
   The tertiary deposits of the countries described, though be
longing to two distinct basins, have everywhere the same cha
racters. The low grounds of Gallicia are supposed to have
formed a part of the great basin of Northern Europe, which must
have connected the Baltic with the Black Sea, and perhaps with
the seas and lakes of Asia. The tertiary beds of Moravia, on the
contrary, he considers to have been deposited in an arm of that
sea, which must have occupied the great depressions of Hungary
and Austria, communicating with the Mediterranean through Ba
varia and Switzerland, inasmuch as these deposits, whether on
the North or on the South of the Carpathians, have a common
character.    The various tertiary groups are identified with those
of the   sub-Apennines   ; the blue marls, and yellow, sandy marls,
besides the characteristic    shells, contain salt, sulphur, gypsum,
&c.; and in some parts there are freshwater shells, including the
Mytilus of the Danube. In respect to the place of the salt of
Wieliczka, the author, differing from MM. von Lill and Keferstein,
who had placed it in the Carpathian sandstone, considers it to be
 of tertiary age, because it is associated with sub-Apennine shells,
and is connected with upper marine sandstone, and limestone.
  Above the blue saliferous marls is a vast extent of molasse with
Pectens, Ostreat, and many fossil vegetables. The beds of this de
K.    are highly inclined along the foot of the Carpathians.   At
  icholschitz and Krepitz in Moravia, and at Zazlusin, and Dobro
mil in Gallicia, it is represented by marly, siliceous deposits, with
semiopal, and fishes, as well as Hymenopterous, Dipterous, and
Coleopterous insects.
   The sandy banks, with Ostrea, and Cerithii, which abound in
Moravia, Hungary and Gallicia, are referred to an age interme
diate between the blue saliferous marl and the molasse just de
scribed, and are considered to be older than the conglomerates-
and coral limestone of Austria.
   The older alluvium of these districts, and particularly that of the
valley of the Oder, besides boulders and gravel, contains, existing
species of fresh-water shells mixed in beds of marl with bones of ex
tinct animals and fossils.
   Of basaltic rocks, the cone of Randenberg is scoriaceous, and has
been protruded through grauwacké.         Near Barrow a felspathose
rock has pierced the Carpathic sandstone, converting it into jaspi
deous rocks resembling those of the Giant's Causeway, and the
Isle of Skye, &c.
   The author refers to M. Beudant for full particulars of the tra
chyte, but begs to distinguish certain, trachytic conglomerates, as
being of aqueous origin, from the trachytic or igneous breccia.

from time to time to publish in the cheapest form an abstract from
the most interesting of these communications; and they trust that
the first of these papers will be ready for delivery on the first of
January, 1831. They further propose, that these meetings shall
take place on the second and fourth Tuesdays in every month; and
they have invited, for the 9th of November next, such members
of the Society as appeared likely, from their scientific pursuits, to
take an interest in their views.
   “The Council have moreover suggested that letters be sent to

above-mentioned species, namely, Ort. virginianus, californicus,
neorenus and Montezumae, had been exhibited in a living state in the

were still alive there, having braved the severity of the last winter
without any artificial warmth. They were     natives              all

amined ; some previous preparation of that part having been
deemed necessary, in order to render it sufficiently firm for dis
section.
  The structure of the laryna is minutely described, and contrasted
with the anatomy of the same part in the Chimpanzee, in which
the laryngeal sacs are not developed as in the Orang. The left
laryngeal sac in the present instance was the largest, and extended
over the top of the sternum. In the Chimpanzee the laryngeal sac
is produced into a cavity in the body of the os hyoides, presenting
the first indication of the excavation which is carried to so great an
extent in the Monkeys of the genus Mycetes. The thyroid gland is
small in the Orang. The lungs are entire on each side, and not
divided into lobes. The aorta gives off by a common trunk the
right subclavian and the right and the left carotid arteries, the
latter of which is given off in the Chimpanzee, as in man, from the
arch of the aorta.
     In the course of his illustrations of the anatomical differences
which exist between the Orang and the Chimpanzee, Mr. Owen
frequently referred to Tyson's “Anatomy of a                           and con          {ij},
firmed      many    of the descriptions   given in that work.

    This latter species was observed to deviate in general colour and
 markings from the European species, although according in form;
 and in the former characters to exhibit a manifest approach to the
 Nutcrackers, or the genus Nucifraga of Brisson.
    A new species of this latter European form was also observed in
 the collection; a second species being thus added to a group which
had hitherto been supposed to have been limited to one.               In the
shape of the bill, which was somewhat shorter and stouter at the
base than in the European species, it indicated an approach to the
Jays. Its characters were as follow:—
   NUCIFRAGA HEMISPILA.             Nuc. castaneo-brunnea ; capite subtus,
      collo  anteriori, dorso,  pectoreque  albo maculatis; capite summo,
      alis, rectricibusque intense brunneis; his, duabus mediis exceptis,
      ad apicem late albis.
   The two following species of Woodpecker, which approached in
size and colouring most closely to the European green Woodpecker,
were also described.

   A species of Hawfinch, according accurately with the characters
of that northern form, was also described.

   Among the forms peculiar to India was observed a second spe
cies of the singular group which contains the Horned Pheasant, or
the Meleagris Satyra of Tinnaeus, and which has been lately sepa
rated by M. Cuvier under the name of Tragopan. Its specific cha
racters are ;

   A species of true Pheasant, which seems to have been indicated
by former writers from incomplete descriptions or drawings, but
never to have been accurately characterized, was also exhibited
and named.
   PHAsiaNUs ALBo-cRISTATUs.               Mas. Phas, supra ater, viridi
      nitore splendens; dorso imo albo-fasciato; cristae plumis albis,

   A third species was likewise added from the collection to the
group of Enicurus of M. Temminck, which has hitherto been con
sidered as limited in range to the Indian Archipelago. The fol
lowing are    itscharacters:—
   ENicuRUs MACULATUs. En. capite, collo, dorso superiori, pec

which is not found in the Chimpanzee, and has been asserted to
exist in man alone. Other peculiarities are met with, in the absence
of a crista galli on the ethmoid bone, and in the non-existence of
either mastoid or styloid processes: there is a process from the ar
ticular surface of the temporal bone, which is necessary to prevent
dislocation backwards of the lower jaw, the auditory process not
being adapted to prevent such an accident.         The intermaxillary
bones are distinct. There are     large foramina behind the deciduous
teeth, which lead to cavities containing the permanent ones; the
crowns of the latter are as large as those of the Pongo. The os
nasi is single and triangular; it has a strong spine at the back part.
There are three infra-orbital foramina ; and large foramina in the
malar bone. The anterior condyloid foramina are two on each side.
   The true vertebrae are 23: 7 cervical, with long simple spines;
12 dorsal; and 4 lumbar. There are 8 false vertebrae, viz. 5 sacral,
and 3 coccygeal. The ribs are 12; 7 true, and 5 false.              The
sternum is composed, below the first portion, of a double series of
bones alternating with each other: the same structure obtains in
the Pongo.
    The spine of the scapula is strongly incurvated upwards. The
bones of the arm and hand are much elongated.           The thumb is
 short; the proximal phalanges of the fingers bent.
    The ilia are narrow, flattened, and elongated. The femur is short
 and straight; it has no ligamentum teres, a deficiency which occurs
also in the Elephant, the Sloths, in Seals, the Walrus, Ornithorhyn
chus, &c., and by which a greater extent of motion is allowed to
the thigh. The tibia and fibula are shorter than the femur: these,
like the bones of the fore-arm, have a greater interosseous space
than is found in man. The patella is very small.      The os calcis pro
jects far behind.    The bones of the metatarsus and the phalanges
are elongated, the first series of the latter being bent. The hinder
thumb is very short : in the individual examined it had a metatar
sal bone, and two phalanges. A nail existed on the thumb of each
 hinder hand.
    Dec. 14.—G. B. Greenough, Esq. in the Chair. A letter was
 read from Dr. Andrew Smith, addressed to N. A. Vigors, Esq. The
 following are extracts:
    “Cape Town, 8th Sept. 1830–I am sure you will be pleased to
learn that I have discovered another species of Macroscelides, as
well as a new one of Erinaceus ; and three species of the genus
 Otis, together with one of Brachypteryx.  The descriptions of these
I  hope to be able to forward to you in the course of three weeks or
a month. The first is designated in our Museum, Macroscelides      ru

    The following observations, by Mr. Yarrell, on the subject of his
attempts to preserve Whitebait alive, were read.
   “Several dozens of strong lively fish, four inches in length, were
transferred with great care from the nets into large vessels, (some
of the vessels, to vary the experiments, being of earthenware, and
others of wood and metal,) filled with water taken from the Thames
at the time of catching the fish. At the expiration of twenty mi
nutes nearly the whole of them were dead, none survived longer
than half an hour; and all fell to the bottom of the water.       On
examination, the air-bladders were found to be empty and collapsed.
There was no cause of death apparent.       About four dozen speci
mens were then placed in a coffin-shaped box pierced with holes,
which was towed slowly up the river after the fishing-boat.      This
attempt also failed :                    all
                           the fish were dead when the vessel had
reached Greenwich.
     “Iwas told               by
                    two Whitebait fishermen that they had several
times placed these fishes     the wells   their boats, but they inva

ash, 36 parts yield 100 of ammonia, and yet it contains no ammo
nia; by the same treatment 100 parts give 82 of oxalic acid, and it
contains no oxalic acid. These curious properties connect oxamide,
on one hand, with the well known formation of ammonia by treating
animal matter with potash; and on the other, with the production of

oxalate of potash and ammonia; sulphuric acid converts it into
sulphate of ammonia, carbonic acid and carbonic oxide: and these
changes appear to be effected by the addition of the vapour of water
in the proportions above stated.
  Many animal substances, such as albumen, gelatin, fibrin, &c.,
act with potash precisely like oxamide, and the uric and hippuric
acids much resemble it in this respect.  M. Dumas is occupied in

   The injurious effects of jewelled holes in watches and chrono
meters have been long observed. (See Nicholson's Journal, vol. vii.
p. 208.)   It seems that, however perfect the polishing may be,
sooner or later the hard substance of the jewel grinds and cuts the
steel pivot; and the metallic particles, by mixing with the oil, ren
der it unfavourable for action; and this effect is the more likely to
take place the nearer the pivots are to the maintaining power. Holes
made of brass are objectionable, on account of the liability of this
metal to oxidation.        Gold is too soft for the purpose. What seems
to be required

 a little before five o'clock, a rumbling, protracted, and moderately
 loud sound was heard, but no shock was perceived.        A few fleecy
 stationary clouds were observed, which disappeared in the evening.
 Many inhabitants were busy in pitching tents, and some in placing
, wagons, in the squares of Cape Town, in which they slept during
 some weeks.     The night was very fine and calm, the sky without
clouds, and the stars shone uncommonly clear.
   Much interest was excited by what was said to have been ob
served at Jan Biesjes Kraal, and at Blauweberg's Valley.        It was
stated “that the earth had opened, that volcanic eruptions had
taken place, that craters had been formed, and that lava had issued!"
Numbers of persons flocked to these spots, and went also on the                             I
9th to examine them; but what I found fell considerably short of
what I expected from the wonderful accounts I had heard, yet was
nevertheless remarkable and interesting.     Near the Kraal found                                             I
rents and fissures in the ground, one of which I followed for about
the extent of a mile. In some places they were more than an inch
wide, and in others much less. In many places was able to push                              I
into them, in a perpendicular direction, a switch to      full length,                           its

informed that they had observed these fissures        the morning                           on                          of

     AURORAE  BoaeALEs.-At 9 o'clock in the evening of the 1st instant, a
bright   aurora borealis appeared between the North and West, behind a
 low cirrostratus cloud, which it enlightened in some attenuated places, and
 several very bright patches were seen in the horizon.                At 18 minutes
past nine the first column of light emanated from it (whose bearing was due
North) to an altitude of about 16 degrees, and was succeeded by ten or
 twelve more perpendicular columns of various breadths between that point
 and the magnetic north during a peculiarly bright moon-light, the moon's
 altitude being from 25 to 30 degrees, and only 28 hours beyond her opposi
 tion with the sun. It has been much doubted whether the coruscations
of an aurora can be seen in this latitude after the first, or before the last
two or three days of the moon’s age; but in this instance the strong
lunar light had but little influence in diminishing the splendour of these
flame-coloured columns.            The sky became overcast by 10 o’clock, and
did   away     its
                appearance.
    At half-past seven           the evening
                                        in        the 4th,    of                 an
                                                               aurora was observed
between the North and West, and increased                brighness till eight, when
                                                                           in

altitude      of
              22   degrees.       Several other columns   successively rose between
that point and the true North till           quarter past eight,

                                                      the aurora did not disappear
till nine. Two bright trained meteors appeared over                 and the thermo        it,
meter rose one degree.               faint aurora appeared
                                             A                  the evening      thein                                of

THE   comparison of the end of the last with the beginning
  of the present volume, has not led to any corrections
worthy of being here mentioned, with the single exception
(the calculation of the sun's ephemeris having been finished
before a small alteration in the tables of correction was pub
blished), that in this volume the sidereal time at the mean noon
is to be corrected by —0"-06.       The two preceding volumes
gave it correctly. All other discrepancies       within the limits     lie
which are attainable       our tables   by present      as   at
                                                   constructed.

                the single parts has remained almost exactly
the same     before. The most important difference

     This manner of estimating the light of a planet         seems to be
 more convenient, because the small planets are principally ob
 served during their oppositions, and the numbers show at
 once whether they are nearer or more distant.               Prof. Bessel
has been very attentive to the appearance of Ceres and Pallas
 at the times of their opposition in 1830. Ceres had the 7th
                  -
 or 8th, Pallas the 8th or 9th magnitude; consequently, when
 their light is      1, neither of them will much differ from the
 8th magnitude; and the comparison of the light of Pallas at
 the opposition of 1831, when it will be only one-third of the
 former, will afford a measure of the actual decrease of the light,
as compared with the numbers by which the intensity of light
1s expressed.
     M. Wolfers has for this year also executed a great part
of the calculations, namely, the ephemeris of the sun, four
months of the moon's geocentric positions, the calculations for
Jupiter's satellites, and the superior older planets. To M.
 Herter I am again indebted for the positions of the moon

   The somewhat smaller number of occultations of stars
this year does not arise from        less careful research, but

   The quantities      m, r and 8 must be interpolated            by the me
ridian difference from Berlin.             For the greater accuracy of
these and other reductions,         the quantity ºr has been accurately
interpolated, and expressed in tenths of seconds for the time of
the culmination in the tables headed ‘Auxiliary Tables for
the Occultations of Stars.”
    Finally, I beg leave to observe that for the more easy distinc
tion of the inferior culminations of the moon, the letter U has
been entirely omitted; and that, for the same reason, to the
marks of the moon's quarters the following letters have been
added:

 but it is not possible to trace the slightest distinction between
 the red rocks at West Ord or Berwick Castle, and those con

 From the enumeration of the rocks which occur at West
 Ord, Berwick Castle, the sea-coast, both on the north and
 south of the harbour, on the hill at Sunnyside, and the shaft

XVII.   On the alleged Production of Heat in Mines by the Con
  densation of the Air which ventilates them; and on the Fallacy
  of other Objections to the Opinion that a high Temperature
  exists in the Interior of the Globe.                         By Robert W. Fox.
   To    the   Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
        Gentlemen,
A PAPER
      “On
      view”
                   has recently appeared in the Edinburgh Re
                     the Progress of Geological Science,” in which
arguments are adduced against the existence of an elevated
temperature in the interior of the earth.
   These arguments are founded on the cold which prevails
about the poles, notwithstanding they are twelve miles nearer
the centre than the surface of the earth is at the equator; and
on the comparatively low temperature of the water in aban
donded mines, as well as at the bottom of the sea, as far as
this has been ascertained.
   It is at the same time admitted that the heat is found to                                       in
crease in mines in proportion as they are deepened, and that
its degree depends                on
                             their depth under the surface, rather
than with respect             to
                          the level              of
                                         the sea. That         not pro        it    is
duced         by
             the  miners,    and the candles and       gunpowder   they
use,     fully
        is      acknowledged,                   as
                                       the influence      those causes      of
must     beperfectly insignificant                   on
                                           the large quantity     water                  of
pumped out              of
                   deep mines.
   But the reviewers attribute the elevation               temperature      of
observed        mines to the condensation of the currents of air
                   in
 which ventilate them. “Now,” they say, “as this air passes
from the surface              to

bottom will              be
                     greatest,    because there the     compression                                 is
greatest.      The greater the quantity                            of

          Mr. R. W. Fox               on the Increase         of Heat in      Mines.        95
for the purpose of showing that neither the hypothesis, nor
the objections derived from the temperature of abandoned
mines, are tenable.
  I   do not apprehend that a degree of pressure equal to what
takes place in our deepest mines would raise the temperature
of air many degrees, probably not more than five or six at the
 utmost, supposing none of the heat to escape to surrounding
 bodies; but the water flows into some of our mines in consi
 derable streams at the temperature of from 80° to 90°, which
 is about 30° to 40° above that of the climate: and nearly two
 millions of gallons are daily pumped from the bottom of Pol
 dice mine, which is 176 fathoms deep, at 99° to 100°.     This
 being warmer than the human body, of course puts that source
 of heat out of the question; and it often happens that streams
 of water, the moment they gush into mines, are equal and
 sometimes superior in temperature to the air immediately in
  contact with them.
     Neither do the seasons seem to produce any sensible effect
  in deep mines, which they doubtless would do if the heat
  were in almost any degree attributable to the compression of
  the air.                       -
      Our mines are for the most part ventilated by shafts open
ing into the levels or galleries from the surface or from a
higher level. These shafts are commonly numerous in ex
tensive mines, and the air circulates freely and often copiously
through them, ascending in some shafts, and descending in
others.         In     all   cases,
                                  I     believe that the upward currents                    are
     higher temperature than the downward ones;
                                                                              in so

minish, and not to augment their temperature. The air sup
plied by mechanical means is comparatively trifling; this mode

twelve degrees for the extreme, even supposing equal quan

rived from the upper levels and workings of mines. The
levels are usually driven on the veins at intervals of ten fathoms
under the adits; the superior ones being more extended in
length than the inferior; so that they are likely to intercept
most of the waters coming from the ground above; and the
water following that course which opposes the least resistance
may be supposed to pass principally through the uppermost
levels into the shafts, and to sink therein, if      relative tem                  its

   Thus the geographical latitude of the pole of the axis of

the obliquity of the ecliptic vary eternally within limits which
in fact are extremely narrow, and thus the stability of the
system is preserved.
   I  have only shown these results to be true when the earth
is supposed   to revolve in a medium absolutely devoid of                                                          all

 Mr. Brayley’s communication           may be, he should have been
 more gratified by “the breach than the observance” of this
 instance of civility; not because he had any aversion to his
 opinion on the origin of rock-basins undergoing the test of
 investigation, but because it was obviously improper to render
 a work on topography the vehicle of controversy by the
 writers of
                 it;
                 and also,             as   he

constituent parts of granite;” but he adds, “in time the
accumulated gravel is blown away by the winds, although
in the deeper hollows it may often be found forming consider
able accumulations.”          In the first place, I very much doubt
whether it be      really   a fact that gravel of this description is
always found in these excavations, and indeed Dr. MacCul
loch's own remark seems to imply that it is not; for why
does he observe that in time the accumulated gravel is blown
away, if it were always found there? But                        suppose the      let   us

104          Mr. Moore's              Remarks on the Origin                    of lock-basins,
on these flat surfaces, some of which, as Dr. MacCulloch ob
serves, “are as regularly spheroidal internally as if they had
been shaped by a turning lathe,” and it may be added some
of which also are several feet in diameter",—to the reception
of this proposition my power of credence,                confess, is not           I
equal.    I see  here,  indeed,    a  theory   supported    by a distin
guished name, but by no sufficient proof.             Mr. Brayley him
self states a fact in direct hostility to this hypothesis. There
are granite beds, it seems, which present basins on their per
pendicular faces (“Devon,” p. 292–294); and water might
indeed be arrested there by a miracle, but if it followed the
course which nature requires, it would certainly descend, and
leave the rock as before.          Some other cause therefore must
necessarily be sought for, to account for the production of these
basins at least.
   But if we are to suppose that rock-basins can be formed
by “the presence of water, and the alternate action of air and
water,” and              if,
                     Mr. Brayley affirms, “we need not hesitate
                               as

what state ought we         find the granite

the contrary, as my correspondent before quoted observes,
“ the basins are not only often of very regular figure, but are
cut in the hardest rocks, where no other derangement of the
surface is visible. And they are also very distinguishable from
the hollows worn in the softer parts of some rocks by the
effects of weather.”    These cavities are not only, as Dr. Mac
Culloch   states,  occasionally  circular in their boundary, and
as regularly   spheroidal  internally  as if they had been shaped
in a turning lathe, but their sides also are smooth and even;
and these circumstances appear to me to be decisive of the
question. Dr. MacCulloch, it is true, ascribes this regularity
of form to “the uniform texture of the granite.”            Now the
constituent   parts of the  granite  which most   generally  prevails
in  Devonshire,   are stated to be  quartz, felspar and  mica;   and
we are told that these several materials are of different de
grees of hardness. Mr. Brayley has spoken of “the felspar of
the base as dull, earthy and decomposing” (“Devon,” p. 251),
and of another of the decomponent parts as “almost indestruc
tible.” This being the case, then, I maintain that the decom
position, which is admitted to be going on at present as here
tofore, would necessarily follow the softer particles of the rock;
and the consequence would be, that the figure of the cavities
in question would become, in                           all
                                      cases, irregular, and bear

and      Dr. MacCulloch describes them. And not only would
they      irregular     their form, but the surface       these ca                         of
vities would also       rough  be in
                               and  crumbly,    the   “soft, earthy
part having decayed,” and left the “indestructible” portions
projecting.     But this not the fact; and Mr. Brayley has ac
                                       is
cordingly admitted (“Devon,”        290) that         p.

rounded by the action of the elements. This fact is obviously
conclusive,” &c. Not having seen these cavities,     shall not                                     I
venture to give any opinion decidedly respecting them. From
Mr. Brayley's description of them they appear to be very                                                          ir
regular, and           if he
                        had not said that he did not find their sides
crumbly, I should be disposed to consider them as belonging
to that class of excavations which have been formed by natural
causes.          If
               their origin were artificial, it is possible the ridges
might have been left through want of sufficient skill to re
move them; or, the softer parts of the rock may perhaps have
been since worn away by the action of the weather, leaving the
porphyry projecting.           But at any rate the reasoning from
these does not appear to me to apply to the rock-basins in
Devonshire, where, though the component parts of the granite
are said to differ greatly in durability, no projections occur.
 From the former of these instances therefore no serious ob
jection appears to arise to the artificial origin of the latter.
    Mr. Brayley, indeed, has himself felt a difficulty on this sub
ject; for admitting the insufficiency of Dr.MacCulloch's theory,
he has proposed another objection to                    saying (“Devon,”
                                                                  it,    by

Mr. Brayley is of opinion        that Dr. MacCulloch has rendered

of granite, may be unquestionably spheroidal; but to infer

Iam not disposed to lay any undue stress on this opinion, and
have undertaken the defence of it with reluctance. One or two
other facts, however,                        in support                       of    it,      may       be   added.            The

lieve, that made any attempt to account for the origin and de
sign of these cavities, rejects the notion that they were used
for libations of blood, wine, honey, or oil, and thinks they
were intended to collect water from the rains or dews, in the
greatest purity, for the purpose of ablutions, which were very
common among the priests of                                  all

                             the mechanical arts.      We learn, for
instance, from Caesar, who could not              mistaken, that they        be

and authenticity.  Not considering him therefore a guide that
could be always followed with safety, I have referred to other
and higher authorities. At the same time I am far from think
ing this writer to be deserving of contempt.     His learning
and the general extent of his researches entitle his opinions
to attention.    I must also be permitted to add, that      have                                I
not rested the  proof  of the existence of Druidism in the West
of England on the existence of rock-basins, or on any other
British remains in this district, but on the consideration, that
as this superstition constituted the religion of the ancient                                         in
habitants of this island, it was matter of course that it pre

        THE      distribution of the rocks usually considered
             of volcanic origin, in the different formations,
                                                                  as

during the earlier   ºff:
such as to indicate the    greater  prevalence   of volcanic agency
                                and the relations of the actual vol
canic vents are such as to prove that these are only the resi
dual portion of a much larger number which have coexisted
in the antecedent epochs.
    Observations.—This article ought strictly to have occupied
an earlier place in my arrangement, and to have immediately
followed No. IV. but as it will be seen that many causes tend to
throw obscurity on this part of our subject, and to prevent
our arriving at more than approximate results,        I have judged
this departure from a more exact method justifiable, as I have
thus been enabled to give precedence to the evidence which ap
peared to me most clear and satisfactory. From the intrusive
position of these rocks, which appear very frequently to have
been injected among the strata which they traverse, subse
quently to the deposition of those strata, a difficulty arises, in
limine, as to the determination of their age. We know them to
be subsequent to the beds traversed; but who shall say how
much so?      In order to ascertain this point, the junction of
these beds with the succeeding formations should be carefully
 examined, and the exact geological point noted where these
intruding masses are cut off and cease to traverse those for
mations. For instance, if a trap dyke shall be found travers
 ing the coal measures, but cut off by the incumbent mag
 nesian limestone, we may then be sure that the cause which
 produced this dyke was in action before the deposition of the
 magnesian limestone. We have, however, hitherto few obser
 vations to this effect; but it yet seems to me that an approxi
 mation is attainable; for we find that the rocks usually con
 sidered as igneous, materially vary in their characters in the
 different formations; granite occurring most generally in asso
 ciation with the rocks termed primitive; peculiar greenstones'
 and porphyries with those of transition; others again with
 some varieties of basalt in the coal formation.      Now whenever
 we find peculiar varieties always associated with a single for
 mation, and excluded from the contiguous formations of more
 recent date, we may fairly, I think, infer that their production
 has taken place almost contemporaneously with that of the
 formations in which they so occur; yet it must be owned

the different varieties of trap pass into each other by such
insensible gradations, that much doubt must often hang over
the subject.
   In the so called primitive epoch, we find a very large pro
portion, universally distributed, of rocks which have been re
ferred to an igneous origin by evidence which has produced
an increasing effect on the minds of geologists, the more at
tentively it has been examined and weighed.        speak prin                      I
cipally of the granitic rocks; but I think we must refer most
of the felspathic and amphibolic series to this class. From their
general relations, we may probably consider most of these
rocks as having originated antecedently to the transition
period; but I am far from supposing that any of them are
necessarily confined to this age; on the contrary, I believe
many granitic rocks, those especially passing into sienite, to
belong generally to the transition period, and some to even
younger epochs”.
   The transition period likewise embraces a very large pro
portion of rocks, such as greenstones, sienites, &c., apparently
of igneous origin; though here again the same difficulty as
to limiting their exact age presents itself: for instance, in
Pembrokeshire the graywacke is extensively associated with
greenstone, which latter, when it approaches the superjacent
carboniferous limestone, breaks through           thus demonstrat       it,
ing     more recent origin. Yet when we take

              of                                    igneous origin,      of
which universally occur associated with them, occupying ge
nerally nearly one-fifth                of
                            these districts, with the much smaller

                the igneous rocks     the more recent formations,

duced them were              in   much more active operation                       in   the earlier
period.
     The carboniferous   series still embrace many trap rocks,
though        far less proportion, and much more limited                                             to

the trap of Tortworth in Gloucestershire, though it nearly ap
proaches the Bristol coal-field, yet appears to be limited to
the transition group.
   In the carboniferous districts our former difficulties again
recur in limiting the age of the associated trap. In one                                       in
stance, the Cleaveland trap dyke (in the north of Yorkshire)
traverses not only the coal-measures, but also the incumbent
red marl, lias, and inferior oolite. We must however, think,                              I
consider far the greater part of the trap rocks to have been
produced before the age of these formations; for how other
wise can we account for the absence of trap in these last,

      Brongniart is also of opinion that the period of activity of
   the extinct volcanos of Auvergne belonged to the close of the
  tertiary rather than the commencement of the actual epoch;
  and believes it to have preceded the action of the causes,
  whatever they may have been, which produced the vast accu
  mulations of gravel, which he designates “Clysmien,” a term
  which, having the fear of Mr. Lyell before my eyes, I dare
  not translate ‘diluvial' (Tabl. p. 364). He admits, however,
  that any well authenticated example of the lava of those vol
  canos actually overlying the said gravel, would negative this
  presumption; but contends that the instances hitherto cited
  have been only beds of volcanic fragments, which might readily
  originate in the same causes which produced gravel of the
  other rocks.                                                     -
      Proceed we now to the volcanic vents which still continue
  in a state of activity.   If we compare the proportion of the
  surface   actually thus occupied   with that of one-fifth, which
  we have seen must have prevailed in the primitive and tran
  sition periods, we shall again have a ratio which I can only
  express as tangent: cotangent of the infinitesimal part of a
  second, which (as far as     I am acquainted) the advocates of
  existing causes alone consider as that of equality. It might
 however be objected that this is an unfair view of the case;
 that in all the earlier formations we have the accumulated
 products of the volcanic action of many remote successive
 ages of immense duration; that perhaps but a very small
 proportion of this total resulted from the volcanos of any
 one single age; and that the new vents which have in the
 actual aera succeeded to those now extinct may, therefore,
 be as numerous as those which previously existed at any
 single date. But to this we answer, that if the actual sites be
 examined, far from appearing to be new vents which have re
 placed extinct old ones, they will be found to be only small
 residual portions of much more extensive volcanic districts,
 which appear from the rocks characterizing them, trachyte,
 basalt, &c., to have been contemporaneous with those of      Au
vergne, the Rhine, &c. Thus in Iceland, Hecla only is active;
but the whole island is obviously the product of ancient vol
 canos.     In Italy, Vesuvius occupies but a small part of the
 Campi Phlegraei; and there are many other like districts near
 Rome, about the Alban lake, &c. &c. On this subject I can
not do better than quote the very words of Brongniart, whose
 authority deserves the more attention, as he has most care
fully studied the whole subject, and drawn up one of the most

regret that, in a note to one of my communications,

I have      to
           observe:    first,   with  regard     my  quotation  from  to
Strabo.     Iam inexpressibly surprised that Mr. Lyell should
consider              as
              altogether unconnected with the passage
             it                                                                                        to
which    has referred. Strabo concludes the general argu
            he
ment, which Mr. Lyell has     ably condensed,     alleging
                                                  so                                   by

volutions which we have just stated to be the causes of the
deluges and the like catastrophes which have been mentioned
at the Lipari Islands, &c., it is worth while to produce for
eomparison yet more examples of the like nature which exist
or have happened in other places.” Strabo, vol. i. p. 83, 84.
ed. Ox. One of the first examples thus introduced (at the
top   of the very next page) is the    case of the volcanic elevation
of the  country  about   Methone,      which                   I
                                                have myself quoted:
under these circumstances, it certainly appears to me per
fectly impossible for any one to have carefully verified my
quotation, in the connection in which it stands, without being
necessarily conducted to the general argument abridged by
Mr. Lyell, of which as an illustration it certainly does form
an essential part.          I
                         should have been quite at a loss to con
ceive how      I
               could myself, as I have done, make this singular
omission, did not Mr. Lyell now suggest a cause, by showing
that the passage had been before quoted by Raspe; from whom,
therefore,     I
              candidly confess that I now suppose I must have
taken it at second-hand, without even the trouble of verifica
tion.              I

118   Mr. S. Sharpe              on the tidelike Wave        of Lake Ontario.
  The observations               he records   are:
  1st,   Observed by Mr. Gourlay; at the Whirpool there was
a tide of three feet every four or five minutes.
   2ndly, by Dr. Bigsby; a mile below the Whirlpool there
was a flux and reflux of a foot every three or four minutes.
   3rdly, by Mr. Gourlay, confirmed by Dr. Bigsby; at Queen
ston Wharf, on the river Niagara, there was a constant ebbing
and flowing of one foot in a minute.
   4thly, Related by Mr. Gourlay on the report of others,
that the tide of Nappanee took fifty minutes to flow and a
hundred minutes to ebb.
   Now if we suppose these undulations to be caused by the
wind, and that like water in a basin, when it is highest on one
side it is lowest on the other, the distance from shore to shore
                                      i.
will be similar to half the space between the tops of two waves
in the ocean, and having           distance given, we may by com
parison with the pendulum learn the time of undulation.
   As the first and second observations were made at different
times, though at the same place, the wind had probably been
blowing with different force, which accounts for the disagree
ment in the height to which the waves rose; and might have
been blowing in different directions; in one case more along
the lake, and in the other more across                     it,
                                                 which might account
for the difference of the time.
   Let   us   compare these two observations with the theory,
neglecting the last two, which were made             different places;
                                                                  at

120        Dr. Smith's                    Observations relative to the
Saap or Saan; and history describes a portion thereof under
the appellation of Bushmen, to which, as a subdivision of the
former, the following remarks are intended to apply.
   The term Bushman, or more properly Bosjiesman, is of
Dutch origin, and commonly employed at present by the
colonists to designate a native of the wild and savage tribes
residing immediately beyond the northern boundary of the
colony, and supporting themselves either by plunder or the
spontaneous productions of nature.     The time when such
communities    began  to exist must ever remain a matter of
conjecture, yet it is certain that they occurred at an early
period; for we find that the histories of such hordes are familiar
to the better disposed Hottentots even far in advance of the
colony, and stated by them to have existed from time
immemorial.     Considering the manner in which their num
bers are at  present  occasionally increased, we may, without
much danger of error, attribute their origin partly to the
consequences of war and poverty, and partly to the association
of characters whom crime induced to seek a refuge in the
desert, or the habits of a better state of society expelled from
itshaunts.       very early times the part
                   In                            the country now       of
known    to us as the chief resort of the Bushmen was more
densely populated than            present, and the outrages and
violences  perpetrated                    by   its at
                                  inhabitants were, according                           to
tradition, even more frequent and horrible than they now are.
In  such days also, the barren districts lying between the                        Oli
phant and Groone Rivers, now long way within the boundary
                                                        a
of the colony, together with various other spots near the west
ern coast, were peopled                        by
                                 such characters; and the Great
 Karoo,    as well     the      as

122            Dr. Smith's Observations relative to       the
races themselves. The number of inhabitants is small, com
pared with the great extent of country over which they are
scattered, and which consists of the whole of that extensive
plain lying between the northern boundary of the colony—
the Kamiesberg range of mountains, and the confines of the
Orange River. The distribution of the population varies
according to the season of the year, the supply of game, and
the relation of the tribes to the surrounding inhabitants.             In
situations where nature        is liberal of  productions  convertible to
the    support    of  man,    something    like small communities are
occasionally met with; but in places again, where food is
 scanty, or water defective, it is rare to find more than one or
 at least two families together; and those having little or no
 intercourse with their neighbours, unless when self-defence, or
 the spoils of some marauding expedition bring them for a time
 into contact. The fact of their being usually dispersed in
 such small parties when friendly and well disposed, and of
 their associating in hordes or troops when projecting and
 executing mischief, or enjoying the spoils often consequent
 upon that, frequently furnishes the farmer with a fair guide for
 judging of their views, and often enables him to discover the
 retreat of thieves, where those themselves had in the first
  instance escaped detection.
      The little intercourse which they thus have with each other,
  and the absence of almost every kind of property, render
  them quite strangers to the great objects of laws, and con
  sequently unconscious of the benefits of a regular Government.
  They have, therefore, really either hereditary or permanently
  elected rulers; and few, if any, of them are disposed to acknow
  ledge any superiority, except that which physical strength may
   secure.    In situations where a temporary leader is advan
   tageous, and which they consider as only so in war or the
   chace, they unconsciously give place in the former to the
   bravest and most dexterous, and in the latter to the most ex
   perienced and cunning.           They have no established laws by
   which offences are     tried,  nor determined punishments by which
   aggressions are avenged; every individual is his own lawgiver,
   and every crime is punished according to the caprice of the
   sufferer, or the relative positions and relations of the impli
   cated parties.      The absence of everything like system ren
   ders punishments amongst them very unequal, and often ex
    tremely disproportionate         to the crimes they are employed
    to retribute.    It permits injuries of the highest older often to
    be inflicted   with  impunity, and others of the most insignifi
    cant character to be visited with the most hideous vengeance;

of   apprehension and fear. They appear                       survey every        to a

calculated for the guidance of man in a state of actual civili
zation.
    Most Bushmen pertinaciously avoid every communication
with foreigners, and resort to the most unfrequented and
inaccessible spots, upon the actual or even supposed approach
thereof.    They are deeply versed in deceit, and treacherous
in the  extreme,   being always prepared to effect by guile and
perfidy what they otherwise are unable to accomplish*.         Such
treachery, however, though glaringly conspicuous, appears
certainly to be resorted to more as a means suggested by rea
son and observation, to compensate for the inequality that ex
ists between them and their more powerful neighbours, than
to proceed from the operation of abstract vicious and disho
nourable principles. They are, therefore, not divested of that
which under other circumstances such attainments would give
                                                                                                            in all

high degree; and so accustomed are they to exercise of an
active description, that their swiftness becomes remarkable,
and their power of continuing it truly astonishing, being such
as to enable most of them to keep pace with horses even for
days in succession, and often to drive off cattle with more
celerity than pursuers can follow. The disposition to laziness
so decidedly characteristic of the more regular Hottentots, is
equally developed in the Bushmen; and were it not the ab
solute necessity of daily exertion to procure the scanty means
of subsistence, they would doubtless pass their time in indolent
practices similar to those pursued where resources are more
certain and productive.
    The continual use to which they apply the eyes and ears,
not only as means of discovering their food, but also as useful
agents in self-preservation, renders their senses of seeing and
hearing amazingly acute, and capable of furnishing a degree
of assistance quite unknown to the inhabitants of quiet and
civilized countries.  In situations where the eye is unavailable,
it is wonderful with what certainty and readiness the ear directs
to an object; and again where distance renders sound inaudible,
the eye often operates with a precision and force which a
person who has never witnessed the like would scarcely be
disposed to credit.   By the latter alone, they will often discern
with distinctness what others require a telescope to distinguish,
and discover the nature and appearances of particular objects,
when persons less versed in observation would scarcely be
 able to perceive the figures themselves.

                    place  on Friday night, Jan. 7th, 1831. The
aurora commenced with the evening, and was very distinctly
seen at about half-past five o'clock, exhibiting an arch of faint
yellowish light, bordering a dense black area, which was
bounded by the arch and the northern horizon.         The aurora
became more brilliant as the evening advanced and got darker,
darting occasional faint flashes of light upwards from the bright
and comparatively steady luminous curve.          About half-past

128   Mr. W.         Sturgeon's    Account          of an Aurora Borealis
 These two arches of light were frequently, after this time, very
badly defined, ever varying in breadth, and softening gradually
 into shade, particularly at their convex edges, by the lambent
 streamers which
                        #. played into the partially illuminated
expanse above. These soft gliding streams seemed in conti
nual play between the bright arches, flashing from the convex
edge of the lower or innermost, and sometimes blending the
two curves into one confused light, but never to that extent
as to obliterate the distinction of the two luminous arches,
which the eye could always trace by the superior refulgence
of their light. Between nine and ten o'clock the altitude of
the superior arch advanced from 20° to about 24°, but never
ascended higher than that point. The inner, or inferior, arch
advanced at the same time, and apparently in the same pro
portion, so that the same distance (about 10°) between the
two curves of strongest light, was nearly, perhaps exactly, pre
served during the whole time. The extremities of these arches
never completely reached the horizon, but were gradually lost
in a dark gloom, resembling an exceedingly dense fog,                                           al
though the atmosphere in every other part was perfectly clear.
This appearance was particularly remarked on the eastern
limbs, which were lost at various altitudes.       The western
limbs of the bright curves could not be so distinctly traced at
the place where these observations were made, on account of
their mixing with the reflected light in the atmosphere, of the
burning gas in London, which, at Woolwich, is always seen,
in the night, as a bright cloud hovering over the metropolis.
    About nine o'clock        I
                           called on Mr. Barlow, to inform him
of the aurora. . Mr. B., however, had seen it                       ofall

 before ten, an immense faint stream of light kindled in the
 eastern extremity of the external bow, and flashed directly
 between the two large stars in the tail of Ursa Major, and in
  one moment described an arch of 100°.                    This streamer was
  not undulatory, but advanced            gradually     and steadily, leaving
  the whole of     its track, for about         minute,         steady glow

  entirely lost.     About this time faint undulatory streams                                of
  light sprang from various parts                     of

                                      wavering      light were seen glowing
in    the black area near the horizon. These latter displays,
 however, were not frequent, but                     on

however was not            long duration, but the interval gave time
                            of

to   the whole display         the aurora borealis. The atmosphere
                                 of

and    glory.    On   turning    towards the      south,   the spectacle pre
sented   to  the eye was truly grand and imposing, and formed                               a
most beautiful and striking contrast with the phaenomena dis
playing        the north. Taurus had passed the meridian, pre
ceded
        of byin

throne         night; refulgent Sirius blazed                  in

    About half-past ten the eastern limb of the aurora again shot
forth immensely broad streaks of light, with intervening dense
shades. These streamers soon expanded, and mixing with each
other presented a steady uniform field of light. Other similar
 streamers darted upwards from the western limb, and expand
 ing like the former heightened the illumination, which now
 extended to nearly half the concave of the heavens. The light
 vanished gradually, and was succeeded by faint streamers of
 much less magnitude. The dark space below the inner arch
 was now, for a short time, well defined by the bright glow
 round  itsupper edge; but     soon became confused and irregu

                                 its

 dense central darkness now suddenly disappeared, and bright                       a
light illuminated the northern horizon, for the first time since
 the setting    of the sun.        dark broad streak soon stretched

The centre of the dark nucleus, however, was, from first to
last, west of the north, and very near to the magnetic meridian.
   From twelve o’clock nothing occurred worthy of remark:
the splendour of the aurora gradually declined, and at two on
Saturday morning it had totally vanished.
   I observed, during the whole of the night, that the streamers,
besides the vertical direction in which they generally shot,
had also a horizontal motion from east to west; so that in what
ever part of the aurora a streamer was kindled, it travelled
slowly towards the west, or towards the left hand of a spec
tator facing the north. It frequently happened that several
were lighted up in rapid succession, each of which was always
west of the preceding one.      A meteoric star, which traversed
the aurora about ten o'clock, also fell sloping in the same
direction.                                  -

visible.  I saw it about ten o'clock. It exhibited no corusca
tions, nor any flashes whatever. The only display was a broad
arch of light, bordering the upper edge of a black area of the
heavens in the north, and similarly situated to that which ap
peared the preceding night.  At eleven o'clock no trace of the
aurora was to be seen.

by such a scale, the highest peaks of the Himalah appear utterly
insignificant, and the greatest disturbances which have affected the
surface of our planet seem too small and trifling to produce any
appreciable effect upon the great mass of the interior of the earth.
   Figures of this nature, as the author observes, give more correct

Dec. 16.-       A PAPER was read, entitled, Researches in Physical
                   Astronomy; by John William Lubbock, Esq. W.P.
and Treasurer of the Royal Society.
    The author has shown in a former paper, published in the last
part of the Philosophical Transactions for 1830, that the stability
of a system of bodies subject to the law of gravitation, is always
preserved, provided they move in a space absolutely devoid of re
sistance.    This conclusion results from the analytical expressions
for the variations of the elliptic constants in the theory of the
Planetary Motions.
    In the present paper he extends his researches to the problem of
the precession of the Equinoxes, which admits of a similar solution
to the former.      Of the six constants which determine the position
of the   revolving  body, and the axis of instantaneous rotation, at any
instant, three have only periodic inequalities; while the other three
have each a term which varies as the time; but from the manner in
which these constants enter into the resulting expressions, the equi
librium of the system may be inferred to be stable, as in the former
 case. By the stability of the system, the author wishes to be un
 derstood to mean that the pole of the axis of rotation has always
 nearly the same geographical latitude, and that the angular velocity
 of rotation, and the obliquity of the ecliptic vary within small limits;
 and that   itsvariation    periodical.
                           is
     The author also gives new methods          obtaining the inequalities
                                                  of
 of  longitude, and the radius vector,       the planetary theory, retain
                                             in
 ing the square     of the eccentricities. When only the first powers
 of   the eccentricities are retained, these expressions admit         sim
                                                                         of
 plification.   He subjoins,       as  numerical example, the calcula

correspond             to the division           of the time between sun-rise                   nd sun-set
into twelve equal parts, which was their mode of computing time.
An example of these hour lines occurs in an ancient Greek sundial,
forming part of the Elgin collection of marbles at the British Mu
seum, and which there is reason to believe had been constructed
during the reign of the Antonines.          This dial contains the twelve
hour lines drawn on two vertical planes, which are inclined to each
other at an angle of 106°; the line bisecting that angle having
been in the meridian.         The hour lines actually traced on the dial
consist of such      portions  only as were requisite for the purpose the
dial was intended to serve: and these portions are sensibly straight
lines. But the author has shown, in a paper published in the Trans
actions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, that if these lines are
continued through the whole zone of the rising and setting semidi
urnal arcs, they will be found to be curves of double curvature on
the sphere. In the present paper the author enters into an inves
tigation of the course of these curves ; first selecting as an example
the lines indicating the 3rd and the 9th hours of the ancients.
These lines are formed by the points of bisection of                 the rising           all
and   setting   semidiurnal   arcs;  commencing    from the southern point
where the meridian cuts the horizon, and proceeding till the line
reaches       to

                            the always apparent parallels, which being                                      a

   Transylvania is described as being chiefly occupied by a high tertiary
basin, surrounded by four chains of mountains, viz.: 1. On the south
by the primary range of Wallachia or Taganrasch.          2. On the west
by another primary range, usually omitted by geographers; and
connected with a high calcareous chain near Kronstedt, and a ridge
of Carpathian sandstone near the pass Oytosch. 3. By the trachytic
hills separating the low tertiary and saliferous districts from the great
valley of the Secklerland.    4. By a large group of conical porphyritic
hills, with metalliferous summits, ranging by Korosch Banya, Zala
thria, Vorospatak, &c. Many of these hills are stated to average
from 3000 to 4000 feet in height, and the highest peaks to exceed
6000 feet. The author, describing the course of the rivers, remarks
that the hydrographical features are inaccurately given in          maps,                            all
and that most         the streams cut through the above chains
                        of                                                                                   by
gorges    ofvery recent fracture.    The primary rocks,      says, consist                 he
of  gneiss and slate; and that     the latter, serpentine, granular lime
                                                in

contact with the slate. The Carpathian sandstone with Fucoids
(Vienna sandstone)      mentioned is  occurring   the N.E. and S.E.

  limestone, equivalent to the highest tertiary limestone of Austria and
   Hungary. Fichtel is quoted as the earliest and best geological writer
  upon Transylvania, particularly as to the localities of shelly deposits
  and salt springs; and it is stated that from his work alone M. Beudant
  was enabled to compile a map of this country.
      For an account of the eastern chain of trachytes the author refers
  to what he has already written in Dr. Daubeny's work on Volcanos:
 —he inclines to the supposition that the scoriaceous trachytic porphy
 ries were erupted during the cretaceous or perhaps even during the old
 tertiary period; and he dissents from M. Beudant as to the possibility
 of drawing any distinct line of demarcation between the trachyte and
 porphyry in those places where these rocks are contiguous, although
 when at great distances from each other he allows the dissimilarity
 of their respective characters. A stratified, pumiceous and trachytic
 conglomerate, it is stated, frequently overlies the salt in Transylvania,
 and contains impressions of dicotyledonous plants, leaves, and fishes.
 The extinct craters of St. Annalake and the solfatarra still burning in
 the trachyte of Budoskegy, and the many acidulated and mineral
 springs, are considered by the author clearly to indicate the recent age
 of some of the volcanic phaenomena in this country, to the principal en
 trance of which, the Romans assigned the name of “Vulcan's Pass.”

 influence Geological Phaenomena; by        J. F.W. Herschel, Esq. F.R.S.

      The author states his object in this paper to be, an inquiry into
 the possible geological influence of slow periodical changes in the
 orbits of the earth and moon, such as have been demonstrated by
 geometers to take place in consequence of planetary and solar per
 turbation. Such influence he regards as extending only to the pro
 duction of changes in the amount of the tides and their consequent
 erosive action on our continents, and of periodical fluctuations in
 the quantity of solar heat received by the earth, every such fluc
 tuation being of course accompanied with a corresponding altera
 tion of climates; and therefore, if sufficiently extensive and con
 tinued, giving room for a variation in the animal and vegetable
 productions of the same region at different and widely remote
 epochs.
     The subject of the tides is first considered. Since any approach
 of the moon to the earth produces an increase of the lunar tide in
the triplicate ratio of such approach,     it follows that any diminution
 of the moon's mean distance must produce          an increase in the ave
rage     tide during the whole period that such approach          subsists.
The mean distance of the moon is actually on the decrease, and has
been so for ages past, producing the astronomical phaenomenon
of her secular acceleration. The mean amount of the tides, there
fore, has long been, and will long continue to be, on the increase
from this cause, but the effect of it is shown to be confined to such
moderate limits as to be of no geological importance.
     The author next considers the possible effect of an increase in
the excentricity of the lunar orbit, which would affect not the ave
                                                                      rage

 rage but the extreme rise and fall of the tides.        Such an increase,
however, he regards as necessarily limited, so as to be incapable of
 producing such an enormous increase of tides as would account for
 any of the greater diluvial phaenomena, though possibly cases of
great local devastation in estuaries and confined channels would
arise, and the outlines of the continents, in particular parts of their
coasts, might be materially modified by such increased occasional
action. No change in the earth's orbit within the limits of possibility
 would produce any material change in the solar tides.
   He next considers the effect of planetary perturbation on the
earth's orbit, and, dismissing the variation of the obliquity of
the ecliptic, which is known to be confined within very narrow
limits, he regards the excentricity as the only element whose
variation can possibly have any effect of the kind in view ;
and that by affecting, first, the mean, and secondly, the extreme
quantities of solar heat received by the earth in            annual revolu                     its

series of observations upon this star, and at 11 hours found it of
the fifth magnitude, and equal to s and & Lyrae.     Supposing the
period to be that assigned by Mr. Goodricke, eight revolutions
would have been performed in fifty-one days exactly; but when
viewed by Mr.                 Birt on the 12th of July, at 10 o'clock, it was about
3.4 magnitude,                 and less than y Lyrae; while on the 13th it was
decidedly of the fourth magnitude, and on the 14th of the third, or
as bright as y. Mr. Birt therefore concluded that it came to                                                                    its

   We find well-recorded cases where small alterations of elevation
have produced very sensible effects upon the air, sometimes                                                                    in
creasing and sometimes diminishing             temperature; and, again,      its
at  other times, we find the temperature          the air nearly the same       of
through very considerable altitudes. (See Wells, Humboldt, &c.)

termediate portion of 1075 feet, and draws the
variation of refraction arising from any conceivable derangement in
this middle portion will be inconsiderable, compared with that which
 may be produced by changes in the lowest portion.

    that of extreme dryness; but this is an exception to intertropical
    regions in general.    In Guiana and La Plata, for instance, and in
    Ceylon, the thick woods exhale a considerable degree of moisture,
    far exceeding that of our own country; the mean dew point of the
    atmosphere of London being 44°.5, while that of intertropical regions
    is from 70° to 75°. Animals from such climates, it is suggested,
    require a moist atmosphere, and this may readily be produced by
    watering the flues used for heating the houses in which they are
    kept. Analogous to this is the advantage obtained in the cultiva
    tion of stove plants by keeping the houses well watered.         The
    neglect of supplying to the air a sufficient quantity of simple and
    innoxious moisture is attended with two evils. Not only are the
    animals kept in an atmosphere too dry for their healthy preserva
    tion; but the dry air, greedily absorbing moisture, becomes impreg
    nated with the excreted fluids of the animals in confinement; and
    thus the secreting   surfaces of the lungs are at once exposed to a
    constant stimulus from increased and rapid exhalation, and to the
    additional stimulus inflicted by the continual breathing of air loaded
    with saline and irritating particles.   In well constructed houses it
    is of the first importance that the fluids of the animals should be
    conducted from the buildings. Ventilation should also be perfect
    not only through the body of the building, but through each indivi
    dual cage or den. This is doubly necessary where the air is viti
    ated, not only by the animals themselves, but by numerous visitors.
    For the general regulation of the admission of cold air a convenient
    plan is to have a leaden or iron weight balanced in a vessel of mer
    cury, attached to a sliding sash, which will thus rise or fall in
    proportion to the height of the mercury. Mr. Cox regards it as of
    no importance, as to the effect produced on the atmosphere, by
    what means an increased temperature is preserved, whether by flues
    or steam or hot water, if the degree obtained be the same : the
    only reason for preferring one to another is the greater facility it
    may afford of keeping up an equable temperature.

                           a

    himself on this occasion to the description of the organs connected
    with digestion.    The salivary organs and those of deglutition were
    treated of in detail: the former parts, which are remarkably deve
    loped in    all

are quite distinct from the parotid, and are each about the size

    Between the membrane of the palate and the bone, in the narrow

immediately exterior to the membrane of the fauces.

bony palate as far as the circular aperture of the posterior nares.
The sides of the soft palate are continuous with the tongue, and,
becoming gradually contracted, form <U+017F>auces of a funnel shape, the
posterior aperture of which just admits a black-lead pencil of the
usual size for drawing. The membrane covering the posterior part
of the dorsum of the tongue is continued smoothly and uninter

   At the commencement of the colon there are two pouches of an
oval form, from the union of which the rest of the intestine proceeds
with very distinct sacculi. An analogous structure exists in the
cacum of the Guinea-pig, where however the two sacculi appear
rather to belong to the caecum, being partially separated from the
colon by a circular production of the lining membrane in a valvular
form.
  Jan. 11, 1831.-Sir Thomas Phillipps, Bart. in the Chair.
  An Address by Mr. J. V. Thompson “To the Members of the
Zoological Society, and the Zoologists of the United Kingdom in
general,” was read, soliciting such support, by subscription, as may
enable him to continue, without further loss, his “Zoological Re
searches and Illustrations.” This Address is printed, together with
a list of the subjects of some of the succeeding Memoirs, on the
cover of the Fourth Number of the Researches, which was at the
same time laid on the table.
   An Extract was read from a Letter addressed by Daniel Sharpe,
 Esq., to Mr. Bennett, in which the writer describes the luminous
appearance of the ocean as observed by him on several nights du
ring his passage to Lisbon. A considerable sparkling was visible in
the water close under the vessel's side, particularly in the spray
just thrown off from the bow, and also occasionally when a wave
broke : it gradually vanished as the water became quieter.       The
appearance was that of a number of small sparks not brighter than
the smallest stars. When a bucket full of the water was taken up,
nothing was visible until it was stirred or shaken, when it was in
stantly filled with spangles, which disappeared as the water settled:
the most elegant effect was when the waves or spray broke over the
deck, which then became covered with stars for a few minutes. Mr.
Sharpe states that he collected a great quantity in a glass, and exa
mined them carefully with a microscope the next morning, in the
expectation of observing minute Crustacea, &c., to which the ap
pearance he describes has frequently been attributed.      He could,
however, detect nothing but an abundance of small fibres and shreds
 of,
   apparently, animal matter, and did not find even one entire animal.
Hence     he  disposed

Dr. MacCulloch       has also attributed            it to the latter cause
                                                                     and     ;
states that every marine animal that he has examined is luminous.
Assuming the observations of M. Bory de St. Vincent and those of
Dr. MacCulloch to be equally correct in the instances which fell
under their notice, it is worthy of inquiry whether any, and what,
differences exist in the luminosity of the ocean, when it is occasioned
by marine animals, or when it is owing to other causes.
    Mr. Yarrell exhibited a female of the common game Fowl which
had assumed the plumage of a male.           The dull brown colour of
the breast was varied    by an intermixture of the jet black plumage
peculiar to the male      ; the feathers     of the neck and those on the sides
of the tail were long, slender, hackled and bright in colour;              all    the
tail feathers were more        less curved; and the spurs were half
                              or                                                   an

particularly noticed.  Its colour was a uniform green without any
markings.            It was
                  named and characterized as
  PLATycercus UNIcolor.       Plat. corpore viridi concolore; rostro
   basi plumbeo, apice nigro.
  Mr. Vigors also exhibited a specimen of the lineated Pheasant
of Dr. Latham [Gen. Hist., vol. viii. p. 201.             14.] which had                sp.

M      •
           AUBERT, colonel of artillery,         has made numerous experi
             ments on the above subject: he states that charcoal when
very finely powdered has the appearance of an unctuous liquid, and
occupies only one third the space of sticks of charcoal of about
six inches long.
    In this state of division, it absorbs air much more rapidly than
when it is in sticks; still however the absorption goes on slowly,
requiring several days for completion; it is accompanied with the
disengagement of heat, which is to be regarded as the true cause
of the spontaneous combustion of the charcoal; the heat is equal
to about 350° of Fahrenheit. The inflammation occurs towards the
centre of the mass, at about five or six inches beneath the surface;
the temperature is constantly higher in this place than in any other;
there must consequently exist towards the edges of the mass a de
scending current of air, which tends towards the centre, and be
becomes vertical, without penetrating towards the lower parts of
the mass, where the temperature is but little raised.                It is on this
account that a      portion  only   of the charcoal     appears  to produce    the
phaenomena; the remainder serves as an isolating substance, and
preserves the heat in the centre.
    The variations of the barometer, thermometer and hygrometer do
not appear to have any sensible influence upon the spontaneous                                          in
flammation of the charcoal; if such influence exists, the experi
ments have not been sufficiently multiplied to prove                                  it.

    INFLUENCE OF THE AURORA BOREALIS                                        ON       THE MAGNETIC

   Mr. Sturgeon has mentioned, in his paper on the Aurora Borealis
of Jan. 7th, as witnessed at Woolwich (p. 128 of our present Number),
that he could not observe the slightest change of direction or disturb
ance in the magnetic needle, during the display of the Aurora. As
this is a subject of much importance, we deem it improper to publish
this result, without stating, at the same time, that M. Arago, at the
Observatory of Paris, was also engaged on the evening of the 7th, in
observations on both the horizontal and the dipping-needle, during
the appearance of the Aurora; and that he found the former to be de
ranged 1° 6' 47" by the influence of that meteor, and the latter the
enormous quantity of 21", the ordinary diurnal variation of the dip, at
this season, scarcely exceeding        An account      M. Arago's ob

having a base or ground of white or gray colour, and apparently com
posed of decayed felspar, and very minute scales of mica or talc,
or both, in which are imbedded rounded pebbles of grayish-white
translucent quartz-rock. The quartz-pebbles are from the size of
a pea to that of a hen's egg. This conglomerated mass is here and
there alternated with or traversed by a white quartzy sand,
with scales of mica. The whole conglomerated mass is mixed up
with flints of various sizes and forms. The flints are yellow, brown,
and gray, more or less translucent, often enveloped in a white sili
ceous opaque crust, and containing organic remains principally of
sponges or alcyonia.       In some flints the centre is hollow, and the
walls of the  cavity  lined with calcedony.    One of the hillocks has
been  opened    to the depth of about fifteen or eighteen feet.    The
quartz-pebbles become more translucent the deeper the pit is open
ed; and the flints, which, at the surface of the ground, are generally
of a brown colour, exhibit other tints in the interior of the bed. The
hollows between the hillocks are destitute of pebbles and gravel,
and have a clayey bottom.        The direction of the hollows appears
in  general    to run east and west. These hollows may perhaps
have been    scooped    out, and the beds containing flints and peb

                                THE COMET.
Extracts     of    Communications from       Mr.         Herapath and        Sir   J.   South
       to the Editor of The Times, Jan. 25th, 28th, and 29th.
   On the 7th, at 6h30" A. M., it was in 264°11' right ascension, and
 12°33'south declination, from my observation. On the 9th, at 6'47"
A. M., it had 261° 59' right ascension, and 12° 1' south declination, by
the observation at Kensington Observatory; and on the 18th I found
it in 252° 18' right ascension, and 9° 2' south declination, at 5' 43"
A. M. The time was apparent or solar in each case. On the 7th the
head was white and brilliant, with a tail of between 19 and 2° at Cran
ford, and the comet equalled, as I conceived, stars of the second mag
nitude. To Sir James South, on the 9th, the head was very luminous,
and the tail about 1° long ; while to Mr.                J.
                                               T., near Liverpool, on the
 12th, the tail seemed 2°, or, as he informs me by letter, probably 3°
long, the head being bright and the nucleus well defined. On the
 18th the head appeared to me much less and more confused ; but the
tail had extended in length to full 3°, and was much more apparent.
At these several epochs it was about 25°, 29°, and 47° distant from
the sun.
   From     all
             these circumstances,     appears that the apparent motion

four rainbows, five aurorae boreales, and ten gales of wind, or days on which
they have prevailed, namely, two from the North-east, one from the East, two
from the South-east, two from the South, and three from the South-west.
   AURORAE BoreALEs.-In the evening of the 11th instant, a bright aurora
borealis appeared at half-past eight, between an opening in a black cloud
in the northern horizon. By 2 A.M. the cloud had dispersed, when the
aurora was again seen with increased brightness, and as a segment cut off
by the horizon, occupied a space of seventy degrees, from which emanated
several flame-coloured   perpendicular columns, some of which were two
degrees wide, and thirty degrees in altitude. In half an hour after, they
were succeeded by others, which ultimately exhibited red and purple tints,
with an inclination to the horizon. Many persons in the country saw the
aurora about this time, and described it as having a very awful appearance,
from a mixture of the colours.

from North-north-east to North-west. The altitude of its arch was about
eight degrees, and four meteors appeared over                             it.

THE   object

                       of this notice is to communicate a few facts
                       the volatility of oxalic acid. It is stated in
chemical works, that when this acid is exposed to the destruc
tive distillation, part escapes decomposition and is sublimed,
being deposited as a white sublimate in the neck of the retort;
but whether this appearance is owing to real volatility, or is an
instance of that spurious kind of sublimation, exemplified in
the ascent of boracic acid along with aqueous vapour, and in
the removal of fused chloride of silver when a current of hy
drogen gas is passing rather rapidly over             surface, does not  its

 instead of remaining pulverulent, becomes covered with nu
 merous minute acicular crystals, and an acrid vapour rises,
which condenses on cold surfaces in the form of needles. This
 vapour is accompanied with a small quantity of moisture, which
 completes the two equivalents of water required to be with
 drawn, in order to constitute the sublimed acid.
    The sublimation of oxalic acid at 212°, though sufficient
both to occasion loss in analysis, and to establish the fact of
volatility, is too slow for affording a supply of the sublimed
acid.     A convenient process for this purpose is the following:
 About half an ounce or an ounce of oxalic acid, purified by
repeated crystallization, is dried in a rather deep evaporating
basin, exposed on the sand-bath to a temperature of about 350°
or 400°Fahr.: as soon as sublimation commences, the vessel
should be covered with a layer of smooth filtering paper, on
which is laid a fold of common blotting-paper, and both are
pressed tight upon the edge of the basin by means of another
and somewhat larger capsule, placed with                           its
                                                        convexity down

                            the acid       decomposed, and the water

  The facts already mentioned leave little doubt of sublimed
oxalic acid consisting of 36 parts or one equivalent of the
anhydrous acid, and 9 parts or an equivalent of water. The
correctness of this opinion was proved by analysis, the oxalic
acid being precipitated with lime, and                        its

   Before concluding this notice,       may add few remarks
                                             I                      a                        on
the solubility   ordinary oxalic acid
                  of                        water, concerning which
                                                   in
the statements    of of
                   different authors are very discordant.           The
solvent  power    water increases    rapidly   with the  temperature.
A   hot solution       of
                      oxalic acid was                   set
                                               aside for twenty-four
hours, when the clear liquid, kept          the temperature
                                                   at                50°            of
Fahr., was decanted from the crystals which had been de
posited.   This solution consisted         one part
                                                  of       crystallized   of
acid and about 15:5            of
                           water. The     experiment     was repeated
  byputting the pulverized crystals into water          50°, agitating   at
repeatedly during twenty-four hours, and then decanting the
solution from the undissolved acid.            The ratio        the ingre     of
dients was almost      exactly   the same              as

      MONG       the numerous defects and diseases to which the
       component parts of the eye are subject, accidental cir
 cumstances have led me to investigate several, which appear
 to have their seat in the humours; and which, as far as I can
 learn by inquiries among medical men, are not very accurately
 understood.       That disorder of vision, to which I shall chiefly

 166     Mr. Batchelor's   Observations on a Species      of Musca:
  confine my attention in the following paper, is a species of
 musca volitans apparently floating in the aqueous humour;
 which, excepting a slight notice by Mr. Ware (Medico
  Chirurgical Transactions, vol. v.), has been wholly overlooked,
 or referred to other sources, by writers who have devoted
 themselves to this branch of medicine.           Mr. Ware describes
 them as consisting of “a number of intersecting motes or
 beams, floating before the eyes.          Sometimes they appeared
 nearly spherical, sometimes little long knotted lines, varying
 in number, size, and opacity.”         This description is most ap
 plicable when the observer looks towards a bright cloud, or
 gleam of sunshine through a window, immediately after waking
 in a morning. Where the light is more feeble they give the
 idea of dusky spots floating before the eye.          Mr. Wardrop,
 in his work on the Morbid        Anatomy    of the Eye, speaking of
 floating muscae, goes so far as to say, that         “ifthey are pro
 duced    by any spot   or  opacity  in the  transparent   humours of
 the eye, it must be in the posterior part of the vitreous hu
mour; because experiments, and the principles of optics, prove
that no opacity of the aqueous, crystalline, or anterior part of
 the vitreous humour can throw a partial shadow on the re
tina.” The opacities of the retina are those only which
 Mr. Wardrop has taken into consideration.
     I have tried various means of illuminating the interior of
the eye, in order to be enabled to examine these specks to the
greatest advantage. They may be seen by looking through
any small lens at a candle, but the optical reasons alluded to
by Mr. Wardrop, render it advisable to use the smallest lens
which can be procured; and the light thus entering by a very
minute point, is obviously more likely to admit of a shadow
being cast upon the retina by a small object between it and
that membrane.        By looking through a small hole in a plate
of   tin,I  have also clearly seen a stratum of still smaller par
ticles than those which appear as specks, and interfere (in a
trifling degree) with vision, under ordinary circumstances.
    Examining them by the above methods, these muscae are
found not to be opaque spots, but pellucid globules, and,
as nearly as  I  can judge of their seat, floating in the aqueous
humour.      Though   frequently suspended for a short time, they
seem to possess greater gravity than the medium in which they
exist, and when the eye is at rest sink below the line of vision.
From this situation they can readily be projected upwards by
a rapid motion of the globe of the eye in a vertical direction;
and the best time    for observing them    is   as they fall gradually
to  the lower  partof   the  eye,  passing  across the field  ofvision.
They are then seen distinctly       to   consist     of
                                                     globules, either
                                                             detached,

detached, arranged in lines, or mingled irregularly together,
The insulated specks exhibit a bright spot in the centre,
(I have sometimes however seen it dark,) surrounded by a
dark circle. They are, in fact, small lenses capable of con
verging the rays which fall upon them to a minute focal point;
and the dark ring surrounding the central point is the sha
dow of the circumference of the globule, from which the rays
of light have been directed to pass through the centre. In a
very bright light, no less than four dark circles may be seen,
the outer narrower and better defined than the inner ones. In
the lines or strings of globules, the dark shadow is also seen, but
under a different form, a double line of shade passing along
each side of the chain; these lines appear to be indented at
intervals, but not very clearly, as if the globules had been
compressed by adhering to each other.                On the slightest
movement of the eye-ball they change their position, and are
frequently lost sight             of,
                              but without any uniformity            direc             of

globules, are perfectly unconnected one with another.

below the centre             of
                          the eye, though they may              projected        be

                                         is

                                              descend may         proved              be

 XXX.           On   Mr. Witchell's                 Method                of    clearing        a Lunar       Di
                              stance.       By C. RUMKER, Esq.”
I HAVE         remarked that a very imperfect approximate fo–
    reign method for clearing the lunar distance (under some cir
cumstances liable to considerable errors) is now much in vogue
amongst British mariners, although they have better methods
of their own: amongst which Witchell's appears to me one of
the best.    I think approximate methods better calculated for
mariners than direct ones, since small errors are more likely to
vitiate the result and more easily escape discovery than in the
former, where the computer after a little practice can nearly
judge from the altitudes and distance what each correction
 will amount to: and Witchell's enables him morever to assign
to himself by a rough sketch the reasons for his proceedings.
But    as analytical demonstrations  are now more approved,                                                    I
offer you the following one of his formula, preceded by a simpler
practical rule than the one usually given.

    I believe Icorrectly follow Mr. Daniell” in estimating the
evaporation “from water, vegetation, or ploughed land” as
equal; although this does not coincide with Mr. Dalton's ob
servations on the same subject +.
   It has been already remarked, that the computed quantity
exceeds that actually delivered; and if we consider the differ
ence to be one-seventh of the whole, there will still be an ex
cess of 104,407,894-15 cubic feett; nor will our conclusions be
much falsified, by omitting the quantity afforded by wells,
which probably does not much exceed 10,000 cubic feet per
month.    Whence then this excess 2
  Mr. Fox (whose kindness to me in innumerable instances
has exceeded that of a parent) has in several cases detected
muriate of soda in water from some of the mines situated se
veral miles from the sea, and thence remarks:        may be                   “It                in
ferred from such facts as these, that the sea-water must in some
places penetrate into the fissures of the earth, and conse
quently may in a greater or less degree assistin supplying the
loss of moisture carried off by evaporation $,” &c. The slate
strata of Cornwall are usually considerably inclined, and the
veins by which they are traversed being unconformable to the
stratification, they must receive much of the water which per
colates through the strata.

   t Mr. Dalton's experiments on the evaporation from mould and vegeta
tive surfaces, to which I have already referred, are the only ones on these
points which I have seen described in detail. . If we follow the numbers
there given by this illustrious philosopher, it will give a different value to
the 8th and 10th columns of Table III. thus:

that they seem to need repetition.

the cross veins, which have a direction of about north and
south, are in many cases supposed to traverse the Cornish
peninsula from sea to sea, and although sometimes, are not
frequently, dislocated, and consequently may be the medium
through which sea-water may enter the mines. There are
some mines in which the water stands at the adit, (North
Downs and Huel Busy,) which intervene between those in
which the muriate of soda was detected and the sea; but as
the latter are by far the deeper, it may be readily admitted
that the percolation may have taken place at or near the lowest
levels.    But it has not yet been shown that sea-salt does not
exist in the water of North Downs and Huel Busy; and until
a long continued series of observations shall show         absence,                       its

XXXII.     On the Calculation of the Orbits of Double Stars.
                     By Professor ENCKE”.
   T was the immortal Herschel who, among his many grand
    views, first directed the attention of astronomers to the
highly remarkable phaenomenon that so many stars are placed
closely together, and to the conclusion which he drew from
this circumstance, that there is great probability that two such
stars, separable only by highly magnifying telescopes, are not
only apparently near each other, owing to the place whence
they are viewed, but that they really form in space a coordinate
system; that they act upon one another, and in consequence
undergo changes in their relative positions, which, after longer
or shorter intervals, may be capable of observation, and whose
laws may be developed in the course of time; and from that
                 i.
moment a new field has been opened for practical astronomy,
the extent of which it is not yet possible to determine. Herschel
was not satisfied with merely advancing this hypothesis, but
he, in the beginning of his career, thoroughly examined the
heavens, and                 a number of observations on the rela
tive positions    of stars thus placed closely together, in order to
transmit to future times safe points of comparison; and he en
joyed the satisfaction of learning, that on a new examination,
 after a lapse of more than twenty years, such sensible changes
were observed, in several double stars, as left no doubt re
flºg       the truth of his hypothesis. After him, Struve of Dorpat
   rst resumed these investigations, confirmed the observations
of Herschel, and after a due appreciation of his wonderful
 zeal, and the eminent skill evinced by him in the management
 of inferior means, he obtained, in the great refractor of
Frauenhofer, one of the most powerful instruments for accu
rately investigating this subject. Herschel (the son), and South,
had in the mean time likewise devoted their eminent talents
to the observation of double stars; and since the new cata
logue of Struve has proved the vast number of such systems;
since the comparison of the observations made with different
instruments, and after different methods, promises a by far
  reater degree of accuracy than was formerly expected; since,
 astly, practical optics, in England, France, and Germany
have, with regard to the size of instruments and the distinct
ness of images, reached a perfection hitherto deemed unattain
able, the observations of double stars have obtained much
                            -
additional interest.

Four observations are still more than sufficient. In a similar
manner however, to the determination of the orbit of a comet,
the superfluous datum of the four observations may be made
use of for obtaining, in conjunction with another, a datum which
is more suitable to the calculation, or it may be employed for
any other particular purpose, and for facilitating the develop
ment.      If the time were not to be taken into consideration at
all, it would be necessary, the ellipse having five constants in
its  most general equation,           have five distances, with their

sometimes from the circle of declination, sometimes from the
parallel of the star at rest. , Let the angles reckoned from any

AN      article      the Bulletin des Sciences Mathematiques for
                            in
      August 1830, demands some observations from me.
   We may begin with stating,            what Clairaut's theory
                                                                                                                 a of

the equilibrium                  of
                           homogeneous fluid consists. This
                                      a                                                                         is
point not      any respect doubtful.
                   in                    According      the inventor                 to
of the  theory   and      other      all
                                authors,  two conditions are neces
sary and sufficient for the equilibrium.       Supposing the equi
librium   possible,      gives  only
                                  it one  equation  for determining
the figure          of
                the fluid.   No accelerating forces are taken into

account except those in action at the outer surface; and it is
implied that the like forces, expressed by the same functions
of the coordinates, and no others but these, act upon every
interior particle of the mass.   It follows from this view of the
matter that the level surfaces depend entirely on the outer
surface, and attempts are made to demonstrate this.-Vide

   On the other hand      contend that the figure
                                           I              the fluid                                  of
will depend   upon  the forces that actually urge every particle
to  move from      place: that,
                           its          homogeneous planet   in   a                                              in      a
fluid state, there are forces prevailing        the interior parts,             in
which Clairaut has     neglected:    and that the equilibrium                                                        is
impossible, unless such      figure      the fluid can
                                                    a      found  of                                 be                  as
will set free the interior particles  from those   irregular forces.
For this purpose the true figure         equilibrium must possess of
a property not deducible from Clairaut's theory; and this new
condition, although   relates only      particular problem,
                                                                                                                     of or

of  the stratum between the two surfaces upon the particles
within the lower surface.      Such an attraction therefore can
have no   place in the theory of Clairaut, which notices no forces
except those in action at the outer surface.       It is implied in
the  theory  that the only forces  urging  a particle,  whether                                             si
tuated in the surface or in the interior parts of the fluid, are
the centrifugal force and the attraction of the whole mass;
these forces produce the pressures of the canals a A and b B;
but they have no connection with the pressure 8, which has
quite a different origin. The theory of Clairaut is therefore.
insufficient for determining the equilibrium, because it leaves
out some of the causes tending to change the figure of the
fluid.
   Further,         I
              shall prove that the equation found by M. Pois
son leads to two independent conditions for the figure of
equilibrium. These conditions are, first, the equation of the
outer surface, which is                  all
                           that Clairaut's theory requires; se
condly, the equality                of   pressure        at   all   the points             of   every       in
terior surface,           as              similar and similarly posited

outer surface.  For we    may   suppose  that one end          the                              a
canal     remains fixed, while the other end

that the whole matter above any level surface must act upon
the fluid below               by

   The embarrassment attending the application               Clairaut's                    of

                                                            to

  Having thus                 seen that the most elementary phaenomena                                of
geology               involve the existence of such currents,
                necessarily
and that therefore they must be by the same necessity ad
mitted in every theory whatever which pretends to account for
these phaenomena; let us (as in the former part) proceed to
examine the case more in the detail.
  I. The    conglomerate rocks and strata of gravel interposed
in several of our geological formations indicate several periods
of violent diluvial action, of which the last was more recent
than the deposition of                   of all
                               our regular strata, and appears

form the precise limit        demarcation between the epochs
the geological formations and the actual epoch; and              every                      in

192      Rev.W. D. Conybeare                 on the Phaenomena       of Geology
spread abroad by oceanic waves, like the gravel now lining
the beaches of our coasts: for it is clear that river courses
can only convey gravel over the lines of their channels, or
over the flats exposed to their floods. When therefore we find
gravel uniformly distributed over extensive plains which we
cannot conceive to have been in such a predicament,           see not          I
how we can avoid     having   recourse to oceanic    waves;   indeed,
comparing the level of these beds with those of the posterior
rocks of submarine formation, (so far as the subsequent disloca
tions and disturbances which have much deranged the relative
position of these strata will allow us to make the observation,)
we very generally find these masses of gravel deposited be
neath what appears to have been the sea level at the epoch of
their accumulation.      It certainly may be said, on the part of
the Fluvialists, that although the distribution of these gravel
beds must be referred to oceanic waves, still they may have
originated in the action of the rivers traversing the then
existing continents, and have been by these rivers transported
to the bed of that ocean. That this may have been partially
the case         is,
             indeed, true; just              as

versally distributed: and this they must have done, though we
 do  not find from the earliest records preserved                 the topo     of
graphy     of the   country,    that  they  are     the habitin    changing       of
their course          in
                     the least.     Secondly, they must have washed
away every projecting mass                     of
                                          the chalk formation, although

                        in

they must have carried blocks                  many tonsof       weight for   in
some hundred miles, though they have now unaccountably
left off transporting any thing                   of

ported these blocks               up
                              their currents; since the granite            de             is

In the   men, a portion of skin, usually either of a jackal or of
 a wild cat, is suspended in front of the body from a leathern
5.       which encircles the loins, and frequently a portion of
   ried leather hangs from the same behind to conceal at least
 a portion of the after parts, when the principal article of
 covering is too short to perform that office. Amongst the
 women again, the article in question is more extensive, and
 commonly consists of some ragged skins or pieces of leather,
 variously fixed together and attached round the loins, thereby
 enveloping more or less the whole of the parts between those
 and the middle of the thighs.            The members of this sex also

 their heads, which they usually compose of the same article as
 that which forms the other parts of their dress; and if obtain

200          Mr. D. Gilbert's               Statement respecting the
own construction,-such as sashes formed of circular pieces
of the shell of the ostrich egg, pieces of wood, teeth of wild
animals, shells, young tortoises, &c. and those they display
in different positions and forms, according to the fancies of
the wearers.
    The circumstance of their having no fixed abodes goes to
prevent them from having any established huts; and the con
stant necessity of moving from one place to another in quest
of an uncertain and scanty subsistence, inclines them to bestow
little care or labour on their temporary dwellings.         They
either erect a shelter of bushes for the  night, under the shade
of which they repose, or dig a hole in the ground, into which
they creep, or else seek a refuge in some natural crevice of a
rock, or under a projecting stone, either of which they consider
as quite sufficient for a transient residence.   Though such is
the general method they follow, in protecting themselves
against the effects of the weather during the periods of their
repose, yet some are more particular, and extend their consi
deration so far as to supply themselves with a sort of mat, which
they place nearly upright by means of a couple of poles, viz.
one at each extremity, and under the protection of that they
seek their rest.                                                 -

ance, and of placing the whole transaction above even the
suspicion of favouritism or partiality, the late President was
induced to request the aid of two individuals, as highly distin
guished by their abilities and by their learning as by the emi
nent stations which they hold in the hierarchy of the country,
where able and intrepid champions have never been wanting
to vindicate the natural and moral attributes of the Divinity
against the equally dangerous attacks of infidelity, fanaticism,
and imposture.     The two distinguished prelates, the Arch
bishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London, most readily
 condescended to afford their assistance; and after much de
liberation, and with the concurrence of the Noble Lord above
alluded to, the work has been placed in the hands of the fol
lowing eight gentlemen —
   The Rev. William Whewell, M.A. F.R.S., Fellow of                                     Tri
nity College, and Professor of Mineralogy in the University
of Cambridge.

 Edinburgh.

cine in the University of Oxford.

Church, and Professor of Geology in the University of Ox
ford.

   Charles Bell, Esq. F.R.S., Surgeon.
   The Rev. William Kirby, M.A. F.R.S.
   William Prout, Esq. M.D. F.R.S.
Each being pledged to take a part, as designated by the
testator, most adapted to his acquirements and to his pursuits:
and thus it is confidently hoped and expected, that a work
entrusted to such individuals will appear, as a whole, worthy
of the age and of the country about to give it birth.

 They form, perhaps, in a scientific point of view (with the exception
 of the Life of Galileo and that of Kepler, each of which must be re
garded as being, on the whole, of equal importance to them) the
most valuable single part of the works published by the Society for
 the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and the precursor, we hope, of
many more, characterized by similar excellence.
    The projection according to which these maps are laid down, is
that which was suggested, for representing the sphere of the heavens,
by Mr. Lubbock, (under whose immediate direction, we understand,
they have been executed,) in his paper on the perspective represen
tation of a circle, published in our fifth volume, of the present series.

appear to have been the only authorities employed in laying down
those objects.   But in the Philosophical Transactions for 1828 is a
catalogue of 629 nebulae and clusters of stars in the southern hemi
sphere, observed at Paramatta by Mr. Dunlop, no use of which ap
pears to have been made in the construction of these maps.
   Lacaille, we believe, observed only about 40 or 50 nebulae and
clusters of stars in the southern hemisphere; 26 of which, besides
the Nebula Major and Nebula Minor, are given.        Now although a
large number of those described by Mr. Dunlop may be too small,
(like the remainder of Lacaille's,) to be laid down in the present
series of maps, and may require to be reserved for that which, as we
have mentioned, is now in preparation, yet it seems probable that
out of nearly 600 nebulae and clusters observed solely by Mr. Dunlop,
some must be equal in apparent magnitude to the 26 of Lacaille's
which have actually been inserted, and must therefore require inser
tion in the present series equally with them.
   The “Planetary Nebulae" discovered by Struve, of which it is re
marked in the “Explanation” that “they deserve to be reckoned
amongst the most interesting objects in the heavens,” have with
great propriety been inserted; and No. 8 of Struve is the only one
of them which appears in the maps representing the southern hemi
sphere.     Now Nos. 266 and 267 of Dunlop probably belong to this
interesting class of bodies, especially the latter.
   Annexed to Mr. Dunlop's Catalogue are two elaborate plates, very
correctly laid down from observations, of the Nebula Major and Ne
bula Minor, no use of which seems to have been made in representing
those nebulae in the maps. In Mr. Dunlop's plates their forms appear
to differ considerably from those given in the maps; and the places
assigned to them by Mr. Dunlop, differ from those given by Lacaille.
In laying down the Milky-way, Mr. Dunlop's detailed map of            from        it,
the Robur Caroli       Scorpio, does not appear
                        to

    A  further discussion is entered into in order to prove that the pres
sures propagated from the surfaces into the interior parts balance and
destroy one another, which completely establishes the permanence of
the figure of the fluid.          It is also shown that the mass of fluid, under
these circumstances, has no tendency to turn upon an axis.
    To illustrate the foregoing problem, the author applies it to the de
termination of the figure of equilibrium of a homogeneous mass of
fluid entirely at liberty, of which the particles attract one another with
a force directly proportional to the distance, at the same time that
they are urged by a centrifugal force caused by rotation about an
axiS.
     He then enters upon the investigation of the second problem, in
which the law of attraction of the particles is that of the inverse du
plicate ratio of the distance; and finally arrives at the conclusion,
                                                                              is,

   The subject treated of in this paper is introduced by a review of the
labours of Clairaut, Euler, D'Alembert, and Thomas Simpson.                 The
theories of these eminent men, the author remarks, were very defici

very closely set and directed downwards so completely cover the                                   in
ferior surface of the expanded membranes, improperly called suckers,
with which the terminal joint of the tarsi is provided, that it cannot
possibly be brought into contact with the objects on which these                                  in

the insects traverse the vertical sides of smooth bodies, by means
strictly mechanical, as Dr. Hooke had suggested.

    Jan.5, 1831.—A paper was read entitled, “On the general struc
ture of the Lake Mountains of the North of England, and on the
great dislocations by which they have been separated from the
neighbouring chains;” by Prof. Sedgwick, Pres. G.S.
   The country, of which the author hopes to give a detailed descrip
tion in a series of communications, is bounded to the west and the
south by the waters of the Irish Sea and Morecambe Bay. Towards
the north it descends into the plain of the new red sandstone within
the basin of the Eden; and on the east side it presses against, and
partly encroaches on, the central carboniferous chain of the north.
Within these limits are found two distinct classes of rocks, all the cen
tral region being composed of crystalline unstratified rocks, irregu
larly associated with great formations of schist, which are subdivided
(agreeably to the system first published by Mr. Otley of Keswick,)
into three well defined groups; while on the outskirts of these older
formations is a broken zone of carboniferous limestone, and exten
sive deposits of superior [secondary] strata. The author avoids                                   all
mineralogical details; and after noticing the effects produced         the                   by

in  all cases accompanied with internal movements; the present po

Reasoning from analogy, the author concludes that            the great            all
diverging valleys    of
                     the Lake Mountains took their   origin    fissures                 in
probably formed during the period       the protrusion

syenite and granite.
   2ndly. He observes that the upper and lower systems        the slate            of

rocks are often violently contorted; while the central system, though
cracked and fissured as above described, hardly ever exhibits the in
dications of any flexures. This is explained by the presence of enor
mous unbending masses of compact felspar, porphyry, &c., which
are so intimately associated with the middle division of the slate that
the formations cannot be separated. The appearance is explained by
referring the felspathic rocks to some modification of sub-marine
volcanic action; by supposing that igneous and aqueous causes acted
together, and that the operations were many times repeated.
    3rdly. The mean line of bearing of the different systems is shown
to be nearly N.E. by E., and S.W. by W. This makes them, one
after the other, to abut against the carboniferous zone; from which
it follows that they must also be unconformable to             The author        it.
confirms this inference              by
                              referring     detailed sections; and, from

     1stly.    The axes       of   the several contemporaneous                   basins are not
parallel.
  2ndly. The causes which produced this arrangement appear                                               to
have partially affected the then neighbouring grauwacké regions.
Thus the transition slate     North Devon does not range parallel

    4thly. The coal-fields of the Bristol Channel have no well
 fined line of bearing, and have produced but small effects on the
 range of the superior secondary formations, which from the south
coast to the latitude of Derby are nearly parallel to the mean range
of the grauwacké chains above indicated. On the contrary, the great
carboniferous chain north of Derby has produced a direct influence
 on the bearings of the newer formations.
    He then briefly describes the structure of the great carboniferous
 chain of the North of England. The forces of elevation appear on
the whole to have acted (though not without considerable devia
tions) on a line bearing nearly north and south. The position of
 the High Peak limestone, and the great north and south faults on
its western side, are first noticed; and the axis of elevation is con
tinued by help of an anticlinal line through the region of millstone
grit, separating the Yorkshire and Lancashire coal-fields. The reap

    This memoir contains the results of observations made by the au
 thor during last summer, with the view of extending the researches
 of Professor Sedgwick and himself”; the present remarks being
 limited to the consideration of that portion of the Alps, on the
 northern side of the axis, which is included between the lake of
 Constance on the west, and Vienna on the east, followed by a short
 description of the valley of the Danube.
    1. Primary Rocks.—He notices that Mr. Partsch and himself
 discovered that traces of the primary axis of the Alps reappear in
 the Leitha-gebirge, and are there overlaid on each side by tertiary
 deposits.
      º Transition Rocks with Iron Ores are briefly alluded to, merely
 for the purpose of marking their place in the series.
    3. Rauchwacke or Magnesian Limestone.—The author shows that
 the formation is much developed near the eastern termination of
 the Austrian Alps, (St. Johann, Kirchbüchel, Söbenstein, &c.)
 that it there dips under red sandstone and Alpine limestone, and
 is quite similar to rocks occupying the same position in the Tyrol
 (Schwatz, Söll, &c.).
    4. New Red Sandstone with Salt and Gypsum.—Informer sections,
 (published by Professor Sedgwick and the author,) this formation
 is only designated in one line of valleys, i.e. along the great es
 carpment of the Alpine limestone ; recent observations have, how
 ever, convinced the author, that it is reproduced in other longitu
 dinal depressions, further removed from the axis of the chain.          In
 the valley of Abtenau, for instance, he ascertained that the red
 sandstone containing thick masses of gypsum and several salt
 springs, dips conformably on one side under black shale and lime
 stone, of the age of the lias, and on the other is overlaid uncon
 formably by the shelly deposits of Gosau.        He also cites Berchtes
 gaden, with       its
                    salt-mines,        as
                                     another case        of
                                                          valley
                                                              a       which
                                                                        in
 the new red-sandstone          denuded, and he shows that the strata
                                 is
 there dip beneath the whole            of
                                       the oolitic series         of

                                          Lias and Inferior Oolite.—It           is
 stated that the dark-coloured limestone and shale which surmount
 the red sandstone       Abtenau, range northwards with various con
                            at
 tortions, and are well exposed         the gorge

overlying red, encrinite limestone, contains at least five or six species
of Ammonites and some Belemnites;                  amongst the former is the
A. multicostatus. This red limestone              crops out on both sides of
the valley of the Salza near Hallein, and reappears in various places
 in the Salzburg Alps (Aussee, Ebensee, &c.).
    6. Salt Deposits.-The place assigned to most of the salt-mines of
the Austrian Alps in the memoir of last year, has been confirmed;
and additional sections are given at Halstadt and Aussee to prove
that the salt masses in these places are fairly encased in Alpine lime
stone.      In other localities, however, as above indicated, this mine
ral is shown to occur in the same formations as in England.
    7. Upper Alpine Limestone, or Upper Oolite—In this group the
author comprehends semi-crystalline, brecciated, scaly, compact
and dolomitic limestones.             The Hippurite limestone, though with
some      doubt,  is considered to mark the superior limit of this series,
the author      having    been led to this conclusion from the relations
seen on the north flank of the Untersberg, at Windischgarsten,Gosau
and the Wand, in                   all   of
                                 which places there are passages from the
 Alpine limestone into the Hippurite rock.
     8.  Sandstone, Calcareous Grit and Shales, Slaty Limestone, &c.—
 The Gres      de Vienne       placed
                                    is       the author  by                  as
                                                              the lowest member
of    this group; although                    in
                                      the eastern termination            the Alps           of                he
 agrees with M. Boué, that                         its
                                         separation from the Alpine limestone
                   of be
 cannot well        effected. All along the chain, however, from the Enns
to    the lake       Constance,         thinks that the grits and shales with
                                                he
 fucoids constitute         natural group distinguished

 ters from the Alpine limestone, and that they there form the lowest
 term     of the green sand.        He then describes several transverse, pa
 rallel sections across that zone. The first             these          of
                                                                        the valley     is   in                of

in which secondary fossils prevail, the author proceeds to point out
accumulations of the same age, at various heights, within the great
secondary chain of the Alps.
   In the valley of Gosau several new facts are enumerated.        The
edges  of the shelly deposit are seen to rest on red sandstone, on
Alpine and Hippurite limestone, and on green sand. , Besides the
underlying conglomerate *, the shelly system is considered to be
clearly divisible into two parts, of which the inferior contains many
secondary as well as tertiary fossils, with Tornatella (Turbinel
lus, Sow.), Nerinea,'rolled Hippurites, &c.; whilst the superior blue
marls abound with myriads of shells of a tertiary aspect, and many
corals, of species figured by Goldfuss, from the tertiary formations

order of superposition, or the equivalents of the strata.
    A memoir was then read “On the Geology of the Island of Juan

the fabulous adventures of Robinson Crusoe", the author proceeds to
state that it is about twelve miles in length and four in breadth, pos
sessing three ports, and consisting of very high land, the culminating
point of which rises to about 3005 feet above the sea.

   A notice of the same comet, from Sir Alexander Johnstone, was
communicated by Mr. Baily. It was discovered by Prof. Dabadie,
at the Mauritius, on the evening of the 16th of March. It was first
seen between the Chameleon and the great nebula. The next day it
had advanced about 5° towards the north, and it continued in this
direction with a diminished velocity, till it reached the eastern wing
of Cygnus, where it disappeared about the end of May. The length
of its tail never exceeded 5°. Professor Dabadie had no observa
tory; but he made a great number of observations of            distance                                its
from several stars, and from three                        of

    A specimen was exhibited of a small species of Deer from Chili,
which had lived in the Society's Menagerie for upwards of twelve
months, and which Mr. Bennett stated that he believed to be new.
It is a female, and consequently does not offer the accessory cha
racters which zoologists have been in the habit of deriving from
the horns.   The other distinctive marks are as follows:
   CERvus HUMILis. Cerv. parvus, obesus, brevipes ; facie latti, brevi,
     obtusá ; fissurd infra-orbitali mediocri; cauda subnullá; cor
     pore toto rufo, antice nigrescenti, postice fronte pedibusque infe
     rioribus saturationibus, infra dilutiori.
   Alt. ad humeros vix 14 ped.: long. caudae vix unciam superans.
   Mr. Bennett added that he was informed by Captain P. P. King,
R.N., that a second skin of the same species had been brought to
England by him; that the young was spotted with yellow, and had
a yellow stripe on each side of the back; and that the animal was
plentiful at Concepcion, and found even as far south as the Archi
 elago of Chiloe, living, he believed, in small herds.
   A hybrid Pheasant belonging to the Society having lately died
at the Garden, Mr. Yarrell observed that he had examined          body,                       its

   At the request    the Chairman, Mr. Martin reported the morbid

 a few hours, and the body being still warm. The same appearance
 had been not unfrequently observed by Mr. Spooner, the Veteri
 nary Surgeon of the establishment, in animals worn out by linger
 ing chronic disease.       On examining the lungs, their cellular struc
 ture was found     completely    obliterated, except in one small portion,
 where alone     any  oxygenation     of the blood could have taken place.
 They presented a dark appearance on the surface, with a hardness
 or density of structure which must have resulted from long-conti
 nued inflammation.        They were also studded with tubercles. On
 cutting into them, purulent matter oozed from the incision, and
 several abscesses, though not large, were discovered.               The liver
 was dark, and so soft as to break down with the slightest touch.
 The spleen presented no decided trace of disease. The intestines
 adjacent to the liver were tinged with a dark and somewhat purplish
 hue; but although distended with air presented nothing remark
 able.  The stomach contained only a little bile and mucus.                     -
    The muscles generally were pale and flabby, as might have been
anticipated, where a chronic disease had wasted the vital energies,
and where the blood, impeded in                    its
                                            passage through the lungs, had
long ceased       to     be

jaw.     This circumstance is interesting in connection with the me
morable dispute between Dr. Monro (primus) and the French ana
tomists, concerning the actions of this muscle; and it is remarkable
that Winslow, with his accustomed ingenuity, should have alluded
 to such a disposition, in illustrating his opinions of the actions of the
digastricus on the lower jaw in the human subject. Some peculiarities
in the mylo-hyoideus, genio-hyoideus, and omo-hyoideus were noticed.
    The peculiar muscle discovered by Tyson in the Chimpanzee, and
called by him levator claviculae, arises in the Orang Utan from the
 occiput and transverse process of the atlas. In the Chimpanzee
which Mr. Owen dissected, he also found it arising from the trans
 verse process of the atlas, and not from the second or third cervical
 vertebra. It is inserted broadly into the humeral extremity of the
                                                                           -
 clavicle.
    Neither in the Orang Utan nor in the Chimpanzee is there any true
ligamentum nuchae. The part commonly so called in the human
 subject, consisting also in these animals only of the inelastic com
 missural tendons of the trapezii, the rhomboidei and the serrati
postici superiores. To give additional support, however, to the head
 of the Orang Utan, which preponderates so far anterior to the oc
 cipital foramen, the origins of the rhomboidei are extended upwards
 to the occipital bone, to which they broadly adhere, beneath the
trapezii.     In the Chimpanzee this disposition does not occur, but
 in both animals the rhomboideus is a single muscle, without division
 into a greater and lesser portion.
    Three muscles supply the place of the pectoralis major in the
  Orang Utan. Their proportions and attachments were minutely
 described; and while speaking of these with reference to each other,
 it was found convenient to apply to them the names of sterno
humeralis, costo-humeralis, and sterno-costo-humeralis.
    The reading of the remainder of this part of the anatomy of the
 Orang Utan was postponed to a future meeting of the Committee.
    Several species of Birds belonging to the collection recently
 made by Capt. Philip P. King, R.N., during his survey of the Straits
 of Magellan, were exhibited. Other birds from the same collection
had been named and characterized at the Meeting on the 14th of
 December ; and on the present occasion Capt. King pointed out
 the distinctive characters of the following species which he believed
 to be new.

  It was announced that the Council had    Resolved, “That the
Meetings of the Committee are open to every Member of the So
ciety.” In this resolution the Committee cordially concurred; and
also in the propriety of distributing cards of the Meetings to the
Members of the Society residing in or near London.
   The skeleton and parts of the viscera of one of the Society's spe
cimens of the Chinchilla, (Chinchilla lanigera,) were exhibited, and
the following notes by Mr. Yarrell were read.
   “On the death of one of the specimens of this interesting little
animal in the collection of the Zoological Society, the Museum,
previously containing a preserved skin, was enriched with a skeleton
and preparations of parts of the viscera. Of these additions I have
been permitted to furnish a description, which I was the more de
sirous to do, as no notice of the internal parts of this animal has

  The Chairman also directed the attention of the Committee to a
remarkable deficiency observable in some of the groups of the Psit
tacidae, viz. the absenceof the os furcatorium. This deficiency he had
observed in the osteology of the Psittacus mitratus, the Platycercus
eximius,and the Psittacula galgula; skeletons of the two last of which
species were exhibited.     He observed that this extraordinary defi
ciency evinced the approaching affinity of that group of birds to
the Rasores, one of the most conspicuous groups of which, the typi
cal Struthionidae, exhibited a like deficiency, indicating a corre
sponding failure in the powers of flight.

   At half-past eleven the aurora again began to sink slowly, and
did not rise afterwards.   At five minutes before twelve a large bril
liant meteor, the only one observed through the night, passed under
Ursa Major.      At one o'clock A.M. the highest part of the aurora
about the magnetic north had sunk to within six or seven degrees
of the horizon; yet bright coruscations occasionally emanated from
it till two, when the observations were discontinued, as no more
interesting meteoric appearances were likely to occur.             -
   The vertex of each of the rainbow-like arches that were forme
by streamers from or near the intersecting points of the aurora with
the horizon, coincided with the magnetic north within one or two
degrees, and uniformly preserved this parallelism in passing off
towards the south.
   During the evening and night, while the aurora was pretty high,
the light which it spread through the atmosphere was equal to the
light of the moon shining through a very attenuated cloud; and the
stars which formed the square and tail of Ursa Major were almost
imperceptible, in consequence of the refulgence of the aurora.
   Of all the aurorae boreales that have been observed here the
last twenty years (some say forty years), this was the most exten
sive, the most beautiful in colours, and the most interesting, on ac
count of the singular phaenomena which it displayed, in the number
of distinct luminous bows, which were presented in the course of
the night. This aurora borealis was seen at Paris and at Brussels.
   In two days and a half after the aurora a very strong gale of
wind came on from the north-east, and continued about twenty-four
hours.
   There were also faint aurorae on the preceding and following
evenings; and a luminous one, though not high, from six till nine
in the evening of the 11th, which would have been interesting but
for the interposition of clouds throughout the night.
 A MODE OF ASCERTAINING THE WALUE OF MANGANESE ORIES.
   Dr. Turner, Professor of Chemistry in the London University, has
given a method of ascertaining the commercial value of the ores of
manganese, in the last Number of the Royal Institution Journal, the
object being solely to ascertain the relative quantities of chlorine,
which an equal weight of each ore was capable of supplying.           The

    General Observations.—The first part of this month was dry, the latter
 part was wet and alternately mild and cold, with occasional gales of wind.
After the aurora borealis in the evening of the 11th, the sky was hidden
 by clouds till the 24th, with the exception of about one day.              -
    On the 23rd the thermometer in the shade rose to fifty-three degrees, and
on the 26th only to thirty-four degrees: in the night of the 22nd it receded
only to forty-six degrees, but in the night of the 25th, to twenty-five de
grees, the minimum temperature for the month.
    On the 25th and 26th there was a uniform elevation of the mercury in
the barometer, but a very sudden depression of four-fifths of an inch on
the 27th, with rain. On the 28th and 29th the mercury rose half an inch
in the tube, and a little snow came on with an easterly wind. On the de
scent of the mercury on the 31st between three and four inches of snow
fell here in the night, even with a strong gale from the south. In the
neighbourhood of London upwards of two feet in depth of snow are said to
have fallen upon a plane surface about the same time; and in places where
it had drifted, the stage-coaches could not pass before it was cleared away,
consequently they were several hours behind their usual time.
   The atmospheric and meteoric phaenomena that have come within our
observations this month, are one lunar halo, four meteors, four aurorae
boreales, and seven gales of wind, or days on which they have prevailed,
namely, four from the North-east, one from the East, one from the South,
and one from the South-west.

   I shall now proceed to give an example of the use of this
formula and table, a duty which I hold to be incumbent on
every person who proposes any new ones for general use. On
the 9th of February 1830, the second limb of the moon was
                                      2   I2                           observed

observed at Greenwich at 13° 36" apparent time, and at the
Cape of Good Hope at 12" 20" apparent Greenwich time;
each being estimated to the nearest minute. , Consequently
the middle point of time, between the two observations, is
# (c + x) = 0° 58" from the
                                      preceding midnight: and the
successive differences of the moon's right ascension, taken from
the Nautical Almanac, will be as follow: viz.

 Therefore, by entering the table with the argument                     #  (c--x),
 we have the respective logarithms          of    the -

 if we had s = 24h 3m 57*.6, and A = + 2* 26°315, the

same may be remarked of Bagay’s Tables”, by far the cheapest
and best volume of the sort which ever appeared; and as to
Weisse's Planetary Tablesl, we much doubt if two copies
have as yet reached England. The compendious nature and
simplicity of these tables are such as to recommend them
especially to the notice of every astronomer, but their merits
in these respects are counterbalanced by indistinct type and
numerous errors, of which no corrections are furnished by the
author. To supply this deficiency, and with a hope that a cor
rect reprint of this convenient little book may either be un
dertaken here or introduced from the continent, a list is sub
joined of        byall       the errata   the more valuable parts

XLIII.       On the Rectification of Curves.                      By Mr. CHARLEs GILL.
 To the       Editors of the Philosophical                    Magazine and Annals.
         Gentlemen,                                               *
WHILE    investigating
  I was lately led to
                            the properties of a family of curves,
                             remark, that the elegant property
demonstrated    by   Mr.  Beverley,  in your Number for June
1826, is capable of considerable extension.      Under the idea
that anything tending to the simplification of this abstruse
problem will be viewed with satisfaction by your mathematical
readers, I submit to you the result of my labours.
    The proposition may be more generally enunciated thus:
Let C be any point in a given curve line of any order, and B,
a point any how given by position: join B C, and draw BQ,
CQ to meet in Q, and contain a given angle (3), C Q being
also a tangent to the curve. Then the rectification of the
curve which is the locus of the point Q may be generally ex
pressed by         <U+017F>I)
                   C cosec 6. 20, 3 being the angle B Q makes
with a fixed  axis, taken at pleasure.
     Let B M be a fixed axis, and let Z M B C = p, and
CBQ     = 0     p. –Now whatever be the nature of the curve
in which C     moves, or the po
sition of the point B, the equa
tion of the curve may be ex
pressed by BC = 3 (p)a func
                       #.
tion of the angle M B C, and
given lines.          Bc indefi
nitely near BC, and with cen-       M                       B
tre B and radius BC describe
the small arc Cr; then, in the elementary triangle Cre, we
have Cr = BC. dº = dº. 8 (4), cr = — d. BC =              p. 8 (?),                    -d
(putting d? (p) = d ?. 3' (?)), and ZC cr = 180°–3–0+ p :

Art.       II.
                   THE  configuration of the valleys which appear to
                     have resulted from excavation, especially the
 intersection by transverse valleys of continuous longitudinal
 valleys, themselves opening possible outlets to the drainage,
 is inconsistent with the theory which assigns the drainage of
 the atmospherical waters as the excavating agent.
     Observations.—If any difficulty should be felt at first sight
 in exactly appreciating any of the terms employed in the above
 short general enunciation of the principle here maintained,
I   shall trust fully to explain them in proceeding with the de
 tail. In the first place, I would propose to class our valleys
 according to the apparent difference of their probable origin;
 although the excavating action of water may very probably
have materially modified them generally, yet it would be
clearly inconsistent with the phaenomena to refer their origin
exclusively to this cause; the convulsive forces which have
acted on the surface of our planet have often dislocated                                                its
strata, elevating one portion and depressing another from the
level      of
            their planes                  of
                              deposition, and again contorting and
bending them into the zigzag form              the letter (W).    Now of
in   the first case the lines     subsidence, and  of   the second the          in
concave reentering angles, would naturally form valleys; these
I  would term generally valleys          dislocation:        of should               or

 have been formed by excavation.    Moreover this account of
 their origin seems to follow as an almost necessary corollary
  from the phaenomena, of the gravel derived from the water
  worn fragments torn from the mass of those strata, which
  were detailed in the foregoing article: for the existence of
 this gravel obviously presupposes the partial destruction of the
 strata which yielded                    it.
 I     shall now, then, more particularly examine, the physical
 structure      of
                the districts which are thus especially affected                                                   by
  valleys    of
             excavation.
     These districts are occupied              strata disposed         by
                                                                       planes                           in

                                5°      or
 strata, therefore, usually forms acclivities             gentle slope along       of
 the back       of
               the  strata;   their termination      against   the substrata
 (or, as   it technically termed, their basset edge) presents,
                is                                                                                                on
 the contrary,             an
                        abrupt escarpment, traversing the strata,
 Beneath these     escarpments,      therefore, we generally find ex
tended valleys ranging                direction parallel
                                                in   a            the strata,                 to
which have     usually   been   distinguished         longitudinal    valleys.as
 But besides these, other      systems       valleys  occur     of
                                                              cutting  across

 prolonged so as to expire insensibly against the more elevated
 portions of the substrata, which, on emerging, usually rise to
 higher levels;–so that the whole surface at first presented one
 uniform declivity, nearly uninterrupted. The Fluvialists must
 then suppose that the drainage across this declivity excavated
 the transverse valleys as                       its

tion of the same phaenomena, and explain in detail, on his
own hypothesis, the exact manner in which the valleys of the
Thames and its tributaries can have been formed.
    Lest it should be imagined that the circumstances of this
river are in any manner peculiar, I will add a short examina
tion of the various streams which traverse the portion of our
island occupied by the more horizontal strata, and in which
therefore the valleys are attributable to excavation rather than
dislocation.       This district, as it is known, extends diagonally
across the island, from the south of Durham to the east of
Devon; the more horizontal formations occupying                                the                      all

   262 Rev.W. D. Conybeare on the Phaenomena of Geology
    this? Seeing that since the Romans occupied Eboracum 1700
   years ago, that agency has not effected a degradation of
    7 inches on any one of the valla of their encampments, we
   may perhaps have sufficient data to calculate upon.        I leave
   the Fluvialists to work out the question at leisure, offering in
   the meanwhile, as a mere approximation, an infinitillion of
   ages in the nth power.
       3. We next come to the breach of the riverWitham, through
   the oolitic range at Lincoln, where a dam of very trifling ele
   vation would at once turn it into the Trent.
                                W.j
      5. South of this the oolitic range is broken through by the
   transverse valleys of the             and Nen: but as the head
   waters of these streams rise almost within the limits of these
                                                                 j
   valleys, I shall not insist on them; though as the breaches tra
  verse the whole chain, I do not see how the Fluvialist can ac
  count for them without filling up the subjacent plains on the
  north-west as before.
      6.  I now arrive at my old ground, the district containin
  the Cherwell and other head waters of the Thames;
  must refer to my former observations.
      7. The chalk range is broken through not only by the
  Thames, but by a very considerable number of valleys, a
  complete transverse valley occurring almost every 10 miles
  throughout the course of that formation. Many of these valleys
  afford a passage to actual streams; and many others, quite an
 equal number       I believe, are totally destitute of such rivers,
 and yet bear every character of being truly valleys of excava
 tion. The chalk, indeed, as must be familiar to those who
 have resided long in any district chiefly composed of it (the
 locality of much of my own youth), abounds in valleys devoid
 of water, the stratum being so absorbent as generally at once
 to swallow up the atmospheric showers without allowing them
 to collect into rills. Now I very earnestly wish that the Fluvi
 alists would inform me how these valleys, which neither have
 nor ever have had streams flowing through them, have been
 formed by the erosion of the said non-existing streams.
     8. The valleys of excavation at the south-western extremity
of our district, Dorset and Devon, have been fully described in
an essay by my friend Buckland in the Geological Transac
                                                       I
tions, vol. v.; and wherever he has preceded me, am always
content with reference only.
     9. I will conclude therefore with the south-eastern extre
mity, the Weald of Kent. It is well known that the axis and
saddle of this district consists of a range of sand denominated
(from the place where it terminates on the coast) the Hastings
Sand. Round this axis mantle the upper and ferruginous
                                                             5.
                                                              Sailo

                    bearing on theoretical Speculations.                            263
sand and the chalk. On the north, both these formations form
chains of steep escarpment separated by deep longitudinal
valleys from the central axis and from each other; but on
the south, from the general degradation of the sand, the chalk
alone forms a regular escarpment.      Now most of the main
streams of this district have their head waters in the central
axis;  whence those running northwards into the Thames
have to intersect by transverse valleys the two barriers of the
Kentish rag hills and of the northern chalk downs, neglect
ing the two intervening longitudinal valleys, into which a dam
of less than 100 feet high erected in any of these breaches,
which are about 600 feet high, would turn the drainage
towards the Straits of Dover.   Such are the circumstances of
the Wey, the Mole, and the Medway; the Darent and the
Stour rising almost within the limits of the rag hills, indeed,
can scarcely be said to break through more than one of these
barriers, the chalk. On the south side we have the Arun,
the Ader, the Ouse, and the Cuckmere, which in like manner
break through the single opposing barrier of the chalky South
Downs (as the sands do not on this side present a regular
escarpment). Now it is I think quite inconceivable that fluvia
tile erosion could possibly have produced such a configura
tion, unless we suppose that the surface originally, when the
drainage commenced            work, presented uniform slopes from
                                   its

and the sea        on
                  the other,   the intermediate   longitudinal  valleys
having been then filled up; and that while the direct drainage
excavated the transverse valleys, the lateral drainage exca

                                                       of
which    they  were  precipitated,     instead       having allowed their      of
planes uniformly           extend until they abutted against those
                                to
older ridges: for we must suppose the oceans which deposited
these strata       have possessed some lines
                     to                                   shore; these we            of
may naturally conceive                indicated  to   bethe most elevated       by
crests  of  the older ridges: against such lines            coast, currents              of
most   probably    have   ranged.    While therefore the depositions
were proceeding quietly               the deeper and more tranquil

escarpments often                of
                           considerable abruptness.
    To examine into the causes which may have modified and
increased these longitudinal valleys, and produced the trans
verse defiles, we should,           apprehend,   I     the first place pro      in
ceed   regularly       investigate
                          to          what would          the probable ac            be

strata,    which our attention
          to                           now confined,      conclude,

  would be likewise gradual. Now the lines indicating the main
  direction towards which the waters in their subsidence must
 tend, being coincident with the dip of the strata over the
 backs of which the descent was taking place, must of course
 have been transverse to the bearing of those strata: the ge
 neral currents of the so descending waters would therefore
 naturally tend to produce transverse furrows in the strata:
 hence would the transverse valleys originate; while at the
 same time the longitudinal valleys would be materially modi
 fied; the descending currents setting against the escarpments
 of the strata would naturally tend to undermine them, and
 from the direction of the inclination of their planes would act
 to advantage, especially as we usually find the longitudinal
 valleys extending into the softer alternating strata, such as
 clay, and sand, and the harder rocks constituting the over
 hanging escarpment: hence the undermining agency of the
 waves operating with facility on these softer materials, would
 considerably increase the breadth of the longitudinal valleys
 and render the escarpments steeper and more abrupt.               In
 proportion as the depression of the sea-level was gradual,
 there may have been a long continued reiteration of tidal waves
 sweeping over the same tracts.         Ihappen at the present mo
 ment to have     directly beneath  my  eyes a complete illustration
 of the necessary consequences of the action of tidal waves on
 strata gradually inclined,—residing within a few yards of a
 coast formed by such strata (of magnesian limestone); these
 dip towards the sea under a very gentle angle, only about 2°.
 The ebb consequently exposes a band of them of considerable
breadth, more than a furlong; the whole of this band has been
 eroded by the tidal waves into a complete and most illustra
 tive model, presenting on the small scale             all
                                                     the phaenomena
 above described, escarpments overhanging expanded longi
tudinal depressions, transverse breaches, &c. &c. And            may  I
add, that the tidal action very commonly does actually pro
duce what Mr. Lyell, following Mr. Scrope, fancies can result
only from fluvial action, namely, serpentine and meandering
furrows often  of    considerable depth and length.         need not
                                                                I
add what pleasure    it    would give me    by see either gentleman
here, and convince him     of   the fact      to
                                             ocular demonstration.
I  have indeed been surprised how this argument could have
been   so    strongly urged  by  two observers,         to

                                          cataracts are inconsistent
with the fluvial   hypothesis.
   The fluvial hypothesis requires me believe, that since the           to
emergence           of
                  our continents the atmospheric drainage has
commonly furrowed them into valleys hundreds                   miles                        of           in
length, and hundreds          feet      depth;-that the streamlets
                                            of          in
forming the Thames, for instance, have done this. But such                                        if
have been the effects       these comparatively tranquil streams,
                                         of
 what must the effects have been of volume of water like that a
of Niagara precipitated      thundering fury  in      here indeed                 !   I
take     for granted that Thames and Niagara have been
        it
acting        on
           the surface for the same period.        this     denied,               If         be
I shall certainly require     reason for that a denial,   and shall
wish    to     be
            informed what      the exact seniority
                                                 is     old Father                     of

Thames over young Niagara. Meanwhile considering them as
coaeval, I will ask how                       I
                            am to account for the mighty effects
ascribed to the  Thames,   within a period during which the ut
most effects that can be ascribed to Niagara are the gradual
wearing away of the bar over which it rushes, for a distance not
exceeding 7 miles; for the general range of the mountains which
occasions those falls extends only that distance eastwards from
their present site, when the hills entirely subside into the flats
bordering Lake Ontario, and of course the original site of the
falls cannot have been beyond the extreme escarpment of
those hills. Mr. Lyell, taking for his datum that the falls have
receded near 50 yards within the last 40 years, calculates that
they must have occupied 10,000 years in retrograding from the
original to the actual position, and that it will require 30,000
more for them to reach Lake Erie. But if both the actions
º
I
 commenced together, must it not have completed this effect
 of
        before the Thames could have excavated even a third
        present valley? Taking Mr. Lyell’s own determinations,
      do its
        not know       more striking instance
                          a                              the comparativelyof

 but  I   must confess      my   doubts whether the falls         actually
 recede,       as
               far     their general line
                          as                     concerned,   is   the rate             at

                                         suspicion are these: The falls

          is well known, divided             the centrein           extremely      by   an

thousand pounds in the three per cent, reduced bank annuities, in
the joint names of himself and the Geological Society, he directed:
that after his decease “the Society should apply the dividends in pro
moting researches concerning the mineral structure of the earth, or
in rewarding those by whom such researches might hereafter be made;
or in such manner as should appear to the Council of the said Society
for the time being, conducive to the interests of the Society in parti
cular, or the science of geology in general,” &c. And he afterwards
enjoined the Society “not to hoard the dividends parsimoniously, but
to expend them liberally, and, as far as might be, annually, in further
ing the objects of the trust.”
   Such, Gentlemen, was the letter of our instructions : and as we
were enjoined to expend the proceeds of the Donation Fund, as far
as might be, annually; I will read an extract from the Report of the
Council at the preceding Anniversary, as it will explain our motives
for withholding, on that occasion, the distribution of the dividends.
   “The Council have not thought it expedient to make as yet any
distribution of the dividends arising from this fund, but have appro
priated the first year's income to the acquisition of a die for a medal
which is to bear the head of Dr. Wollaston: and they hope that the
Society will approve of this endeavour to perpetuate in the minds of
geologists the memory of their illustrious benefactor. The first an
nual distribution, therefore, of the Wollaston Medal, as well as a cer
tain sum of money, will be awarded at the next anniversary according
to the provision of the bequest.”—(Feb. 19th, 1830.)
    Mr. Chantrey kindly undertook to carry the resolution of the
Council into effect; and under his directions Mr. Wyon of the Royal
Mint was employed to execute a die, which we hope before long to
see finished.   We met, therefore, in the early part of this year to act
upon the letter of our instructions, and we recorded our award in
the following Resolutions.
      Extract from the Minute-book of the Council, Jan. l 1, 1831.
    Resolved unanimously—l. “That a Medal of fine gold, bearing the
impress of the Head of Dr. Wollaston, and not exceeding the value
of ten guineas, be procured with the least possible delay.”
    2. “That the first Wollaston Medal be given to Mr. William
Smith, in consideration of his being a great, original discoverer in
English Geology; and especially for his having been the first, in this
country, to discover and to teach the identification of strata, and to
determine their succession by means of their imbedded fossils.”
   The first gold medal struck from the die now in progress will
therefore be sent to Mr. Smith; and we have added to it a purse of
twenty guineas, from the dividends of the “Donation Fund,” which
it is now my duty publicly to present to him in the name of the Geo
logical Society. His great and original works are known to you all;
and I might well refer to them for our justification, and without any
further preface place the prize in   hishand, offering him my hearty
congratulations.  But since his arrival    London, within the last few
                                           in

Somerset Coal Canal); and ascertained that the several beds, found
in the high escarpments around Bath, were brought down by an
eastern dip, in regular succession, to the level of his lines of section.
During these two years Mr. Smith was in the constant habit of ma
king collections of fossils, with strict indications of their localities; and
in completing the details of his transverse sections, he found, where
the beds themselves were obscure, that he could by organic remains
alone determine the true order of succession.        During this period he
also extended his  surveys    through  the Cotteswold Hills, and became
acquainted with the general facts of the range of the oolitic escarp
ment towards the North of England.
   In the year 1794 he crossed the whole series of formations, and
marked their escarpments between Bath and London; and afterwards
extended his surveys to the Durham and Northumberland coal
field: while on his way, partly by actual sections and partly by the
help of external contours, with which his eye was now familiar, he
ascertained the range of the chalk to Flamborough Head, and of
the oolitic series, through a regular succession of escarpments, to
the Hambleton Hills and the cliffs of Yorkshire.              Combining the
facts discovered in this excursion with the distribution of the for
mations in the south-western parts of England, he began to record
his observations by colouring geological maps. Several documents
of this kind are now unfortunately lost; but have been informedI
by Mr. Phillips (Curator of the museum of the Yorkshire Philo
sophical Society), that he possesses a valuable geological map, co
loured by Mr. Smith in the year 1800, connecting the structure of
the North of England, which at that time he had not again visited,
with the structure of the South-western districts; and delineating
the whole oolitic series through England, in some places very cor

or of any law regulating the distribution of organic forms.-Michell
was a man of great talents, and undoubtedly made out the true rela
tions of the secondary deposits in one portion of this island; but he
was, I believe, ignorant of the importance of organic remains, and did
not use them as a means of identifying strata.—Lister is distinguished
among the writers of the seventeenth century as the first to propose
the construction of mineralogical maps, and he had some limited no
tions of the distribution of organic fossils, though he misunderstood
both their nature and importance.
   The works of these authors were, however, entirely unknown to Mr.
Smith during his early life, and every step of his progress was made
without any assistance from them.*. But I will go further, and affirm,
that had they          been known all   him, they would take nothing       to
from the substantial merit     his discoveries. Fortunately placed

—by help of it disentangled the structure of a considerable part of
England—and never rested from his labours till the public was fairly
in possession of his principles. If these be not the advances of
an original mind,               I
                          do not know where we are to find them ; and                                               I
affirm with     confidence,  after the facts already stated, that the Council
was   justified    in the terms of their award, and that Mr. William
Smith was “the first, in this country, to discover and to teach the
identification of strata, and to determine their succession by means
of their imbedded fossils.”
   After the year 1795, he turned his knowledge to effect in his va
rious employments as civil engineer. Works of drainage were carried
on by him on the principles of stratification—his stratigraphical col
lections were continually increased—he sketched geological sections
on the lines of local surveys (many of which have been since pub
lished)—and traced geological lines of demarcation upon various
county maps. Of these I may mention an excellent map of Somer
setshire, coloured on the scale of an inch to a mile, and publicly ex
hibited and explained at an annual agricultural meeting at Bath, in
the year 1799; and another map (publicly exhibited at the same
time, and now, I rejoice to tell you, on the table of this Society) of
the country six miles round Bath; representing                     the different              all

him in the fields, I soon found to be the fact, and also, that they had
a general inclination to the south-east, following each other in regu
 lar succession.
    With the open liberality peculiar to Mr. Smith, he wished me to
communicate this to the Rev. J. Townsend of Pewsey (then in Bath),
 who was not less surprised at the discovery. But we were soon much
 more astonished by proofs of his own collecting, that whatever stra
 tum was found in any part of England, the same remains would be
 found in it and no other.   Mr. Townsend, who had pursued the sub
ject 40 or 50 years, and had travelled over the greater part of civi
 lized Europe, declared it perfectly unknown to        his acquaintance,                    all

 but when it appears again on the opposite coast: that in strata of
 considerable comparative depth fossils are found, which are not
 discovered in any of the superincumbent       beds: that some fossils,
 which abound in the      lower,   are found in diminishing numbers
 through several of the superincumbent, and are entirely wanting in
                                                                        -
 the uppermost strata #,” &c. &c.
    To this passage, the author appends a note, commencing as fol
 lows:– “This mode of conducting our inquiries was long since
recommended by Mr. W. Smith, who first noticed that certain fos
sils are peculiar to, and are only found lodged in, particular strata;
and who first ascertained the constancy in the order of super
position, and the continuity of the strata of this island,” &c. &c.
    One quotation more and I have done. The Reverend J. Town
send of Pewsey, in the first volume of a work published in 1813
 (entitled “The Character of Moses established for Veracity as an
Historian”), described at considerable length the secondary strata
of England; and after referring nearly the whole of his information
to Mr. Smith, adds the following words:—“The discoveries of this
skilful engineer have been of vast importance to geology, and will
be of infinite value to the nation.     To a strong understanding, a
retentive  memory,   indefatigable  ardour,  and a more than common
sagacity, this extraordinary man unites a perfect contempt for
money, when compared with science.          Had he kept his discoveries
to  himself,  he  might have accumulated wealth; but with unparal
leled disinterestedness of mind, he scorned concealment, and made
known his discoveries to every one who wished for information. It
is now eleven years since he conducted the Author in his examina
tion of the strata which are laid bare in the immediate vicinity of
Bath; and subsequent excursions in the stratified and calcareous
portions of our island have confirmed the information thus ob
tained.”
   Knowledge thus orally communicated, gradually and insensibly
became a part of the public stock; and beyond doubt “produced
a very important, though unobserved effect upon the labours of                                    all
succeeding inquirers, who have been, perhaps unconsciously, but
not less really, indebted         Mr. Smith for very essential assistance
                                   to

maps, the result of incredible labour, and admirable for many of
their details; and of a value known to every English geologist who
has laboured in the field.
    I  for one can speak with gratitude of the practical lessons I have
received from Mr. Smith: it was by tracking his footsteps, with
his maps in my hand, through Wiltshire and the neighbouring coun
ties, where he had trodden nearly thirty years before, that I first
learnt the subdivisions of our oolitic series, and apprehended the
meaning of those arbitrary and somewhat uncouth terms, which we
derive from him as our master, which have long become engrafted
into the conventional language of English geologists, and, through
their influence, have been, in part, also adopted by the naturalists
of the Continent.
    After such a statement, Gentlemen,            have a right to speak I
boldly, and to demand your approbation of the Council's award—
I   could almost dare to wish, that stern lover of truth, to whose
bounty we owe the “Donation Fund"—that dark eye, before the
glance of which                  all
                           false pretensions withered, were once more

 282                              Geological Society.
consideration of one or two great questions which have lately been
pressed upon our attention*.
   A paper by Mr. Weaver on the physical structure of the South of
Ireland demands our first notice. It is accompanied with a geolo
gical map, extending to the limits of a similar map of the East of
Ireland, published by him in a former volume of our Transactions;
and we have thus obtained from his unassisted labours an accurate
geographical distribution of the formations spread over more than
half that island. But great as they are, these are not the only
obligations we owe to that excellent observer. He has described with
the clearest details the various formations of the South of Ireland,
commencing with the contorted and highly inclined groups of the
older transition rocks, and ending with the unconformable deposits
of old red sandstone and carboniferous limestone.
   The order of succession, as far as it goes, is in exact accordance
with that of our island, and the beds of transition limestone subor
dinate to the greywacké contain nearly the same series of organic
remains as the corresponding beds of Gloucestershire, Cumberland,
and South Wales. Amidst the uncertainty of some of our conclu
sions derived from the organic types of deposits remote from each
other, we seem in these transition fossils to have a secure starting
point; and whether derived from the flanks of the Austrian Alps, the
eastern plains of Gallicia, the central regions of Russia, or the grey
 wacké chains of northern Germany or North America, they have at
least a family resemblance not easily mistaken.
    In the limestone of Cork Mr. Weaver observed impressions of the
 vertebrae of fishes associated with the fossils abounding in the grey
 wacké slate of the neighbouring country.        The fact is in perfect ac
cord with our present knowledge.            Impressions of fish have long
been known of in some varieties of transition slate; certain families of
crustacea are eminently characteristic of formations of the same age;
remains of fish are commonly found in the mountain limestone of
$.
Bristol; shark's teeth occur in the mountain limestone of Northum
                 I
berland; and need not perhaps remind you that impressions of fish
               accompanied with crustacea) are found in incredible abun
  ance   among   the bituminous schists associated with the old red con
glomerates of Caithness.         Yet such is the inveteracy of our preju
dices in favour of the      hypothesis which admits nothing but what we
suppose the simplest forms of animal life into the older strata, that
even now we receive the facts opposed to it with doubt and hesitation.
   What above         all
                       distinguishes the greywacké series       of

niferous limestone of the neighbouring districts, was an important
addition to our information, and was               with no small surprise
by many members of this Society.            It gives  us, however, a new
term of    comparison   with the  phaenomena    of distant countries. The
greywacké chain of Magdeburg contains innumerable impressions of
true coal plants, and some of the carboniferous deposits on the con
fines of Westphalia partake (like the deposits in the South of Ireland)
of all the contortions of the older transition series.
    On the descriptions of the old red sandstone and the carboniferous
limestone I shall make no comments; but I think it right to recall your
attention to some valuable details respecting the metalliferous depo
sits in the counties of Cork and Kerry. The copper ore of Ross
Island, on the lake of Killarney, does not constitute either metalli
ferous beds or true veins, but is distributed in the form of branches
or strings, contemporaneous, like those of calcareous spar, with the
limestone rocks they traverse. At Mucruss mine, in the same neigh
bourhood, copper ore was obtained from a true metalliferous bed.
In Kenmare the deposits of lead ore are shown to be discontinuous
masses, nearly parallel in range and dip to the regular strata.
    In the county of Cork the most valuable mine of copper is opened
in a true vein: but the author remarks that in some parts of this
county there is a very general diffusion of cupreous matter, some
times appearing in separate particles, and sometimes in strings,
veins or filaments more or less connected with each other, but not
continuous, and therefore contemporaneous with the rocks to which
they are subordinate.       Such repositories of metals might not inaptly
be termed “veins of segregation,” as they seem to have been formed
by a separation of parts during the gradual passage of the mineral
masses into a solid state.
    In England we have almost every variety of metalliferous deposits.
Near Whitehaven in Cumberland great masses of reniform hematite
alternate with red beds of mountain limestone. At Nosterfield, near
Bedale, a true bed charged with sulphuret of lead alternates with the
upper strata of magnesian limestone.         The great copper pipe veins of
Ecton must have been contemporaneous with the shale limestone
to which they are subordinate. The great lead veins of our northern
counties originated, if I mistake not, in cracks formed during the ele
vation of the carboniferous chain, before the period of the new red
sandstone.
    In Cornwall we have, as is well known, both on the great scale
 and the small, every modification of veined structure.         Tin is dis
 tributed through some of the granitoid rocks where no vein is visible,
The slate rocks, near their junction with the granite, are traversed by
 veins of injection, and some of these are metalliferous, (for example,
 the slate series of Cumberland are so carbonaceous as to have given rise to
 borings and other works in search of coal.      I have been informed that
 similar unsuccessful attempts were formerly made in North Devon. But in
 none of these instances, I believe, were true coal beds and plants, like
 those described by Mr. Weaver, ever discovered.

band of transition limestone imbedded in the upper portion of these
older formations: and from the phaenomena described, certain facts
(important in the physical history of the mountain groups) become
securely established.
    1. Great cracks were formed at a very ancient epoch, and probably
during the first period of elevation, diverging from the central regions
of the Lake Mountains; and such enormous shifts took place in the
position of the shattered strata, that in several instances the broken
ends of the same bed are more than a mile apart, the distance being
measured in a direction at right angles to the lines of bearing.                In
after periods many of the existing valleys were scooped out upon the
lines of fracture.
    2. The central schistose groups abut in succession against the car
boniferous zone; and from this fact alone (independently of many
others bearing upon the same point), the two systems are proved to
be unconformable.
    3. The mean bearing of the great central groups, notwithstanding
their enormous dislocations,                          is,
                                       with very slight deviations, north-east
 by  east, and south-west         west. Now thisby       nearly the mean bear       is

what the changes consist, and what are their modifications.
   All our coal formations are essentially composed                 mountain                  of
limestone, sandstone, and shale          they differ only
                                                   :            the mode                in                     in
which these constituents are aggregated.—In the various coal-basins
  on the Bristol Channel, the limestone-beds are developed only                                                in
the lower, and the coal-bearing-beds           the upper partbyin the series;                 of
and the two members are separated             nearly unproductive deposits
of millstone-grit and shale.
   Almost       the same words we may describe the carboniferous series
               in
 ofDerbyshire. There, however, the millstone-grit             more complex,         is
and     very great thickness
         of                       and subordinate
                                        ;                the great shale are, to
here and there, very thick masses         peculiar, thin-bedded and some
                                                    of   a

   On the re-appearance         the carboniferous limestone,

of  the Yorkshire chain, we still find the same general analogies                                              of
structure: enormous masses           limestone form the lowest part, and
                                            of
the rich coal-fields the highest part                     of   the whole series; and,                     as

the former instances, we also find the millstone-grit occupying an
intermediate position.   The millstone-grit, however, becomes a very
complex deposit, with several subordinate beds of coal; and is sepa
rated from the great inferior calcareous group (known in the North
of England by the name of scar lime-stone), not merely by the great
shale and shale-limestone, as in Derbyshire, but by a still more com
plex deposit, in some places not less than 1000 feet thick; in which
five groups of limestone strata, extraordinary for their perfect con
tinuity and unvarying thickness, alternate with great masses of
sandstone and shale, containing innumerable impressions of coal
plants, and three or four thin beds of good coal extensively worked
for domestic use.
   In the range of the carboniferous chain from Stainmoor, through
the ridge of Cross Fell, to the confines of Northumberland,     we have
a repetition of the same general phaenomena.     On      eastern flanks,                          its

the millstone-grit, the alternations                                  of
                                                   limestone and coal measures

  their roots     inthe black soil, and their upper portions             the lime                        in
  stone: and from these facts the authors conclude—that the surface
  of   the Portland rock was once dry land—and that                         grew                         on   it         a
  forest containing plants              tropical form—that this forest was
                                            of   a

  away—that upon this ancient forest were accumulated the mixed
 formations       the Wealds, not much less than 1000 feet
                 of                                                   thickness—                    in

 add—that these marine        deposits   again  became    dry  land, upon    which
 lived great tribes              of

various essays, published during the past year, on the structure of
the Alpine and Carpathian chains*.
   In elucidation of the geology of the Eastern Alps, a paper was also
presented to the Society, during the past year, by Mr. Murchison
and myself.     Our object was, by help of a transverse section along
the line where we crossed the Chain, to bring together such facts
as were seen by ourselves, and appeared of any real importance: and,
connecting them with other facts, partly derived from oral informa
tion, and partly from a number of scattered memoirs little known in
this country, to give such an outline of the general structure of
the whole chain, as should be intelligible to an English reader.
   As our Memoir has been published, I should hardly have alluded to
it, had not our views been partially misrepresented; and, what                                                          is   of
vastly more importance, had we not differed from Dr. Boué          the                                              in

still less able to define the limits of the secondary and tertiary series.
For, sometimes resting unconformably among the serrated peaks of
the higher mountains, and sometimes in a position intermediate be
tween the outer zone of the chain and the tertiary plains descending
towards the Danube, we found great complex deposits, apparently
graduating at one extremity into the secondary, and at the other
into the tertiary system, and abounding in fossils, which in a great
majority of the species seemed to conform to the tertiary type.
Upon this mixed evidence we concluded that these singular deposits
formed a true connecting link between the secondary and tertiary
systems of the region; and, though unknown in our own country and
the North of France, were to be placed somewhere between the cal
caire grossier and the chalk.
   To the clearing up of this point (on which alone we had any essen
tial disagreement with Dr. Boué). Mr. Murchison has devoted the
most elaborate details of his recent Memoir. He first describes the
extension of the primary axis into the Leitha-gebirge, which thus
seems to form a connecting link between the Alpine and Hungarian
chains, and notices some new and interesting localities of the mag
nesian limestone and red marl series.        He then traces the reappear
ance of the    gypseous   and saliferous  marls, apparently of the age of
the new red sandstone, in some longitudinal valleys of the Salzburg
Alps; and by means of detailed sections, fixes the great salt deposits
of Aussee and Halstadt between the older Alpine limestone based
upon lias, and the newer limestone terminating in the Hippurite rock.
He afterwards gives various sections of the Vienna sandstone group,
and shows that it is the equivalent of the green-sand and chalk; and
proves, by very elaborate details, chiefly derived from the banks of the
Traun, that in the enormous development of the nummulite series one
part graduates into the secondary, and another into the tertiary sy
stem of the Eastern Alps; thus confirming by new and uninterrupted
sections the justness of our former classification.
   Among the novel and important observations in this Memoir, the
author describes a deposit, at Ortenburg in the valley of the Danube,
composed of chalk with flints, supporting tertiary sands and clays, and
resting horizontally upon the primary rocks of the Bohemian chain.
Arguing from this fact he shows, (agreeably to the system of M. Elie
de Beaumont,) that the elevation of the Alpine and Bohemian chains
took place at two distinct periods.
   In glancing over the various papers on the structure of the Eastern
Alps, it was impossible for me entirely to separate the descriptions
of the older and newer systems; but I now proceed to notice some
communications almost exclusively devoted to the phaenomena of ter
tiary deposits.
   A paper was laid before the Society by Mr. Murchison and myself,
during the past year, on the Tertiary Formations of Lower Styria.
In an east and west section, from the Styrian Alps to the confines of
Hungary, we describe along succession of marine strata; commencing,
as we have endeavoured to prove by the imbedded fossils, with rocks
                                                                       of

of the  Palaeotherian period, and ascending through the middle Sub
Apennine system to a large group of strata, apparently containing
several species of recent shells, and of the same age with the higher
deposits of the Vienna basin. Yet in this most recent group are masses
of limestone exhibiting so fine an oolitic structure, that by hand spe
cimens alone we should find it no easy task to separate them from- the
great oolite of Bath,
    In another section from north to south, we have shown the asso
ciation of the upper tertiary groups with the rugged volcanic rocks
which start out from the eastern plains of Styria: and from             the                              all
complicated phaenomena we conclude, that the volcanic forces were

     On the subject of tertiary deposits, I have finally to notice a com
  munication by Mr. Pratt, who found, during last summer, in the
  lower freshwater marls of Binstead in the Isle of Wight, many com
  minuted or rolled fragments of the bones and teeth of several species
 of Mammalia, mingled with pulverized shells, and with the bones of
 two or three species of freshwater turtles, resembling those described
 by M. Cuvier from the Paris basin. Among the more perfect speci
 mens of these fossils, the author found a tooth of the Anoplotherium
 commune, and the teeth of two species of Palaeotheria; thus confirm
 ing a previous discovery made known by Mr. Allen, and perfecting
 the zoological analogy between the newer lacustrine formations of
 England and central France.
    The bones of the Binstead marls do not however belong exclu
 sively to the order of Pachydermata; for the author also found the
jaws of a ruminating animal closely allied to the genus Moschus, but
 at the same time differing in some essential characters from every
 species hitherto described; and he gives us reason for sanguine hope,
 that large additions may be hereafter made to his very important list
 of new fossil quadrupeds. All the magnificent generalizations of
 Cuvier, as far as they are borne out by the zoological phaenomena of
 the Paris basin, apply therefore literally to the more recent physical
revolutions of our own country.
    Among the papers published in the early volumes of our Trans
actions, none excited a greater or more deserved interest than
those of Mr. Webster.      But first generalizations are almost always
pushed too far. After being bewildered with the observation of un
connected facts, the first glimmering of general truth is so delightful,
that it often leads us beyond the bounds of fair induction. We are then
compelled to retrace our steps, and cast about for new phaenomena;
and it is only after a succession of trials and adjustments, that the
facts we had at first partially misinterpreted are seen at their pro
per level, and with their true bearing upon each other. The broad
conclusions of Mr. Webster, in his comparison of the basins of Paris
and the Isle of Wight, are however too firmly established to be ever
shaken ; and it is only in his estimate of the subordinate groups that
his early essays require either revision or correction: and surely it
is no reproach to him that he did not foresee the subsequent disco
veries of MM. Cuvier and Brongniart.
   The argile plastique of Paris is now regarded as a mere local lacus
trine deposit. The plastic clay of this country             is,   on

    The form put on by a fluid body in rotation is an abstract ques
 tion, which might or might not have any real application to the
bodies of our solar system.      But direct geodesic observations, as
well as the relative  position of land and water, prove that the stra
tified matter on the crust of the earth is deposited in near confor
mity to the surface of a true spheroid of rotation. Here then we
have, in spite of one of the arbitrary dogmas of the Huttonian
theory, an indication of a primeval fluidity before the commence
ment of any one phaenomenon coming within the direct specu
lations of geology. And again, the direct phaenomena of geology
are in the strictest harmony with this conclusion. For, after passing
through a few stages of stratified matter, formed by the degradation
of matter in a prior state of solidity, we are conducted to other un
stratified masses with that crystalline structure which implies an
anterior fluidity—in some cases unequivocally, and in      cases pro                            all
bably, derived from the solvent power       heat.                  of

                                              sensible diurnal acceleration
during the last 2000 years; and therefore,            inverting the steps by                                       of

lapse of time, in the very contemplation of which our minds become
bewildered, the law of gravitation underwent no change, and the
powers of atomic combination were still performing their office.
   If the phaenomena of geology be coeval with long returning astro
nomical periods (and it is at least impossible to prove the contrary),
a question may arise, whether some of the first difficulties we meet
 with (such as those connected with the transport of diluvial gravel,
and the gradual diminution of temperature,) may not be attributed
rather to effects of planetary perturbation than to any change in the
internal condition of the earth. This question has been admirably
 discussed in a recent paper by Mr. Herschel.
    Of    all
           the secular inequalities produced      perturbation, those         by                                    of
 the moon alone can produce any visible effects upon the tidal level.
 The lunar inequalities considered are           two kinds—change            of                                     of
 mean distance, and change           eccentricity. Both are confined
                                                       of
 within narrow determined limits; and Mr. Herschel shows, by
 actual calculation, that they could not have produced any            the                                     of
 great movements contemplated          geology.

                of                                                obliquity                   of                    is

this but to limit the riches of the kingdoms of nature by the poverty
of our own knowledge; and to surrender ourselves to a mischie
vous, but not uncommon philosophical scepticism, which makes us
deny the reality of what we have not seen, and doubt the truth of
what we do not perfectly comprehend?
   Into the solution of the great problem of the heavenly bodies,
there enter only a few simple and unchangeable mechanical ele
ments, and the conclusions are of a simplicity corresponding to the
simplicity of the premises. All the celestial movements return into
themselves;    and even the most complex of the deviations pro
duced by mutual perturbation, are confined within narrow limits,
and are completed in secular periods. The solution of this problem
is incontestably the greatest triumph of exact science.   But with
what semblance of physical truth can we apply such mathematical
results as these to the great phaenomena of geology—where the com
binations are mutable and indefinite—where we have no vestige of
returning periods—and where the fixed elements of force are either
unknown or imperfectly comprehended ?

jects, indeed, are not yet touched upon by Mr. Lyell; and I throw
 out these remarks only to show by what difficulties the Huttonian
 hypothesis is encountered—of a kind, too, never present to the mind
of its inventor.                                                                  -
  There is however one chapter in the “Principles of Geology” where
the author combats the doctrine of the progressive development of
organic life, and briefly considers the distribution of fossil bodies in
the successive strata of the earth. I admit the general truth of his facts
and the strength of his argument, and I allow that he has succeeded
in exposing some of the errors and misstatements of his opponents.
A doctrine may however be abused, and yet contain many of the
elements of truth. With reference to the functions of the individual
being, one organic structure is as perfect as another.     But I think
that in the   repeated and almost entire   changes of organic types in
the successive formations of the earth—in the absence of mammalia
in the older, and their very rare appearance (and then in forms en
 tirely unknown to us) in the newer secondary groups—in the diffu
 sion of warm-blooded quadrupeds (frequently of unknown genera)
 through the older tertiary systems—in their great abundance (and
 frequently of known genera) in the upper portions of the same
 series—and, lastly, in the recent appearance of man on the surface
 of the earth (now universally admitted)—in one word, from all
 these facts combined, we have a series of proofs the most emphatic
 and convincing,-that the existing order of nature is not the last of
 an uninterrupted succession of mere physical events derived from
 laws now in daily operation: but on the contrary, that the ap
 proach to the present system of things has been gradual, and that
 there has been a progressive development of organic structure sub
 servient to the purposes of life.

the ages of the inclined and horizontal strata be defined, we also
necessarily define the period of the elevation.
  This kind of reasoning has for some years been familiar to the
f.
 eologists of Europe. Mr. Webster endeavoured to prove that the
     of Wight had been upset after the period of the London clay,
and before that of the lacustrine rock marl. Every one now admits,
(and indeed it is made the foundation of one of the classifications
of Mr. Conybeare,) that our carboniferous chains were elevated
before the period of the new red sandstone.
   But the researches of M. Elie de Beaumont, to which I now wish
to direct your attention, have given a vast extension to the obser
vations of all those who had gone before him.    And before I pro
ceed I cannot but lament that persons, who have not perhaps com
prehended the meaning of this admirable observer, should have
nibbled at the originality of his discoveries; as if the very essence
of philosophical discovery did not often consist in bringing to a
point              all
            the scattered lights       former observations, and giving

of breaks and fissures, one passing in the direction of the eastern;
and the other of the western portions of the chain. He further proves,
that the system of fissures in the line of the Eastern Alps is more
recent than the other system—that in the prolongation of this line
towards the west, the old diluvial gravel has undergone movements
of elevation—and that these movements have been propagated to the
lacustrine and volcanic regions of Auvergne.
   On a review of the whole evidence, I think he has demonstrated,
that there are two distinct deposits of diluvial gravel near a portion
of the Western Alps—that the colossal mass of Mont Blanc, and at
least a considerable portion of the Eastern Alps, were elevated after
the deposit of the older diluvium—and that the newer diluvium (in

 312                             Geological Society.
    Let me not, however, be misunderstood.                        I
                                                   have been offering no
 general criticism of Mr. Lyell's work: I have merely been arguing
 against the extension of one hypothetical principle (an important
 one indeed in the interpretation of geological phaenomena) on which
 we differ in opinion.    Nineteen twentieths of his work remain un
 touched by these remarks.      His excellent and original historic narra
 tive—his dignified philosophic views and clear descriptions—his ad
 mirable account of the effects brought about by the great causes,
 whether aqueous or igneous, now acting on the crust of the globe,
 contribute to make his volume, in the highest degree, both popular
 and instructive; and I cannot but express a wish, that, in the future
 editions of his work, the system of “geological dynamics” may be
stripped of even the semblance of hypothetical assumption; and that
having first ascertained by a mere appeal to facts, what the powers
 of nature now are (and I know no one more competent to the
task), he will then proceed to apply them to the solution of the
dark problems of geology. This arrangement would not only be the
most fair and logical, but would take away that controversial cha
racter, by which, in my opinion, some pages of his present volume are
disfigured; and would, in the end, give him incomparably the best
chance, either of limiting or extending his own principles, as might
seem good during the advances of our science. What he has written
with so much power, must inevitably produce a great impression on
the English school of geology. It is on this account, and not with any
spirit of unfriendly criticism, that I have discussed, at greater length
than   I first intended, the points on which we differ; and I am only
anxious, that a work abounding in so many admirable details, should
hereafter appear, as far as any human production can do, without a
blemish in the enunciation of a single principle.
    Greatly as I admire the generalizations of M. de Beaumont, they
have, I think, been already pushed too far. We may follow them as
our guides, but they must never take the place of direct observations.
It is only through limited regions of the earth that we shall perhaps be
ever able to make out the true parallels of contemporaneous elevation.
Distant continents may have independent parallel systems of eleva
tion. In several mountain chains (for example, in the Eastern Alps) we
have direct proof, that the forces of elevation have acted on the same
line at successive epochs; and in our island, there have been move
ments of elevation at different epochs, yet on lines which are parallel.
Lastly, lines of elevation (like the existing lines of modern volcanic
vent) may, in their prolongation, have deflected                        of far
                                                          from their first
direction.     But must forbear, for the discussion
                   I                                     these questions
would lead me into endless details”.

   At our former Anniversary I ventured to affirm, that our diluvial
gravel was probably not the result of one, but of many successive
periods. But what I then stated as a probable opinion, may, after the
Essays of M. de Beaumont, be now advanced with                   the authority                all                           of

in far different characters, that man is a recent sojourner on the sur
face of the earth.      Again, though we have not yet found the certain
traces of   any  great   diluvian catastrophe which we can affirm to be
within the human     period;   we have, at least, shown, that paroxysms of
internal  energy,  accompanied    by the elevation of mountain chains, and
followed   by mighty   waves   desolating whole regions of the earth, were
a part of the mechanism of mature. And what has happened, again
and again, from the most ancient, up to the most modern periods in
the natural history of the earth, may have happened once during the
few thousand years that man has been living on            surface. We have,                         its

   General Observations.—This      month was generally showery, with occa
sional gales of wind, and mild for the season, except the first five days.
   On the 1st instant, there were frequent falls of granulous snow mixed
with hail in the day,and three inches in depth fell in the night. The following
was also a snowy day, and the flakes were very large, loose, and moist,
amounting to three inches in depth.         Beyond York the snow about the
same time is said to have drifted in the roads above twenty feet in depth.
The maximum temperature of the external air for the twenty-four hours
occurred in the night of the 3rd, and nearly         the snow disappeared here              all
 by the following morning.     On the 9th, after       few showery and windy                   a

not surely be denied that any system, however unnatural,
however fanciful, arbitrary, or artificial it may be, provided
it enables an unassisted and uninstructed inquirer to arrange
and class and name in conformity with certain rules, any speci
men he may happen to meet with,<-confers no trivial boon on
the scientific world; and were                             I
                                       inclined to probe this part of
the   subject  very deeply,                   I
                                 think it would be found that in
some departments, at least, of science, an artificial arrangement
has an advantage over a natural system, for these reasons : —
   1st. That the very term Natural arrangement implies a pre
vious and thorough knowledge of the very subject with which
the inquirer is desirous of acquainting himself.
   2dly. That the very term Artificial arrangement implies a cer
tain latitude in the adoption of certain means to definite ends.
That this is a correct view of the case, the remarks of one of
our greatest supporters of natural to the exclusion of artificial
systems will tend to prove.         “An artificial system (says Mr.
MacLeay)* depends solely on observation, and may be said
even to require the exercise of no other faculty than that of
vision, having no other merit than the readiness and facility
with which it may enable an object to be named; whereas
the discovery of a natural system, being the work of an all
wise, all-powerful Deity+, can only be hoped for from a cau
tious process of inductive and analogical reasoning applied to
facts gathered from observation.” “The former,” he observes,
“ is the miserable resource of the feeble mind of man.” But
surely in making so severe a remark he ought injustice to have
added, that, as the latter is the plan of the creation itself, it
required the ken of Omnipotence itself to fathom and apply
it,and must assuredly operate               small impediment
                                                           as   no the                            in

ligible division into class, order, genus and species, was deemed
amply sufficient for        all
                             practical purposes; but those happy
days have long gone by, and these primary divisions can
scarcely     be traced under           an

cognisable under the division of the Danai candidi of Linnaeus
and the Clouded Yellows of Haworth forming part of that

modern and excessive refinements, little reliance can be placed
upon them. Superficial readers may not perhaps be aware
that most of the systems in Entomology, are made in great
measure to depend on a thorough knowledge of most
rate anatomical descriptions: “cujusque vel minimi discri
                                                                  ..
minis diligentissima observatio”,” the essential points depend
ing, as in the case of Fabricius, upon such minute parts of the
mouths of insects as are not visible without a compound mi
croscope, and even then not without the most careful dissec
tion by a skilful and accustomed hand.
   But there are multitudes of cases in which all this skill and
care and microscopic observation must go unrewarded. Take
as an example the first entomological plate given in Swain
son's valuable Zoological Illustrations, Colias Statira.           Ex
perienced naturalists need not be informed that the palpi of
the Papilionidae are looked upon as features of great authority
in the subdivisions of the tribe; and consequently on turning
to Godart+, who with some trifling variations adopts the sy
stem  of Cuvier and Latreille, we find the palpi occupying the
first place in ascertaining      the generic character, and thus
mentioned — “Genus Colias — Palpes inferieurs tres-com
primés; leur dernier article beaucoup moins long que le pré
cédent.”     In strict conformity with these and other equally
good authorities Mr. Swainson commences the generic cha
racter of the Colias, with Palpi breves. But on reading his de
scription of this very first illustration of the genus; what do
we find—what, but that the last joints of these palpi are extra
ordinarily prolonged!, and that a similar prolongation is the
characteristic distinction of the Colias Drya of Fabricius, a to
tally different insect. Well may he, in stating candidly (with
out blinking the difficulty) that this prolongation of a promi
nent generic feature is at variance with the generic character
of the Colias,—add with equal candour, that this is a striking
proof that in a natural system, no single part can be taken as
an unerring criterion for generic distinction, without making
it eventually an artificial one. Again; in speaking of the
Ismene OEdipodea he remarks, that although the perfect insect
possesses striking and peculiar generic characters, neither the
caterpillar nor chrysalis appears to differ from others of this
family of Papilionidae, adding, that this is one of the many
facts which prove the impossibility of making the larvae a
primary consideration in forming the genera of Lepidoptera.
It may be further observed, by the by, that here, as well as in
some other instances, the dissection of the mouth was omitted,

for fear of destroying the specimen;–a very natural remark
to make, and obviously applicable in nine cases out of ten,
where of course the captor of a rare or to him unknown in
sect, would hesitate in destroying a specimen which he might
not easily, if ever, have an opportunity of replacing.
   We need not be surprised to find, when contending with
these obscure and vague distinctions, that the most experi
enced entomologists are themselves bewildered; and conse
quently, in the arrangement of their cabinets and catalogues are
not unfrequently in the habit of inserting the same insect under
different genera or divisions. Sometimes it is a Bombyr, then a
Noctua, then a Geometra, or a Phalaena, or some other minor
subclassified title, according to the ever varying or vexatiously
indeterminate state of scientific arrangement.—My last, but

be difficult to collect the shadow of an assignable cause for
 the given cognomen.        Of the remaining four, Papilio may
be said to be rather a     generally comprehensive term for the
 whole set, than a generic distinction for a twentieth part.
 For the 2nd, Gonopteryx, there is a decided and intelligible
meaning in the angular character of the posterior wing. Of the
 5th, Leucophasia, it may be observed that it is an intruder of
very recent date, a scion separated from the genus Pontia by
 Mr. Stephens, with an apology stating that it is not without
reluctance he adds another generic name to the almost               in
finite number with which the pages of entomological works
are already filled.    With the 18th, Polyommatus, we have no
other   complaint  to find, than a regret that the old and more
generally intelligible Linnaean term multipunctatae was not ad
hered to.
    Much very much more remains to be said, but I fear that
I  may already have said too much,-too much, not to ex
pose these remarks to the reprehension of my brethren far
advanced in the flights of science. Too much, to induce             in
cipient entomologists to venture further on a study, whose
real characters may be found, when further cultivated, to be
repulsive or inscrutable.     Most truly has the Secretary of the
Linnaean Society expressed himself in saying, that “in no de
partment in natural history are the inconveniences arising
out of the confusion of analysis and synthesis more felt than
in Entomology, it being worse furnished with skilful arrange
ment, owing to attempts which have been made to combine
the natural with the artificial systems.”    The result, he truly
adds, will finally be, that instead of making Natural History
familiar and popular, it will require the compass of a man's
life to master the terms we employ.

    L.  On the recent Change of Form of the Summit of Mont
               Blanc.    By A CorrespondENT.
THE       pyramid which was erected on the summit of Mont
      Blanc in 1811, by order of Napoleon, has been described
as a cross, not only by Mr. Auldjo, but also by Dr. Clark and
Captain Sherwill in their account of their ascent in 1825.
The fact  is,that the cross was simple pyramid,

were charged to fix the pyramid on the summit.      The posts
were of a  species of Pinus called Meléze, which grows in the
Alps at the height of nearly             thousand feet, and wasseven
therefore considered more likely to withstand the destructive
force and change of climate on Mont Blanc. They were se
lected from the forest of La Blaitière, fashioned at Chamouni,
and carried the first day by six men as far as the rocks called
the Grands Mulets, nine thousand nine hundred feet above the
level of the sea. The second day these indefatigable moun
taineers arrived at the summit with their ponderous load; and
having excavated a hole in the ice six feet deep, the pyramid
was planted; but       elevation above the surface being only six

       well known to geologists, that the oolites, that series
            which, in England, intervenes between the new
red sandstone and the chalk,-are almost entirely wanting in
Ireland. The only members of the formation which exist
there, are the lias and the mulatto or green-sand, and these
occupy but a very limited extent of surface. They appear in
the escarpment of the great basaltic area, which comprehends
all Antrim and half      Derry. Encircling

one   or  two exceptions, always underlies the basalt. The
mulatto   generally   accompanies          but the lias  it;  frequently               is

no more of comparative anatomy than enabled me to compre

the form of these lines, which are generally, no doubt, per
pendicular to the direction of the current, from the want of
means to determine the time of high water at sea. The times
in the map are intended to be Greenwich time; the extent, how
ever, included by the map, and the scale, are so small, that the
differences between the Greenwich time and the time at the
place, in the present state of our information is of little con
sequence.

North as far as 38°, nearly, and South as far as 85°, where the

 LV.          Observations relative to the Origin and History of the

 FOR  subsistence, the Bushmen, as has already been observed,
   trust principally to the fruits of the earth, and to the game
  which their plains afford: but when either of those are found
 deficient, few have any hesitation in supplying their wants from
 the flocks of the neighbouring farmers.                 With even such a
 variety of resources, they are nevertheless often sufferers from
 extreme want, and are thereby necessitated to consume almost
 every article which is to be found within the range of their
 retreats.     Of the vegetable productions, many roots, both
 fibrous, fleshy, and bulbous, form articles of their food; and
 of berries and other fruits, they employ almost                that are met             all

340         Dr. A. Smith's   Observations relative to the
it is used, yet it is often, either from choice or necessity occa
sioned by a want of water, swallowed as it flows from the body.
The skins, at least of the larger animals, are not even rejected,
and those they often feed upon with a degree of rapacity,
which nothing but extreme hunger would support.
   Some of the articles just stated are regularly made use of
in their natural state, but the majority only when cooked. The
vegetable productions that require such preparation, are either
boiled or roasted; and those belonging to the animal kingdom
are mostly treated in the latter way, with the exception of grass
hoppers, larvae of ants, and ostrich eggs, which are commonly
consumed without being submitted to the influence of cooking;
all the others are, when choice can be exercised, more or less
prepared; and what requires most labour, is the dried skins
of the larger animals. Those are first moistened by water,
and then stamped and roasted; or else roasted first, and
stamped afterwards.     Though the employment of articles like
the last mentioned is calculated to create a degree of wonder
in those who have never suffered severely from the pangs of
want, yet how much more adapted for such a purpose is the
observance of a fact, which almost daily occurs amongst the
Bushmen, namely, the preparation of pieces of old shoes, &c.
for the purpose of furnishing a scanty and tasteless meal.
   The vegetable products are principally obtained without
much labour; and if we except the different roots, few require
much exertion.     The latter it is necessary to dig out of the
ground, and for that purpose they employ either a piece of
pointed wood hardened by having been previously a little
burnt, or else a gemsbok horn, and by either of those they
loosen the surrounding soil with amazing rapidity. . The ani
mal productions are partly procured without much trouble,
but, the majority not without very considerable exertion, as
well as the exercise of no small degree of dexterity and cun
ning. The bow and arrow are the means upon which they
mostly rely for obtaining the latter; and next to those, snares
and dogs.    In employing the former, they either endeavour to
approach the animal within a suitable distance to wound him
severely, or else to conceal themselves so as to be in the way
as he may be pursuing his progress, or, lastly, by the practice

    that, they are not unfrequently disappointed of the objects in
    view.     When, however, they are successful, they carry the
    fruits thereof to their temporary residence, and there, by the
    assistance of a small piece of dried skin, remove all the earth
    and other impurities, after which they either devour the re
    mainder, or else place them in a pot upon the fire and warm
    it a little; during which time they keep agitating the contents,
    so as to prevent them from burning, &c. After a few minutes
    of such treatment, they are considered as prepared and adapted
    for food. In this state they are not unpalatable, and it is only
    the knowledge of their nature that gives anything like a dis
    inclination to relish them.
       By the Bushmen, the food under consideration is highly
    esteemed, and that and the ostrich egg are perhaps the most
    admired articles of their subsistence.     After what has been
    stated as to the variety of articles employed in diet, it will
    doubtless appear a little strange, that on many occasions they
    are scarcely able to exist.    Such evidently arises from the
    scantiness with which the varieties alluded to are distributed,
    particularly at certain seasons, as well as from the difficulty
    with which many of them are obtained. It matters little, how
    ever, what the cause or causes are, as the fact is established,
    and is what doubtless induces them to plunder both the colo
    mists and their various Hottentot neighbours.       Lest, how
    ever, this remark should be construed as expressing my be
    lief, that unavoidable want is the only incentive to plunder,               I
    may observe, that       I
                           am quite convinced that laziness and a
    love of animal food are very often what alone urge them to
    thieving.               [To be continued.]

ganic remains. The thousands of extinct animals and plants, which
fill the dark mansions of the earth, yield to the geologist as sure a
record of the revolutions by which our planet, after it had become a
mass of mere mineral matter, was prepared for the habitation of man,
as the mummy and the pyramid, the coin and the urn, the inscription
and the column, declare the subsequent vicissitudes of human society.
By announcing, forty years since, the important fact that each suite
of analogous strata, the result of a peculiar set of natural operations,
—contains a peculiar suite of organic reliquiae, derived from the beings
then living in the waters, or transported thither from the land, and
consequently that the different fossil species of plants, corals, shells,
and vertebrated remains, belong to different epochs, and mark the
successive periods of the earth's formation, Mr. W. Smith changed
entirely the whole face of geological science. His principles, success
fully applied to determine the stratification of England, received a
splendid confirmation from the researches of Cuvier and Brongniart
in France, and are at this moment universally admitted as the basis
of the laborious researches by which Buckland, Sedgwick, Murchison,
Lyell, De Beaumont, Von Buch, Voltz, Dufresnoy, Deshayes, Necker,
Brocchi, and others, have established the general accordance with
each other of the stratified deposits of Europe, and the existence of
more or less perfectly analogous deposits over            the world.             all

     The organic     reliquiae of the Yorkshire coast have been for a long
time    celebrated;      and the most distinguished geologists of England
have    employed     themselves in investigating the relations of the strata,
there    exposed    in the sea cliffs and inland ranges of hills. But though
in these researches a certain part of the history of the strata was de
termined, and represented on Mr. Smith's and Mr. Greenough's maps,
and described by Messrs. Conybeare and Sedgwick, still the whole
district was most imperfectly known, and the oolitic series in parti
cular was not at                all

     On comparing this section and the enlarged descriptions of the
 lias and oolitic formations of Yorkshire with that of the vicinity of
 Bath, we obtain the following important conclusions:
     1st. That the calcareous portion of the lias of Yorkshire is much
 less decidedly accumulated into solid limestone rock than about
 Bath, and in this respect the Lincolnshire lias possesses an interme
 diate character.
     2dly. That the marlstone beds, which, though well distinguished by
 Smith, seldom appear in much force near Bath, and then only twenty
 feet below the sand of the inferior oolite, are in Rutlandshire buried
 one hundred feet below that rock, and are covered in Yorkshire by a
 thickness of two hundred feet of alum shale.
     3dly. That the yellow or brown sand and sandstone, which near
 Bath separates the inferior oolite from the lias, is continuous through
 the counties of Rutland and Lincoln into Yorkshire, where it is
 scarcely accompanied by any trace of oolite.
     4thly. That instead of the shelly calcareo-argillaceous                    series
  (Fullers-earth beds, Smith) of beds which divides the Bath oolite into
 great or upper and lower, or ferruginous oolite, the Yorkshire hills
 contain fully five hundred feet of sandstone and shale with a vast va
 riety of fossil plants, and thin seams of coal; and that between the
 great oolite and the cornbrash, a similar interposition of sandstone
 shale and coal-plants is repeated. The Bath oolite formation is
  therefore in Yorkshire a true coal-field, and must never be left out of
 consideration in any speculations on the origin of coal seams.
     Mr. Murchison's researches in Sutherland show how far northward
 this coal-field reaches, and there are several similar examples in Gers
                                                                               many ;

thicken towards   Lincolnshire,  the sandstone and shale are attenuated.

strong shells of Turbo littoreus, Purpura lapillus, and Buccinum un
datum, we have Mya arenaria, Tellina solidula and tenuis, Mactra
subtruncata ? Cardium edule”, and a shell which appears to me to
be Crassina scotica. The shells are most abundant along particular
layers in the gravel.   The mass descends to a great depth, and is
found beneath the  adjacent  marsh-land, which consists of fine clay,
lying upon peat and trees, and is part of an extended level tract,
reaching from the Humber near Pattrington, almost to the sea, at
Sandley mere. It seems to have been, at some former period, a
channel for some vast volume of water; for it winds as other valleys
do, and the gravel hills which bound it are abrupt on the concave
side, and slope gently down on the other.”                            -

  “The    lakes, which were left on the retiring of the diluvial currents,
appear to have been continually diminished in depth, and contracted
in extent, by deposits of vegetable matter, decayed shells, and sedi
ment, brought into them by land-floods.      In this manner a surprising
number of inland lakes have been extinguished in Holderness, and
nothing remains to denote their former existence, but the deposits
by which they have been filled.”
   “All the lacustrine deposits containing peat, which have inspect          I
ed in Holderness, agree in this general fact, that the peat does not
rest immediately upon the diluvial formation beneath, but is sepa
rated from it by at least one layer of sediment, which is seldom with
out shells. The peat is very generally confined to a single layer,

     The co-efficient of the equation depending on the moon's distance
from the sun, affords the means                                    of calculating the sun's horizontal
parallax. For this purpose Laplace has computed this co-efficient
with greater accuracy than the rest; and he makes the sun's parallax
nearly 9". The author's theory gives it little more than 8"#, which
is very near the mean of the various results obtained by the obser

lected a large block of granite in the southern pier of the entrance
to the boat basin.    He then caused a block of gun metal, cast for
the purpose, two inches and a half square and eight inches long, to
be sunk in the centre of the granite, about an inch below the sur
face, thereby allowing a brass box and cover to be placed over the
standard to protect it from injury.     In order that there might be a
sufficient      number        of checks to the permanence of this standard
mark, the author caused others to be placed in the yard; namely,
one near the southern extremity on the wall of the Dock Yard, one
at the eastern side of the great basin, and one in a large block of
stone resting on the brick-work of the navy wall. As a further
means of future verification of this standard level, he had a very
large block of granite placed on a slight eminence, two miles and a
half to the southward of the Dock Yard, on which there formerly
stood the old castle of Queenborough.     One of the brass standards
being let into the granite, the place was covered over, but marked
by a small mound of earth near         that   may easily it,   so

Professor Struve.                                                 -
   Professor Struve observes, that “even with such a powerful
telescope as the Dorpat refractor, it is not easy to observe the
emersion of faint stars from the moon's bright limb.   But the mi
crometer, with the clock-work horary motion, affords a very satis
factory method of measuring the distance of a star, after emersion
from the enlightened disc. These observations replace a lost emer
sion, and have even this advantage over an emersion exactly ob
served—that they do not depend upon the inequalities of the edge
of the moon. Such micrometrical measures, both at immersion
and emersion, will be found in the accompanying occultations of
the Hyades.     An accurate computation will show what degree of
accuracy may be expected from this mode of observing, and if there
be a constant error in the apparent diameter of the moon depending
upon the telescope employed.       These measurements are, however,
very difficult, and,   should    I
                                think, better adapted to Fraunhofer's
heliometer than to the wire micrometer.”
   The telescopes were variously adjusted, upon close double stars,
upon Aldebaran, and upon the moon; but though there were four or
more observers, in no instance was any projection seen. The dis
appearances took place instantaneously, when the apparent centre
of the star entered upon the edge of the moon, and the re-appear
ances were also instantaneous; neither was there any previous varia
tion in the brilliance of the star.

   In the first of these notes Mr. Lubbock has deduced the elements
 ofthe orbit    this comet from Messier's observations, adopting the
                  of
value  of the semiaxis major given         M.                by
                                                  Pontécoulant, and the   de

moiseau.    The elements thus obtained satisfy, with considerable
exactness, Messier's observations from Jan. 22         June         seen        to           3,   as
                                                                                                  is

   Mr. Lubbock then briefly explains the mode         which these ele                       by

   In the second note, Mr. Lubbock analyses       very valuable paper                  a
upon the same subject,                       by
                           M. Rosenberger, contained       the Astron.                               in
Nach. Nos. 180 and 181.
  M. Rosenberger first obtained approximate elements from five                                                      of
Messier's observations, adopting the semiaxis major       Damoiseau.                                 of
He then calculated the effect  produced    upon  the elements by the
perturbations             of
                  the seven large planets,  for every  ten days, from
the        January
            of                        May 1759. With the corrected

corrected by Bessel, having regard both            precession and nuta            to
tion. These    computed    places   were   carefully  compared with the
observed places.   The   positions                           of
                                        the stars with which the comet
was compared were taken, when possible, from the Fundamenta
Astronomiae,          or
                Piazzi's Catalogue.      When these were wanting, the
Histoire Céleste and Bessel's Zones were resorted to, and many
stars were determined                         by
                               Professor Bessel for this purpose.                                                  In
reducing the observations, parallax and the differences        refraction                             of
were taken into account.                          Finally,        all
                                                              the observations which could
be depended upon, those                       of   Messier, Maraldi, Cassini, Bradley, Hell,
and Darquier, were combined and made use                  the method                   of       by                  of
least squares.     The elements resulting from this comparison are
compared with Messier's observations, and the differences            not                                     do
exceed half      minute
                   a        space.  Mr. Lubbock finds the differences

 1, 2, 4. The common difference in the palatal, the coronal, the
 basilar, and the extreme length of the cranium, is the breadth of
 the cranium at the temporal fossae: these lengths, in the animal
examined, being, respectively, 12, 15, 18, 21 inches. The lateral
 extent of the atlas is equal to the distance between the inner mar
 gins of the orbits. The greatest elevation of the spine is at the
 third dorsal vertebra; the extreme length of that bone equalling
the greatest extent of the pelvis towards the mesial plane. The
longest of the twelve ribs are the seventh and the eighth; their
length equals the greatest extent of the scapula.     The sum of the
lengths of the twelve ribs is about ten times that of the longest
rib. The dimensions of the cavity of the chest agree with those of the
separate bones of the body; thus, the greatest width of the chest
is equal to the greatest length of the head. The breadths of the
pelvis, rostrad, (measured towards the front), from the acetabula, are
even numbers of proportional parts. The breadths, caudad, (mea
sured towards the tail), from the acetabula, including the acetabular
breadth itself, are odd numbers of proportional parts.     The chief
dimensions of the pelvis are identical with the chief dimensions of
the head; thus, for example, the greatest dimension of the pelvis,
being through the mesial plane, is equal to the greatest length of
the head.   The lengths of the four long bones of the atlantal (fore)
limbs, independent of processes and elevations, are consecutively
as the numbers 22, 28, 20, 6,-sum 76. The similar lengths of the
four long bones of the sacral (hind) limbs are consecutively as the
numbers 28, 23, 20, 5,-sum 76. The author observes, in conclu
sion,     that, from   the exposition given in the paper       it appears that
 throughout the dimensions of the bones of the Bactrian Camel
 there is such an agreement, that many of the dimensions are con
 tinued proportionals,    and that the mutual relations of nearly all
 admit of a very simple expression; and he states that correspond
ing relations have been found to prevail in the bones of every species
of animal he has examined. From the full verification of these ob
servations in the osteology of other animals, it will result, he infers,
that zoology is susceptible of a classification established on the
fixed basis of number, that the tissues by which the bones are
moulded are also of determinable proportions, and that, conse
quently, the development of the parts of organized bodies, &c. &c.
afford a wide scope for numerical as well as for physiological in

         A specimen was exhibited of a young Nyl-ghau, (Antilope picta,
       Pall,) which was born at the Society's Farm in January last. The
       mother of this individual had borne two young about twelve months
      since, while in the possession of His late Majesty. On the present
       occasion she had also borne two, one of which is still living. The
      differences between the young and the adult animal were pointed
       out. The latter is well known. The former is generally of a dull
      reddish fawn colour, which is brighter on the lower part of the legs,

      Statura At. atri, F. Cuv.
   By the white patch on the forehead and the radiation of the hair
from the back of the neck, this monkey approaches the At. hybridus,
described in the ‘Dictionnaire Classique d'Histoire Naturelle,' by
M. Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. In the latter, however, the co
lours of the body are varied and generally light, the darkest tint
which is mentioned as occurring on the specimen described being
the pure brown of the head and anterior limbs. In the Society's
individual, on the contrary, the whole of the hairs, with the excep
tion of the frontal patch, are jet black: the naked parts of the skin
are also black, except a flesh-coloured space on the face including
the eyes, nose, and lips. It has been suspected that as the lighter
coloured species of Ateles advance in age they acquire the black
which is so generally prevalent in the group; but this change of
 colour yet remains to be proved.
   Some notes by Mr. Yarrell of an examination of the body of the
lesser American Flying-Squirrel, (Pteromys volucella, Cuv.,) were
 read. The individual examined had lived in the Society's Collec
tion for upwards of a year.
   The pectoral muscles, and also the muscles of          the limbs were          all
 well marked and      large size; the clavicles perfect; and the general

on inflating these, the whole substance rose and became turgid, ap
pearing to be little else than a receptacle for venous blood.

one of which lies in the mesial line behind and below the heart. This
single lobe, which is very general in the Mammalia, has consider
able analogy with the lobulus Spigelii of the liver.
   “The heart is oblong, with a round obtuse aper. The left
brachial vein joins the superior cava; the arch of the aorta gives off
the two carotid arteries and the right brachial by a common trunk,
then the left brachial artery.
   “The rings of the trachea are regular and of uniform size,                                     in
complete behind, in number thirty-six.       The arytenoid cartilages
have thin elevated   apices.   The sides of the epiglottis extend back
wards as far as the cricoid   cartilage, and it arches over the rima
glottidis like a penthouse or shed. The thyroid gland consists of
detached lobes lying below the larynx, in the interspace of the aeso
phagus and trachea.
   “ The tongue measures one inch and eight lines; it becomes
gradually thinner to the tip, which is neatly rounded.       The horny
papillae are principally collected in three groups, one near the apex,
and one on either side near the middle of the tongue.
   “The aesophagus has longitudinal rugae internally.
   “ The parts of generation showed, by their vascular condition,
evident traces of recent excitement: this individual, indeed, had
been observed to receive the advances of the male a short time pre
vious to her death; but there was no visible proof of impregnation
having taken place. The vagina had longitudinal rugae on        inner                      its
aspect; the urethra opened close    the external aperture, within
                                                 to                                               a

 were of a dark livid colour, and in a state almost approaching to
 hepatization.   Hurried and impeded respiration was the principal
 symptom noticed before death. The stomach and small intestines
 betrayed traces of inordinate vascular action.
    “ In the structure of the alimentary canal, especially of the
 cacum, and in the remarkable shortness of the large intestines, this
 animal has a close affinity with the Civet and Genette, as well as in
 the structure of the kidneys as before mentioned. The inferior sur
 face of the tarsus is destitute of hair, as in many of the Viverridae,
in the true plantigrade Mammalia, and in the Kangaroo; like the
latter animal, the Suricate is in the habit of assuming the upright
position, resting on the tarsus. It is carnivorous, and while in con
finement, manifested great agitation at the sight of small birds.”
   In conclusion, Mr. Owen remarked, that the appearances which
he had noticed, agreed with the description of the viscera of the ani
mal, as recorded by Daubenton, so far as that distinguished com
parative anatomist had observed them.
  The Chairman exhibited a collection  of Birds which had been
made in the islandof Mauritius by Mr. Telfair, an active and well
known Corresponding Member of the Society. They had been
consigned to Mr. Barclay of Bury Hill in Surrey, who had pre
sented them to the Society.   Several species were of interest, as
being confined to the island and       immediate vicinity, and being

   This bird also was observed to be closely allied to the last, and
to differ from it probably only in sex or age. Until such points
however could be ascertained, it was considered advisable to regard
it as specifically distinct.
   Another interesting modification of form was exhibited among the
 Shrikes, in which the forked tail, acuminated wing, and short and
feeble legs of the birds allied to Dicrurus appeared united to the
head and bill of some of the Stares, particularly the genus Pastor.
Mr.Vigors characterized the form under the generic name of

   Various Birds of Mauritius have been brought before the Society,
including the Fulica Chloropus, L.; the Numenius Madagascariensis,
Briss.; and a Snipe, known in the island as the Cul blanc. To the
latter M.L. Desjardins has given, with some doubts, the name of Sco
lopar Mauritiana.
   Several birds from Madagascar have also occupied the attention of
the Society, and M. J. Desjardins has identified them as follows: two
species of Falco, Cuv.; Strir flammea, L.; Loria Madagascariensis,
L.; Corvus Dauricus, Lath. ; a species of Regulus, Cuv.; Cuculus
canorus, L.; Tetrao Coturnir, L.; Scopus Umbretta; Rallus Mada
gascariensis, n. s. ; Fulica Chloropus, L.; Fulica cristata, Gmel. ;
Scolopar Capensis, L.; Colymbus minor, L.; and four species of the
genus Anas, L.
   There are very few Reptiles met with on the island. An instance
has occurred of the discovery of a living Snake, the second within
the memory of the inhabitants.       It was the Coluber rufus, LaCép.;
and had probably been brought from India in some ship. The earlier
travellers speak of the existence of Tortoises, but none are now found.
M.    J.Desjardins has, however, discovered three deposits of the re
mains of these animals,                   all
                                   which are evidently
                                                of         modern date,               of
their  age  not  exceeding  two                      or
                                      three centuries.   There are two
Saurian Reptiles, which, although common, remained undescribed
until M.      Desjardins gave
               L.                 them the namesto      Scincus Telfairii        of

it to zoologists to determine whether it be marine, terrestrial, or

               the previous details the author draws             series      con   a               of
clusions, and shows:
    1st. That the region described            the paper, forms
                                                     in              connecting         a
link between the northern and southern ends of the carboniferous
chain   ; and that the carbonaceous deposits are gradually more and
more interlaced with the limestone             the range towards the north.
                                                         in
   2ndly. That many                  of
                               the coal-beds   alternating  with the mountain
limestone must have been deposited                 the waters in       deep sea;        of   a
that        no
          fresh-water shells     appear   associated with the fossils       these                  of
beds; and that the highest part                      of
                                              the Yorkshire coal-fields was

tens and Ammonites are there found associated with fresh-water
genera.
*
   3rdly. That, with limited exceptions, the same species                  fossils                of
                     in

                     all         limestone; but wherever there
                                          of                              change              is  a

of mineral character, that there we may remark an equally sudden
change in the fossil species.     Thus the vegetable impressions
abounding in the sandstone and shale are not found in the lime
stone; on the contrary, the corallines, encrinites, &c. of the lime
stone, with rare exceptions, do not occur in the shale or sandstone
beds.
   4thly. That the beds of limestone appear to have been formed by
a slow and tranquil deposit, assisted by the action of organic bodies,
which lived and died on the spots where they are now found; that
on the contrary, the beds of shale and sandstone appear to have
been formed mechanically, and contain fossils drifted from a                                 di
stance. Hence these beds are less continuous and regular than the
groups of limestone; but some of them, especially two of the coal
beds, may be traced through the greater part of the several lines of
Section.
   5thly. That the valleys of the carboniferous chain, near the lines
of section, are not excavated on lines of fault, but on true valleys
of denudation.    Notwithstanding this, there has been some change
in the distribution of the water channels, at a period very recent,
compared with that of the elevation of the carboniferous chain—just
before the deposit of the new red sandstone.

            Jan. 21.-Mr.         Faraday on a peculiar class of Optical Deceptions.
      —These deceptions depend principally upon the general   effect produced
     upon the eye when two or more bodies are presented in such rapid
     succession to it as to produce no distinct impression for each, but pro
     duce a general impression often very clear and distinct in appearance,
     but entirely unlike the real appearance of the active bodies. Thus, if
     two equal cog-wheels be placed one before the other, and put in rapid
     motion in opposite directions but with equal velocities, a spectral
     fixed cog-wheel will appear; although if either cog-wheel be looked
     at alone, nothing but a plain uniform tint, corresponding to the place
     of the cogs will be seen. The various deceptions depending upon this
     effect were traced and illustrated, and it appears that many of them
     are of common occurrence.
         In the Library numerous. Wheel-animalculae were exhibited by
     powerful microscopes belonging to Cuthbert and Varley, for the pur
     pose of illustrating the appearances, which were referred to the class
     of deceptions above spoken                  of.                                -

                CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL          SOCIETY.
 “A     meeting of this Society was held on Monday evening, Fe
 bruary 21, Dr. F. Thackeray, the Treasurer, in the chair. Various
 books were presented to the Society, among which were three
 volumes of the Correspondance Mathematique et Physique, pub
 lished by M. Quetelet, of Brussels, and presented by him; Dr.
 Morton's Travels in Russia, from the author, and a Russian Dic
 tionary presented by the same gentleman; Mr. Jones's new work On
 the distribution of Wealth, from the author; The second edition
 of the first volume of the Translation of Niebuhr, from the transla
 tors.   The following presents to the museum were also announced:
 —several skins of birds and a collection of insects from China,
 presented by the Rev. G. Vachell; a collection of foreign insects,
 by J. G. Children, Esq.; and two specimens of Charr from Wales,
 by W. Yarrell, Esq. A Daniell's hygrometer was presented by
 R. W. Rothman, Esq. Fellow of Trinity College. W. Swainson,
 Esq. well known as an ornithologist, was elected an honorary mem
 ber.—A paper was read by Professor Airy, “On the nature of the
 rays formed by the double refraction of quartz;” of which the fol
 lowing is an abstract     :-
    It is well known to those who have followed the recent discoveries
 respecting the properties of light, that the phaenomena exhibited
 by quartz are very different from those of any other substance of
 similar crystalline character—as for instance, calc spar. Thus, when
 exposed to plane-polarized light, a plate of calc spar exhibits a
 series of rings, of which the colours commence from Newton's black
 at the centre; and these rings are intersected by a black cross:
—quartz, on the other hand, displays a series of rings, the central
point of which exhibits a colour different according to the thickness
 of the plate: there is no cross, but at a distance from the centre,
 rudiments of black brushes begin to appear. Again, in the case of
calc spar, on turning the analysing plate, the rings change in colour,
but are always circular, and of unchanged dimensions.         On turning
the   analysing  plate  in the experiment with quartz, the rings  become
square figures, with a curious defect of symmetry, and dilate or
contract continually. If we put together a plate of right-handed
and a plate of left-handed quartz in the same apparatus, we obtain
a most singular and beautiful appearance, consisting of four co
loured spirals cutting a number of concentric circles.
    On exposing these substances respectively to light circularly
polarized, the appearances are still more remarkable: calc spar ex
hibits rings dislocated at each quadrant, with a gray cross; while
the colours in quartz are seen in the form of two spirals inwrapping
each other, with no black or gray cross.
    Professor Airy, after describing these phaenomena, the most
striking of which are new, proceeds to state and develop the hy
           -
                                                                 pothesis

                  Cambridge Philosophical       Society.              383
pothesis which they have suggested to him; of which the main
point is this: that the two rays in quartz are elliptically-polarized,
 one to the right, the other to the left; the major axes of the ellipses
being respectively in and perpendicular to the principal plane. Cal.
culations founded on this supposition represent with a very close
agreement,     the   various  and  complex    phaenomena     which   have
been noticed; and, what is more remarkable still, they not only
coincide in the general facts, but lead also to deviations from sym
metry, such as are observed to exist in the figures.
    After the meeting, Professor Airy exhibited, 1st, A model to       il
lustrate Fresnel's idea, that circularly-polarized light is formed from
plane-polarized (when the plane of polarization is inclined 45° to
that of total internal reflexion), by retarding the undulations per
pendicular to the plane of reflexion by one quarter of an undu
lation; and that double such a retardation shifts the plane of po
larization 90°;—which was also shown to be the fact with Fresnel's
rhomb.
    2d, A new polarizing machine: the advantages of which are;—
that complete rings may be seen with a very small specimen: that
by placing the specimen in another position, the macled structure
may be very well seen : that circularly-polarized light may be used
 .  well as plane; and that lamp-light may be used as well as day
  ight.
   *.   An attempt to exhibit the coloured rings by the light of
heated lime; which succeeded so far as to show the practicability
of this application.
    March 7–The Very Reverend the Dean of Peterborough, the
President, in the chair.—The following presents were laid on the
table: A pair of the Scaup Duck (Fuligula Marila), by the Hon.
Richard Neville; An egg of the Cayman, presented by Dr. Jermyn;
and an egg of the Great Bustard, found in Cambridgeshire,            pre
sented   by Mr. Barron. A    paper  was read   by R. Murphy,    Esq.  Fel
low of Caius College, “On the general solution of equations.” After
the meeting, the Rev. R. Willis, of Caius College, exhibited a num
ber of experiments on the transverse and longitudinal vibrations of
strings, membranes, and solid bodies, illustrative of the recent re
searches and discoveries of M. Savart.
    March 21. — Dr. F. Thackeray, the Treasurer, in the chair.
A paper by Mr. Miller, of St. John's College, was read, “On the
elimination of the time from the differential equations of the motion
of a point, acted upon by a central force, and affected by disturb
 ing forces, or by the resistance of a medium.” A paper, by the
same gentleman,     was also read, containing     Determinations   of the
form and measurements of the angles of several artificial crystals;
viz. sulphuret of nickel, borate of potash, nitrate of ammonia, car
bazotic acid, carbazotate of potash, benzoic acid, nitrate of silver
and ammonia, and sulphate of copper and ammonia.              The latter
compound     appears, by comparison     with the measurements     of Mr.
Brooke, to be isomorphous or plesiomorphous with respect to
various other double sulphates; viz. the sulphates of ammonia and
                                                               magnesia,

magnesia, of nickel and potash, of nickel and zinc, of potash and
magnesia, and of copper and potash.-After the meeting, Mr.Willis
exhibited a machine constructed for the purpose of illustrating the
motions of the particles of a fluid in which undulations of various
kinds are singly or jointly propagated.
   April 18.—The very Rev. the Dean of Peterborough, the Pre
sident, in the chair.      The first part of a paper by Professor
Whewell was read, containing A mathematical exposition of some
of the leading doctrines of Mr. Ricardo's “Principles of Political
Economy and Taxation.” There was also read, by Professor Airy,
A description of an apparatus constructed under his direction, and
of the properties of elliptically-polarized light exhibited by means
of it; it was stated that the phaenomena had been found to agree
in the most precise manner with the results previously obtained by
calculation.—After the meeting, Professor Henslow exhibited a
number of the appearances of what have been called “spectral
wheels,” produced by the rotation of two wheels, one behind the
other.                                                                             -

WEchester,
    have been favoured by an esteemed correspondent at Man
           with some extracts from the Manchester Chronicle
and Manchester Guardian newspapers, of April 16th, respecting
the giving way of a suspension bridge over the river Irwell, at
Broughton, about two miles from Manchester.        Our correspondent
informs us that the editors of both   papers have been at great pains
to investigate  the circumstances.   Both give the same account, sub
stantially, of the accident and of    causes. The following particu
                                               its
lars are chiefly  extracted from the Manchester Guardian, with some
additions from the Manchester Chronicle.
  A   very serious and alarming accident occurred            Tuesday, Aprilon
12th,     the fall
         in        of  the Broughton suspension bridge, erected          few           a

                     it;  and, although fortunately                       no
                                                            lives were lost,
several   ofthe soldiers received serious personal injuries, and damage
was done       the structure, which will require
              to                                       long time and very

considerable expense       torepair.
  It   appears that,      onthe day when this accident happened, the

                                              at         barracks,  took the
road over the suspension bridge, intending                           go
                                                         through Pendleton

to the barracks.     Shortly after they got upon the bridge, the men,
who were marching four abreast, found that the structure vibrated
in unison with the measured step with which they marched; and
as this vibration was by no means unpleasant, they were inclined to
humour it by the manner in which they stepped.           As they pro
ceeded, and as a greater number of them got upon the bridge, the
vibration went on increasing until the head of the column had nearly
reached the Pendleton side of the river. They were then alarmed
by a loud sound something resembling an irregular discharge of
fire-arms; and immediately one of the iron pillars supporting the
suspension chains, viz. that which was to the right of the soldiers,
and on the Broughton side of the river, fell towards the bridge,
carrying with it a large stone from the pier, to which it had been
bolted. Of course that corner of the bridge, having lost the sup
port of the pillar, immediately fell to the bottom of the river, a de
scent of about sixteen or eighteen feet; and from the great inclina
tion thereby given to the road-way, nearly the whole of the soldiers
who were upon it were precipitated into the river, where a scene of
great confusion was exhibited.       Such of them as were unhurt got
out as well as they could, some by scrambling up the inclined plane
which the bridge presented, and others by wading out on the
Broughton side; but a number were too much hurt to extricate
themselves without assistance, which was immediately rendered by
their comrades.                                                   -   -
   The company consisted of seventy-four officers and privates; and
of these about sixty, including one officer (Lieut. Fitzgerald), were
upon the bridge at the time; the remainder had not reached the
bridge, and were left standing on the Broughton side, when the bridge
gave way.     Lieut. Fitzgerald being on a line with the leading file,
had   nearly reached the Pendleton side, where of course the incli
nation of the road-way was not so great as it was nearer the Brough
ton side. He, and a few of the men near him, did not fall from the
bridge, being merely thrown down on the road-way, but upwards
of forty men were either precipitated into the water, or thrown
with great violence against he side chains of the bridge. . Of these,
more than twenty received injuries of different kinds, six were so
much hurt that it was found necessary to procure two carts (some
of the men being taken out on one side and some on the other), for
the purpose of sending them to the barracks.      Four of them, whose
injuries are of a very serious nature, still (April 16th) remain in the
hospital.
   As the bridge, in the inclined position into which it was thrown
by the accident, blocked up a considerable portion of the water-way
of the river, and it would inevitably have been carried away in case
of a flood, a number of men were promptly           set  work
                                                          to     dis to
mantle the flooring      the end which had fallen down, which has
                            at

pair the injury which the structure has received from this alarming
accident, and      the same time

   Causes of the Accident.—As we conceive the public have a right
to be fully informed with respect to the causes of an accident of this
alarming nature, we have made some particular inquiries on the
subject, the results of which we shall lay before our readers; not
only that they may form an opinion upon this particular case, but
also that, they may be enabled to judge how far it is calculated
to render doubtful the security of structures of this kind,-a con
siderable number of which have now been erected in different parts
of the kingdom.
    Immediately after the accident, it was discovered to have arisen
from the breaking of one of the chains, by which the iron pillars
supporting the bridge are stayed and supported; and which chains,
as our readers are no doubt aware, are carried to some distance
on each side of the river, and secured to a great mass of masonry
sunk into the ground. By the breaking of this chain, the pillar
was of course deprived of                  its
                                  support, and the weight           the bridge                  of
immediately drew          from
                           it                its
                                     situation,       we have already deas
scribed.    It  remains then      ascertain the causes of the failure of
                                           to
the chain.     There      no doubt that the immediate cause was the
                           is
                                                                                        or by
powerful vibration communicated              the bridge

have already mentioned, are fastened to large masses of masonry
beneath the surface of the ground, and this fastening is made, in
each case, by means of a large disk of cast-iron, to which the first
link of the chain is bolted. That link, instead of being composed
like the others of two round bars of iron, and joined to the next
link in the manner above described, is composed of a strap of iron,
about 3% inches broad, and is joined to the second link by a bolt
in the manner represented in the subjoined sketch.
   Now it must be very obvious to any person who has the slightest
                                                   3–4
acquaintance with matters of this kind, that the bolt in this link,
 not being supported at the
ends as in the one above
mentioned, could not offer a     .

used in each case was of the
 same dimensions, namely, two inches in diameter. The weakness of
the latter joint was also greatly increased by a circumstance, which
is not very well represented in the engraving, but which we can
probably explain to our readers. The bars forming the link A being
round, only a very small portion of their surface touched the bolt;
and as they were two inches in diameter, the point of contact was
an inch distant from the side of the iron strap to which they were
joined by the bolt. The tension of the chain therefore might be
 considered as acting on the bolt with a leverage of an inch; and,
 under those circumstances it was not at                           all
                                               surprising that the bolt
 should give way.     Indeed       probable that, even
                                        it    is             had been               if
                                                                                     it
 iron   ofafair average quality, the joint would not have borne more
 than one-fourth,      perhaps one-fifth
                      or                                  of
                                           the tension which the other
joints would bear.
    But the bolt, instead    being good metal, was composed
                                  of                               iron                       of
 which was either originally bad,                   or
                                       had been rendered brittle                                        by
 mismanagement     in the process    forging the bolt.

                                     the fibrous appearance       good                        of
 iron. Under these circumstances, the wonder       not that the bridge   is,

   Before closing this article, we may observe that some very ex
cellent papers on chain bridges (one of them on this particular
structure) have been read at the Literary and Philosophical Society
in this town, by Mr. Eaton Hodgkinson, and, we understand, are
likely to appear in the forthcoming volume of the Transactions of
that Society. In the paper on the Broughton bridge, some defects
in    construction were pointed out, and particularly the insufficient

   Professor Wurzer, in analysing human blood according to Engel
hart's process by liquid tests, was led to suspect that he obtained a
small quantity of manganese: not being however quite satisfied as to
the correctness of his analyses, he was induced to repeat them in the
following manner. The blood, which had been obtained by venesec
tion, on the day before the experiment, was ignited in an open cru
cible, the incinerated mass oxidized by nitre, and then diluted with
water; the residuum was dissolved in muriatic acid, and the iron pre
cipitated from the solution by succinate of ammonia. As the precipitate
contained also some phosphate of lime, it was again ignited, and then
dissolved in muriatic acid; the phosphate of lime was separated from
the solution by alcohol, the excess of the latter expelled by heat, and
the iron precipitated by ammonia.     By boiling the filtered liquid with
carbonate of  soda,  the manganese  was precipitated, and then dissolved
in nitric acid and  again ignited.  In two grammes of the incinerated
residue there were found 0.108 of oxide of iron, and 0.034 of protoxide
of manganese.—Poggendorff's Annals.

   That there exists in white mustard-seed a peculiar crystallizeable
substance (sulfo-sinapisine),       constituted of the elements of sulfo
cyanogen, and an organic matter which develops the volatile                                 oil   of

and chlorine gases, &c.; and M. Thenard has stated the following as
the results of his experiments: No gas, by itself, is rendered luminous
by pressure exerted in pistons in the usual manner; pressure by hand
cannot raise the temperature of a gas in a glass tube much above
400° Faht. ; powders which remain undecomposed at this tempera

ACTION OF CHLORIDE OF BROMINE UPON WATER AND AETHER.
   M. Sérullas has found, that chloride of bromine, though perfectly
saturated with chlorime, does not decompose water; the formation
of muriatic acid, which occurs when it is agitated with aether, results
from the action of the chlorine upon the aether, and the same action
                                                                -
produces bromide of carbon.
  When chloride of bromine is agitated with aether and water, the
chlorine may be entirely separated in the form of muriatic acid,
before the bromine, which is isolated at the same time in the aether,
is converted into bromic acid and bromide of carbon; the alka
line chlorides and bromides, even in very small quantity, mixed
with oxide of manganese, slightly diluted sulphuric acid, and heat
ed in a proper apparatus, give a chloride of bromine, which is col
lected and treated as above with aether, to separate             elements;                    its

                                             M. Quesneville, jun, for pro

       REACTION OF PERSALTS OF IRON AND CARBONATES.
   M. Sorbeiran finds that the persalts of iron decomposed by neu
tral carbonates yield a carbonate of peroxide equally neutral: this
carbonate is soon destroyed to produce a double salt, formed by
the neutral alkaline sulphate and the subsulphate of iron, yielding
a new sulphate of iron, before unknown, and containing three times
as much base as the neutral salt: a weak alkali in excess precipitates
another subsalt, which has not been before noticed, but is a true
double salt, composed of the subsulphate of iron and the hydrated
peroxide. The aperient saffron of Mars is a hydrate of the peroxide
of iron, containing 3 atoms of water mixed with variable and acci
dental quantities of sesquicarbonate of iron, and sometimes neutral
 carbonate of iron.—Ibid. 1830, p. 535.
        IN FLAMMATION OF PHOSPHORUS BY CHARCOAL.
   Dr. Bache of Philadelphia states, that, at the temperature of 60°
Fahr. or upwards, carbon in the form of animal charcoal or lamp
black causes the inflammation of a stick of phosphorus powdered
with    it:
         the effect takes place either  the open air,          in                  or         close

   Sept. 8th–The aurora again appeared, more extended than on the
preceding evening.     I watched it for upwards of half an hour, when
clouds intervened and prevented further observation.
   Sept. 17th.-The aurora borealis again appeared, soon after eight
P.M., in the horizon between the north-west and north-by-east, from
which emanated seven or eight reddish columns of light, two of which
reached the star Benetrasch in Ursa major. Soon after nine P.M. the
aurora disappeared.
   Oct. 5.-At a quarter past seven P.M. an aurora again appeared
between the north and north-west.      A few very thin columns of light
emanated. About      eight  P.M. a few coruscations were visible, but
the rising of the moon  overpowered   them in light.
   Oct. 16.-About     half-past  nine P.M. the aurora again appeared
about the magnetic  north,  from which several columns of light, slightly
tinged with red, emanated, and attained the altitude of about 40°.
In one hour no traces of the aurora were visible.
   Oct. 17.—An aurora again appeared and bore a strong resemblance
to a morning twilight; no coruscations were visible, and it soon dis
appeared.
   Nov.  1–A  little before nine P.M. a bright aurora was visible be
tween the north and west points of the horizon; soon after nine, not
withstanding the moon shone very brightly, several columns of light
darted up near the magnetic north, some of which attained the height
of 20°. Clouds intervened about half-past nine, and the aurora was
no longer visible.
   Nov. 4.—An aurora appeared soon after seven P.M., which ex
tended from the north nearly to the west. About eight a few co
lumns of light were perceptible. The rising of the moon prevented
any further observation, and the aurora soon disappeared. Two
very bright meteors appeared soon after eight.
   Nov. 7.—A faint aurora was visible for more than two hours, but
 no coruscations were distinguished.         One bright meteor
                                                             -

about  half-past  seven.
   Dec. 11–At seven P.M. a very bright aurora borealis appeared be
tween the north-west and north-by-east points of the horizon; at eight,
clouds intervened, but at nine the sky again became clear, and very
large columns of red light were seen to rise quite to the zenith; it
increased in splendour till past midnight.        Some of the columns ap
peared as if tinged with black, and had the resemblance of dense
columns of smoke.        Two persons who were guarding their master's
property against the attacks of incendiaries, assured me that the red
columns continued to play in every direction, and on every point of
the compass between the east and west, till past four A.M. A respect
able gentleman in this neighbourhood, who has been an attentive ob
server of meteorological appearances         for   upwards of   forty years,
assured  me,  that   he
                      never recollected    during  that period the Northern
Lights  so powerful   in this country, nor did      heever observe   somany
meteors  in  any  one night in  his life-time
                                           ;      the number    he could not
ascertain, but  he  thought nearly twenty.
   Dec. 12–The aurora again appeared               atsix P.M. between the
                                                                      north

north-east   and north-west,     but few coruscations were visible till
 about ten  P.M., when several columns of white light darted in quick
 succession up to the zenith. Huge masses of white light, if I may so
 term them, rose in the north-west, and, as it were, sailed majestically
along the horizon to the true north, and some as far as north-east,
and then shot up in massy columns.        These appearances lasted till
half-past eleven, when the aurora began to diminish in brightness,
and in about two hours disappeared.       Two bright meteors appeared
in the north.
    Dec. 13.—The aurora again appeared light in strong twilight, but
no coruscations were visible.
   Dec. 14.—At six P.M. the aurora was again visible, but fainter than
                                       -
on the preceding evening.
   Jan. 7, 1831.-An aurora borealis appeared in the north-east,
which had a reddish tinge, and had a similar effect to the rising moon
on a hazy evening. At a quarter past five a zone of white light rose
from the centre of the aurora, passed over the Pleiades just below Aries,
and to the west-south-west point of the horizon, forming a complete
arc. After remaining in a perfect state for about three minutes, the
centre of the bow began to disappear, and in a few seconds the whole
vanished. Several patches of white light were afterwards formed in
the south-east and south-west, which remained for some time. At
twenty minutes past five, perpendicular columns of red and white
light darted up to the zenith, and some even passed the zenith and
reached Orion, having an altitude of about 30° south.        At half-past
five the northern hemisphere appeared to be covered with a complete
canopy of various coloured lights, which extended from north-east to
west, and exhibited one of the most magnificent appearances ever
witnessed in this latitude.     Columns of light continued to emanate
till  past  midnight.   The aurora did not finally disappear        till
                                                                    about
four A.M.
   Jan. 8.—An aurora was again visible for about two hours, but                 no
coruscations were visible.
   Jan. 1.—Was very cloudy evening, but having occasion
      I              a                                                     to   go
out about ten o'clock, the northern parts        the heavens appeared
                                                 at or an of
unusually light; the clouds dispersed, and       aurora presented itself
extending from north     to north-west; two     three coruscations were
visible, but clouds again intervened, and       eleven the aurora could
no   longer  be seen.
   N.B. After the aurorae     inNovember and December,         we
                                                              had strong
gales of   wind from the south and south-west; but since the appearances

  COLLEG 1 ATE INSTITUTION OF BRISTOL.
  A Collegiate Institution for the diffusion of the superior branches
of Education has been recently established at Bristol, by the joint
subscriptions of a proprietary body; it has been placed under the
superintendence of a Principal and Vice-Principal, who are distin
guished graduates from the University of Cambridge. As it was de
sired to place the Institution on an extensively useful and liberal
basis, impartial admission to the advantages it offers is conceded
without distinction to the members of different religious commu
nities : at the same time a large portion of the Council (being
members of the Established Church) have felt it their duty in no
manner to neglect the providing due means for the religious                                        in
struction of the pupils, belonging to the same persuasion, in the
tenets of that Church.    They have accordingly formed themselves
into a special committee, for the purpose of arranging an appro
priate course of Theological Lectures. The Rev. W. D. Conybeare,
who is Visitor of the College and Superintendant of       Examina                  its
tions, has undertaken the commencing course     these lectures, and     of
recently delivered three preliminary addresses, which are now                                       in
the press, and will shortly   published                      by
                                           Mr. Murray. The sub

                  Meteorological Observations                                        for March                1831.                    899
   The eclipse continued interesting till one minute after six, when clouds
intervened, and it was not seen afterwards by the naked eye. But at
twenty minutes past six, mean time, there was an opening in the cloud,
when by the aid of a telescope it appeared that the moon’s southern limb
had just emerged out of the earth's shadow, as the penumbra was then se
parating from the moon’s limb.
   AURORAE BohealEs.—In            the evening of the 7th of March 1831, an
aurora borealis appeared from seven till ten o’clock. It rose slowly the
first half-hour, and the arch of light, extending from the North-east by
North to North-west by West, attained                                               its
                                                         greatest altitude about half
past eight. Soon after eight two columns              light emanated from the aurora
                                                                               of
about sixty degrees West           North, and were followed

mine.    At quarter before nine several broad flame-coloured columns rose
                  a
through Cassiopeia, and suddenly changed                  red and lake colours; and  to
on receding, parts       them were left behind,which continued several minutes

casional coruscations from      till twelve, when

LIX.    On a Combination of Bicyanide of Mercury and Iodide
   of Potassium. By JAMES APJoHN, M.D. Professor of Che
   mistry to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.
    To the  Editors of the Philosophical   Magazine and Annals.
      Gentlemen,
               recently, in the course of some experiments upon
HAVINGthe salts of mercury, fallen upon a new, and, in some
respects, a rather remarkable compound,        I beg leave to com
municate to    chemists,   through  your   Journal,  the following
brief notice of it.
   When liquid hydriodate of potash is added to a solution of
corrosive sublimate, the well-known biniodide of mercury im
mediately falls down. This is a decomposition familiar to every
                j
chemist.    But if for corrosive sublimate we substitute the    bi
cyanide of mercury, notwithstanding the analogy in composi
tion between these two salts, no such double exchange of
principles takes place. A precipitate however in this case
also slowly forms, possessing the following properties.          It
occurs in very thin four-sided prisms, of a beautiful pearly
aspect. These are very soluble in hot water, but this fluid
scarcely acts upon them at the temperature of 60°.        Digested
with ammonia and potash they appear to experience no change;
and the same may be said of them when brought into contact
with the alkaline carbonates. When touched however with
a drop of muriatic acid, their colour is immediately changed
to a bright scarlet, and the odour of prussic acid is evolved.
A portion of them ignited in a platinum crucible left a residuum
which, when                 in water, gave a copious crystalline
precipitate with tartaric acid added in excess.
   From these experiments, and several others which it is

  unnecessary to detail, it became obvious that the crystals were
  composed of the two salts presented to each other.    The next
  object therefore, was to determine the relative proportions
  in which these were united. To effect this, 40 grains of the
  compound were dissolved in hot water, and a stream of sul
  phuretted hydrogen passed through the solution as long as
  it threw down any precipitate. This, (which by a previous
 experiment was known to be bisulphuret of mercury,) when
 perfectly dry, weighed 22:25 grains.      Hence as 232 (atomic
 weight of cinnabar): 252 (atomic weight of bicyanide of mer
 cury):: 22:25:24-16 = the bicyanide in the 40 grains.
     The solution from which the cinnabar was thrown down
 was now evaporated to dryness, in order to expel the whole
 of the prussic acid formed; and to the residue, which by a
 previous trial was found to be iodide of potassium, after being
 dissolved in water, nitrate of silver was added as long as it
 caused any precipitate.    This (the iodide of silver) collected
 upon a double filter, dried and weighed, amounted to 22:08
 grains.   Hence as 234 (atomic weight of iodide of silver)
 : 164 (atomic weight of iodide of potassium) :: 22:08: 15:47
  = the iodide of potassium in the compound. The 40 grains
 were therefore constituted as follows:             -
                 Bicyanide of mercury..............            24:16
                 Iodide of potassium................           15:47
                                                               39:63
Now, as 24:16:15:47 are very nearly in the ratio of 252: 164,
it is obvious that the compound consists of an atom of each
 of   its
       constituent salts.    And as,                by
                                          viewing these      destitute    as
 of oxygen and hydrogen, we account for the entire             grains,     40
      clear that  they are  present      bicyanide as
                                                    and   iodide,   not
is as it
    biperprussiate and hydriodate.       This latter conclusion also
      is

   It is almost unnecessary to observe, that the change of
colour already noticed as being produced in our compound
by the action of muriatic acid, is due to the development of
hydriodic acid, which passing to the bicyanide, produces at
the same time, biniodide of mercury and prussic acid.          A
similar effect is produced by any other acid capable of libe
rating hydriodic acid from the iodide of potassium.      In such
experiments it is clear that but one half of the mercurial salt
can be converted into biniodide; for one atom of the bicyanide
of mercury would require for perfect decomposition two atoms
of hydriodic acid, whereas but one can be developed from the
iodide of potassium.
   The iodo-bicyanide of potassium and mercury is probably
but one of a class of double salts which the bicyanide of mer
cury forms with haloid compounds.       This conjecture, how
ever,   I
        have not as  yet had time to put  to the test of experi
ment.

have been corrected in a more or less perfect manner by va

E.;      animal matter which is exhaled from some of the loca
 ities in which those remains are found, is noticed several
times. Thus, in the notes extracted from the Journal of Mr.
Collie, the surgeon to the Expedition, it is stated that “a very
strong odour, like that of heated bones, was exhaled wherever
the fossils abounded.”    In the extract from Capt. Kotzebue's
account of the same    spot it is observed, “We could not as
sign any reason for a strong smell, like that of burnt horn,
which we perceived in this place.” And “other observers,”
Dr. Buckland remarks, “have stated the same thing of the
mud cliffs in Siberia, near the mouth of the Lena, which con
tain similar organic remains.”—(Beechey's Narrative, Appen -
dix, pp. 599, 601, 604.)
    The odour emitted by burning bones and horn arises from
the development of ammonia, mingled or combined with                      vo

cal Journal, the temperature of the air in Eschscholtz Bay, rises
to above 70° Fahrenheit, and that of the surface of the sea to
above 50°, the solar radiation rising of course still higher than
the air; and the cliffs, consequently, during this season, are
constantly thawing. This change of temperature would liberate
the volatile matters, and permit the further decomposition of
the animal substances attached to or contained in the bones, so
as to impregnate the local atmosphere with effluvia, which the
 succeeding winter would have no power to fix again; though
 it might confine them to the vicinity, and prevent their further
 production until the next summer.

high water,” where the action of the sea, combined with the
alternations of temperature, would tend continually to their
decomposition.    We are not called upon to suppose that the
fossils are undergoing rapid decomposition, nor that their ex
halations are transmitted through dense saturated clay; but
that they are, and have been for many ages, undergoing slow
periodical decomposition, in mud, a portion of which is always
covered by the waves, and another portion covered at high
water*, therefore frequently in a semifluid state, and on that
account very favourable to the extrication of gaseous matter+.

decomposition           of

struction of animals by a mighty inundation, attended by a
sudden change of temperature from warmth to intense cold,
and the immediate burial of their remains in the detritus
swept together by that inundation.      Had the last change of
temperature undergone by the polar regions been slow, had
it been a gradual transition, of course occupying considerable
time, from their former high to their present very low tem
perature, the volatilizable substances of the animal remains
in Eschscholtz Bay and at the mouth of the Lena, would
have been dissipated by putrefaction, long before the freezing
of the diluvium and its contents.
   The facts of the preservation of the carcasses of the mam
moth and rhinoceros, prove the region in which they were found
to have been intensely cold at the time immediately succeeding
their death; but the odour now diffused by the organic re
mains in the diluvium of Eschscholtz Bay and of the mouth
of the Lena, affords collateral evidence to the same effect;

point without actually comparing the vertebra with the                    cor
responding bone of the Megatherium.                  The comparison of
 the   figure   given   by  Dr. Buckland with the description and
 engraving of the bones of the Megatherium contained in the
 last edition of Cuvier’s Ossemens Fossiles, afforded no deci
 sive indication on the subject, either negative or affirmative.
 Whether a similar comparison with the plates of Pander and
 D'Alton would lead to a satisfactory determination, I am not
 aware; and in this deficiency of evidence I mention my sup
 position, for the purpose of drawing attention to the subject.
 It is probable that the means of actual comparison with the
 Megatherium will shortly be afforded, by the arrival in Eng
 land of a perfect skeleton of that animal, recently announced
 as having been obtained by Mr.Woodbine Parish, at Buenos
 Ayres*.
    Should this vertebra ultimately prove to have in reality be
longed to a species of Megatherium, the fact will lead to further
interesting results.        An important object of inquiry will be,
whether the Megatherium was co-extensive on both continents,
with the extinct elephant, or whether, like the sloths, and the
ant-eaters (Myrmecophaga, Linn.,) to which it is allied, it was
confined to the New World, where, alone, the bones of the
Megatherium also have yet been discovered:#.                   The localities
in which the latter have hitherto been found, including that of
the skeleton in the possession of Mr. W. Parish, are included
within the parallels of about 40° south, and 40° north latitude;
and the remains of the allied genus Megalonya, have occurred
only between the parallels of 30° and 40° north.
   All   these remains, I believe, have been found in superficial
deposits of clay and gravel, &c., or in caverns; and under cir
cumstances which would have caused them to be referred to
the “Diluvial" era, until the recent discriminations on that
subject; but their history is at present too little known, to
permit us, in the actual condition of science, to point out, de
terminately, the epoch to which they belong. The view which
Dr. Buckland has taken of the mode of destruction of the
extinct Elephant, is equally applicable to the Megatherium, if
they were coexisting animals.

INdexterous;
    the art of carrying off their pillage, they are extremely
             and in the practices of deception on such occa
 sions they are peculiarly expert.         They sometimes commit
 their  depredations   during   the  day, when the flock and herds
 are dispersed in the fields, but more frequently at night, when
 they are collected for rest.      Should necessity permit of their
 exercising a choice as to time, they commonly prefer the de
 cline of the moon, so as to have the benefit" of darkness to
 assist them in the commission of the act, and the aid of light
 to facilitate in the carrying away of the spoil. The existence
 of rainy weather they also regard as favourable for such
 pursuits, on account of fire-arms being then less available;
 but, nevertheless, the circumstance of footmarks of every
 description being more distinctly imprinted at such times,
whereby they can be more readily traced, often prevents them
from availing themselves of the advantage in question. Having
once got possession of cattle, they invariably carry them across
the most parched and arid spots, and regularly in the direc
tions where water is least abundant, in order to incommode
their followers, or render pursuit impossible.               If
                                                         at the time
they commit their outrages, the country through which they
intend to return be very dry and destitute of water, they fur
nish themselves before they commence the expedition, with a
number of ostrich shells filled with that fluid, and those they
deposit successively in holes of the ground during the ap
proach to the scene of their intended operations, whereby they
supply themselves on their return with what may be necessary
to quench their thirst.      By these arrangements they readily
continue their retreat when their pursuers are forced to turn
back, and by such practices they often set at defiance the en
deavours of commandoes, either to destroy them or retake
cattie.    When they succeed in the object of their enterprise,
they either betake themselves to a convenient water-place, or
else to the spot where their families reside, and there kill and
eat till  all   be consumed.            happen that the means

either allowing a portion to go to waste, or to be consumed
when even far advanced in putridity.
     When in the act of driving away either cattle, sheep, or
horses, they are pursued and approached, they immediately
commence destroying them; and as soon as that is completed,
they betake themselves to flight*. Should, however, they dis
cover that by the time they have effected the first of those ob
jects, the latter cannot be achieved, they prepare for defence,
 and then according to circumstances, either are satisfied with
 attempting that in exposed positions, or else from behind
 rocks or stones; or, if time will permit, from holes formed in
 the ground. The dexterity and quickness with which they
 often form the latter, is matter of great wonder with the colo
 nists; and I have been told by persons who have been much
 in the habit of observing them in such situations, that almost
 in the course of a few minutes they will model cavities, in which
 two or three can conceal themselves, and avoid in a great
 measure the effects of fire-arms.               From such positions they
 send forth their arrows with              great  precision, and while in
  them they are regarded as nearly upon an equality with their
                                                                   opponents.
     * Field Cornet Louw, of the Aghter Hantam, writes,    “I  received a report
  on the 20th November, 1829, from the Burgher Hendrik Johannis Rygert,
  stating that five Bushmen had taken away, between the place of Middle
  kraal and Slang Fonteyn, three black cattle and two horses, belonging to
  Hendrik Wolfgraaf, when, having driven them a short distance, they shot
  them dead.     I immediately ordered out a commando, and proceeded on the
  23rd  following,  as far as the place Hinger Fonteyn, to discover their tracks
  and the road they had taken. I there ascertained that they had taken some
  more horses. I then proceeded nearly as far as the Fish river, where was a
  Bushman kraal, and finding that the aforesaid Bushmen had reached it be
  fore me, and had broken it up and gone to a greater distance, I resolved to
  return, the more on account of want of water.        On arriving at Hendrik
  Visage's he informed me that five Bushmen had again been in the colony,
  on the Hantam mountains, and that he had sent three bastards on their tracks.
  I then directed my commando to remain for the day, in order to call in the
  assistance of more people, as thinking it not strong enough.         One of the
  bastards ordered by me having gone to the place Brandwacht, to fetch his
  horses, discovered that the said Bushmen had taken two the day before.
  Following their tracks he found they had driven them into a deep kloof near
  the place; but being afraid to pursue them further, he returned to us to
  report the same. In consequence of the information, I repaired to the place
  the same evening, with my commando, and at a late hour sent out spies
  to see whether they were still in the kloof, but they made no discoveries.     I
  subsequently took the same thither, and came to the spot where it ap
  peared, by the remains of the horses, that they had been feasting upon
  their flesh, having previously pierced them with arrows.        Still following
   their track, I at length arrived at my own place, where, about 1000 yards
  from the house, I found they had driven off my horses, and at the distance
  of about half as much further, they had stabbed four of them and shot
  others with poisoned arrows, so as to cause their death.       Still in pursuit,

opponents.       If when
                       they are detected they be in the vicinity
 of rocks or mountains, they, after securing their plunder in
the way already described, retreat to those with amazing
rapidity, and from thence conduct their defence so dexte
rously and effectually, that seldom are they overcome. They
shelter themselves so completely behind the rocks, that shot
can produce little or no effect, and the uncertainty of their
actual resorts renders the assailants little disposed to venture
upon a close approach.     When in such positions, as well as
when in holes of the   ground,  the only effectual way in which
they can be secured or destroyed, is by approaching them
under the cover of a large shield, formed of the dried hide of
an ox, or of a hard rush or reed mat, and carried by one per
son, while another accompanies him prepared for an actual
attack.   Through those articles, the arrow will not penetrate
so as to produce much effect; and therefore, if they are not
in considerable numbers, or so close as that in advancing to
one, others are so situated as to be enabled to act with suc
cess, they may thus be subdued, and frequently are so, both
by the frontier farmers, as well as by the Namaquas, River
                                                                    Hottentot,
we found five more of my horses lying dead, one upon another, and on a
rocky rising ground, between the places Brandwacht and Malpes Fonteyn,
the robbers themselves.     Here they defended themselves to the last ex
tremity, in consequence of which, two of them were killed by the com
mando.”—MSS.
   A gentleman, who lately happened to be on the northern frontier of the
colony, at a time when the Bushmen had stolen 1200 sheep, says, “A com
mando, which I accompanied, pushed forwards as fast as possible upon the
traces of the thieves, and it was most lamentable to see the track so strewed
with dead sheep which had been destroyed by the plunderers.       It appears,”
he adds, “that the Bushmen never leave behind them any cattle alive
which, from fatigue, cannot go on, but invariably kill them with poisoned
arrows.” When they overtook them upon a high and rocky hill, they ap
peared much confused, but immediately dispersed themselves and got be
hind rocks, from whence they showered their arrows upon the farmers.
Of those the writer brought away two hundred.—MSS.
   “On the morning which was fixed for our departure,” says Mr. Kicherer,
“one of our   cows came home with an arrow sticking in her flank. Weim
mediately concluded that the Boschemen had driven away part of our herd.
In these cases, they oblige the cattle to run as fast as they can, and when
any of them are unable to keep up with the rest, they pierce it with a dart ;
in consequence of which, it falls on the road, and the carcass is fetched
away by the robbers on the following day. The cow which returned to us
had been thus treated, and served as a messenger to apprize us of what
had happened.     I dispatched some Hottentots with fire-arms to pursue the
track of the banditti; and in the mean time travelled on with the remainder
of the caravan. On the next day, my people joined us with seventy-three
out of eighty oxen, which had been stolen from us. They had happily fallen
in with the robbers, at the distance of a long day's journey beyond the hills,
and recovered the property; but two of our horses had been killed by the
fatigue."—Transactions of the Missionary Society, vol.  iii.   p.   12.

Hottentot, and Caffres.           On such occasions, however, when
 the defendants      perceive   that their efforts are likely to be                                        in
 effectual, they are apt to rush forth from their hiding-places,
 and approach with such a rapidity and ferocity as not unfre
 quently secures them a victory.
    Much difference of opinion exists as to their skill in the use
 of the bow: some certainly are very dexterous therewith, and
 will almost to a certainty, at a very tolerable distance, strike
 any object of moderate size, while others are less certain of
 their aim; but as a general position, it may be admitted that
 the majority will not shoot many times without effect, at a                                               di
 stance of sixty or even eighty yards, when the object in view is
 equal to the dimensions of a man.              As those weapons form
 their only articles of defence, as well as the means of pro
 curing a large proportion of their food, expertness in the use
 of them is a principal object of study, and one of the most fre
 quent amusements even of their early years. Every Bushman
 youth is furnished with his bow, and even the infant at the
 breast is frequently so supplied.         In the construction thereof,
 almost        all
               their art     centered; and

 and character best calculated for their        particular  objects, much
 ingenuity and cunning are often displayed.               The bow varies
in   size amongst different hordes, being with some between
 four and five feet         length, and with others not more than
                                     in

to the tube, without reference to the telescope.

short horizontal axis projecting from either side of the tube, it
might be inverted by making it describe exactly half a revolu

other, and the reversing of the bar would be unnecessary.

    We request the attention of geological students who may be pre
 paring to publish the results of their investigations, to the subjoined
 remarks by Mr. Phillips on the colouring adopted in his sections, &c.
    “With regard to the colouring, the natural prevailing hues of the
 strata have been generally imitated; but where two rocks could not
be thus well discriminated, the difference of their tints has been ne
 cessarily exaggerated.         It is a common opinion that                    geological           all
 works should          coloured upon one model; but what model shall we

   It is impossible without the sections to give any adequate notion
of the curious variations in the diluvium and alluvium described in
this part of the work. It is a subject of the greatest interest, and ap
parently few districts are more favourable for the inquiry than Hol
derness. The author gives the following summary          -

   “From the preceding description of the coast of Holderness, it is
evident that no formations appear there which can be considered as
older than the deluge. Of the diluvial accumulations, by far the most
prevalent, that which is the base of the whole cliff, is blue and brown
clay, containing dispersed pebbles ; above this, a more local deposit
of undulated laminated clay; and finally, gravel on the top, or mixed
with the pebbly clay.       In this formation           the teeth and tusks  lie                                   of

 thousand kinds of animals.     The peculiarities of form and structure
 among fossils are as constant and defined as among the living pro
 ductions of nature, and the species are often as well distinguished.
 Upon comparing them with existing races, it is discovered that they
 are generally quite distinct; so that the fossil tribes, in some degree,
 appear, like a separate creation, and have been elegantly termed
 ‘organic remains of a former world.'       But though different in de
 tail, the ancient and existing races of organic nature are alike in ge
neralities, and analogous in essential points of structure; and forcibly
urge us to conclude that they were destined for similar modes of life.
In the present economy of nature, plants of particular structure are
appointed to exist under particular circumstances; shells of certain
forms are peculiar to water, and others live habitually on land; and,
generally, so constant is the agreement in the structure and func
tions of organic beings, that from the one we may infer the other.
Who, that views the striking general resemblance of fossil and recent
bodies, and considers the similar accidents to which both have been
exposed, can hesitate for a moment to admit that conclusions drawn
from examination of the structure of fossils, are as valid as those
which are inferred from recent examples. The principle of investi
gation is in both cases the same, viz. the inevitable accordance be
tween the construction of the creature, and the uses for which it was
created.
     “From examinations      conducted on this principle, it is inferred
 that the  secondary  strata contain remains of marine, lacustrine, and
terrestrial  plants;  of marine and fresh-water shells, crustacea, and
fishes; and of aquatic and terrestrial reptiles, mammalia and birds.
This simple statement furnishes ground for most interesting deduc
tions respecting the ancient condition of the globe.          We cannot,
indeed, determine what was the comparative extent of          seas, lakes,          its
and dry land; but we may form very reasonable opinions concerning

importance  of this subject, I have sought the means of placing it in
a clear and correct light; and am not without hopes, that whether
my views be received or rejected, my statements will be found un
prejudiced, and, though incomplete, correct.
  “I    shall now endeavour to investigate some of the general laws,
respecting the relation of fossils to the strata, which are either
already recognised and admitted among geologists, or unfolded in
the following pages. The inquiry naturally divides itself into two
parts, according as the strata are considered, with respect to their
chemical and mineralogical composition, or their relative antiquity.
Considering rocks as definite chemical compounds, (an assumption
sufficiently exact in a limited district,) we may inquire if fossils of
the same kind belong to strata of the same character.
    “A decisive answer in the affirmative will suggest itself to him
who observes the agreement in this respect, between the transition
limestone and the mountain limestone, in their bivalve shells and
trilobites, between this latter rock and the oolites in their Astreas,
Turbinoliae, and Milleporae, and between the oolites and the chalk,

altogether when we attempt to extend it to a considerable series of
fossils; no other strata than the limestones exhibit it in a striking
degree, and few tribes of organic remains can be quoted in illustra
tion, except the Radiaria. On the contrary, the shells of the moun
tain limestone, oolite, and chalk, are                         all

         April 14.--Colonel                 Pasley's paper was resumed and concluded.
    The present paper is occupied with the detail of the experiments
  made by the author in the prosecution of the object of his former
  inquiry,  already submitted to the Royal Society, into the best
  means of obtaining an artificial Water Cement. These experiments
  were tried on a larger scale than the former, and were applied more
 especially to the practical purposes of building. He recommends that
 the cement should not be applied in two coats, the surfaces being
 less likely to adhere when this is done, than if the whole cement is
 applied at once.    He succeeded in various ways, in forming cements
 which appeared to be the same, in                               all
                                             their properties, with natural
 cements: and                    he
                      has now employed them             buildings           in

rometer is highest at new and full moons, and lowest at the qua
dratures, the extent of the fluctuations being 0.08 of an inch: ac
cording to the latter, the contrary is the case, and the extent is
only 0.05 of an inch.
   Lastly, the author endeavours to ascertain how far the barometer
is affected by the direction of the wind, and gives, in the form of
tables, the mean results of observations bearing upon this point.
The fluctuation, he observes, due to this, is much greater than that
due to any other cause. The barometer is lowest, as might be
expected, when the wind is in the rainy quarters of S.W. and
W.S.W. There are not yet sufficient data for any general conclu
sions with regard to the influence of electrical phaenomena on the
weather.
  April 21.—A paper was read, “On the Errors in the Course of
Wessels occasioned by Local Attraction, with some remarks on the
recent loss of His Majesty's ship Thetis.” By Peter Barlow, Esq.
F.R.S., &c.
   The author observes that the errors arising from the deviation of
the compass produced by the attraction of ships, were formerly
much less considerable than at present, from the comparatively
small quantity of iron existing in the vessel. The increase of this
disturbing force in a modern ship of war is easily accounted for by
the immense proportion of iron now employed in                  construction,its
by   the use    of
                 iron ballast and iron tanks,                 of
                                                     iron knees, iron cables,
and above all,       iron capstans, besides various other articles made

    The Thetis sailed from Rio Janeiro,              December last, with

 cargo.   The author shows that the deviation of the compass arising
from the attraction of the vessel, was exactly of the kind which was
likely to occasion this great mistake in the ship's reckoning: for
the distance run by the Thetis being about eighty miles, if the
local attraction of the vessel had been equal to that of the Glou
cester, she would have passed five miles nearer to Cape Frio than
her reckoning, —an error quite sufficient to account for the fatal ca
tastrophe. The author hence infers the importance of bestowing
more attention than has hitherto been given to the influence of the
local attraction of vessels, and to the application of the proper
means of correction.
   April 28.-A paper was read, “On the Anatomy and Physiology
of the Minute and Capillary Vessels.” By Marshall Hall, M.D.
   The author, considering the minute blood-vessels as arteries or
veins, as long as their subdivisions or junctions are attended with a
change in their dimensions, denominates them capillaries when no
such change occurs.      With the aid of an achromatic microscope of
Dollond's, he endeavoured to ascertain what differences existed be
tween the systemic and pulmonary circulations, as far as regards
these vessels. Dr. Edwards had observed that the batrachian rep
tiles are speedily killed by immersion in hot water: and the author
found that although by plunging any of the animals of that order
into water at 120° of Fahrenheit they are speedily deprived of all
power of sensation and of motion, yet the action of the heart con
tinues for a very long time, thus affording an opportunity of leisurely
observing the phaenomena of the circulation, without the infliction
of pain, and without any disturbance
                              -            from the struggles of the
animal.
       In the fins and tail of the stickleback, the number of the capillary
vessels is small, and their distribution simple: the artery runs along
the border of each ray till it reaches the extremity, when it is re
flected, and becoming a vein, pursues a retrograde course by the
side of the artery. This simplicity in the mode of           distribution    its
corresponds with the simple nature                      of
                                             the function       the part,          of

dimensions also are very nearly the same with those of the existing
quadrupeds.      The species, from the report of Mr. Clift, to whose exa
mination the bones were submitted, appear to be as follows: Kangaroo,
Wombat, Dasyurus, Koala, Phalangista,             the most abundant being
those of the  Kangaroo.      Along   with the remains just mentioned were
found two   bones,   not   agreeing   with those of any of the animals at
present known to exist in New South Wales. The first and larger
(of which a figure only accompanies this paper, the bone itself having
been sent to Edinburgh) is supposed to belong to the Elephant: the
second bone is also obscure and imperfect, but seems to be a part of
one of the superior maxillary bones of an animal resembling the
Dugong; it contains a portion of a straight tusk pointing directly
forward.                                                                        -
   A pit was dug, by Major Mitchell's direction, in the surface of the
ground about twenty-five feet from the mouth of the fissure, at a
place where no rocks projected; and the hill was there found to be
composed of a hard and compact breccia, such as that described above,
and abounding likewise in organic remains.                            -
   Other caverns containing a similar breccia occur in the limestone
on the north bank of the Macquarrie, eight miles north-east of those
at Wellington; and about fifty miles to the south-east, at Buree, are
several caves like the first described above, which communicate with
fissures partially occupied with breccia containing bones. At Molong,
thirty-six miles to the east of Wellington, a small quantity of con
creted matter has been found, containing numerous bones, of which
no specimens have been sent to Europe; but the author remarks that,
from their size, they would appear to have belonged to species larger
than those which at present occupy the country.                                -
   In  conclusion,  the author states that he can offer no        explanation
of the facts he has mentioned; and he points to the great resemblance
between the bony breccia of New South Wales, and that of the shores
of the Mediterranean described by Major Imrie, in the Transactions
of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

   April 27.—A Paper was read, entitled, “On some effects of the
atmosphere in wasting the surfaces of buildings and rocks:” by John
Phillips, F.G.S., &c.
   The remarks in this paper are restricted to the initial or prepa
ratory processes by which earthy materials are provided               for
                                                                   rivers and
the sea  to transport and deposit      in new situations. These processes
are considered     by the author under several heads, according              to
                                                                          their
chemical and mechanical relations; but            heobserves that           not

always possible    to distinguish accurately the effects         of
                                                                these several
causes, which indeed are commonly concerned                 inthe same ope
ration.

discovered in digging the foundation of the Yorkshire Museum.
   The more rapid waste of those parts of a building which are shaded
by a projecting ledge, is compared with analogous effects upon de
tached blocks of stone (like the Buckstone near Monmouth), which by
a further continuation of the process might be transformed into rock
ing-stones, as at Brimham Crags in Yorkshire. The rapid waste oc
casioned by fluctuations of heat and moisture is next examined; and
it is shown that the south and west fronts of buildings suffer most by
these variations; that when the composition of the stone is unequal,

 particulars:—
    “The length of the animal from the nose to the origin of the tail
 is eight inches; of the tail itself, one inch. The general external re
 semblance to the well-known Lemmings has been noticed, but these
 examples have but four toes on each foot, with one small naked pad
 under each toe : the two middle toes are the longest and equal, the
 outer toe the shortest, the inner toe intermediate in length, and on
 the hind feet of remarkable structure.
    “Immediately above a short curved nail there is a transverse row
 of horny points forming a pectinated apparatus; above this is a se
cond parallel row of stiff white bristles ; and over this, a third row of
bristles, which are much longer and more flexible : there are thus
 three distinct parallel rows of points of unequal firmness. The toe
next the inner one has two small fleshy tubercles above the nail,
covered by two rows of bristles, the under one short, the upper long;
 it has no horny points. The two outer toes, without tubercles, have
each only one tuft of long bristles.
    “With this described comb-like instrument on the inner toe only
of each hind foot, the little animals were observed to be continually
dressing their soft light brown fur; and the facility with which they
managed to reach every part of each lateral half with the toe of the
foot on that side, as well as the rapidity of the motion, were very re
markable.
    “When walking, the whole length of the hinder foot, from toe to
heel, was placed upon the ground; of the anterior extremity the
toes only rested on the ground.
    “When deprived of the skin, the head appears large compared to
the bulk of the body; it is wide and flattened in form: the meatus au
ditorius externus is elongated, forming a tube 2-10ths of an inch in
length on the inferior surface, and lined with a dense black pigment.
No cheek pouches exist. The teeth are of singular character,
the molars of the upper and under jaws being decidedly different.

Incisors; canine à, molars :=} The incisors of the upper jaw are
stout, square and truncated; the molars are oblong, flat and plain
on the inside, with one indentation on the outerside.          The incisors
of the lower jaw are slender and pointed; the molars somewhat dia
mond or lozenge-shaped, with one indentation between each of the
four angles. This character more particularly applies to the two an
terior molar teeth of each jaw, the last molar tooth, both above and
below, being more elongated.          From the superior incisors to the
molars, the roof of the mouth presented four prominent tubercles ante
rior to the usual rough expanse of the palate. The pharynr and a so
phagus were narrow. The lungs were made up of one large and two
small lobes on each side ; the heart presented nothing remarkable.
The liver paler than natural, soft, and granulated in appearance, was
composed of two small and one large lobe on the right side, and two
                                                                 ºlº

from the insertion of the ileum it was of small calibre, occasionally
dilated, forming sacculi, in which the faecal matter was collected and
detained. The rectum narrow and uniform in size; the whole length
of colon and rectum 3 feet 8 inches. The kidney of the right side was

said to be erect and straight, although properly speaking they bend
forwards and outwards, and become suddenly incurved towards their
tips.  These latter are rather acute, and the horns near them be
come  round;   below they are laterally compressed, and are marked
by a series of from fifteen to twenty rings, extending from the base
 to within six inches of the tip. On the lateral and dorsal surfaces
 of the horn these rings are little elevated, and present a wavy rather
 than a ridged appearance; but on the frontal surface they exhibit a
 succession of heavy, large ridges, with furrows between.
    Close to the outer margin of either nostril is a soft, fleshy, or ra
 ther skinny, tumour or tuft, about the size and shape of the half of a
domestic fowl's egg. These tufts, the purpose of which Mr. Hodg
son has been unable to discover, appear to be peculiar to the Chiru.

 months, when vast herds are often seen at some                                    of the rock-salt

 beds before they attempt to feed.

so described by the Prince, with the present bird, he found them

      the Himalayan of a chocolate brown;–the bill of the former is
yellow with a dark aper, and the legs are yellow, the same mem
bers in the latter being fuscous.  There are thus three species well
known of this genus; the Cincl. aquaticus, Pallasii, and unicolor,

            April 12, 1831. N. A. Vigors, Esq., in the Chair.
   Mr.    Coleman,    adverting to the statement made at the last meet
ing of the Committee that the female Armadillo had destroyed her
young, remarked that the cause of this apparent aberration of                in
stinct in a mother was generally to be found in the deficiency of
her supply of milk. In the many cases which had fallen under his
notice, in which female pigs, rabbits, and other domesticated ani
mals had destroyed their progeny, he had always observed that the
secretion of milk in the mammary glands of the dam was greatly, if
not entirely, deficient.

 of the Society's circular, and embracing the offer contained in it of

the zoological subjects which possess at the present moment the
greatest interest in Paris are those which have been transmitted
from Chili, by M. D’Orbigny, who is now engaged in travelling on
account of the Jardin des Plantes.         M. F. Cuvier has not yet ex
amined them with care; but he has observed among them a large
Rodent animal, which is probably the Patagonian Cavy of Pennant,
a species unknown to later zoologists: it forms the type of a new
genus allied to Anaema and Kerodon,              teeth having nearly theits

      May 13.-Mr. Brockedon on the passage of the Alps by Hannibal.
  Mr. Brockedon, from his extensive personal knowledge of the Alps,
  was enabled to review the accounts given of this passage, and to
  draw conclusions as to the true locality of the passage, which he
  believes took place over the little St. Gothard.
     May 20.—Mr. Robertson on a new practice of Painting, which
  unites the force of other modes with extreme durability.       Mr. Ro
  bertson's paintings are in water-colours, and upon paper.      He uses
 isinglass dissolved in hot spirit of wine between and over his colours,
 by which they acquire the brilliancy and force of oil; and when the
 picture is finished, he covers it with a colourless copal varnish. The
 pictures when large are lined with canvass and tin-foil. The dura
 bility and steadfastness of the colours appear to be extreme.
                CAMBRIDGE PHILOSOPHICAL           SOCIETY.
   . A meeting    of the Philosophical Society was held on Monday
 evening, May the 9th, Dr. F.Thackeray, the Treasurer, in the chair.
     There were presented to the Society a specimen of the Squacco
 Heron, by Mr. Price of St. John's College, and a very fine Coral
 line, from Madeira, by Mr. Lowe of St. John's College.—A paper
 by Mr. Pritchard of St. John's College was read, “On a method
 of simplifying the investigation of the figure of the earth considered
as heterogeneous.”      The remainder of a paper by Professor Whewell
 was also    read, “On the mathematical exposition of the leading
 doctrines in Mr. Ricardo's Principles of Political CEconomy and
 Taxation.”     It was shown that Mr. Ricardo's proposition, that a
tax    upon  wages  must necessarily fall upon profits, cannot be main
tained on his own principles. When stated mathematically,             the
question leads to an indeterminate problem, in which the rise of
price and the fall of profits mutually depend on each other, and
neither can be determined without some further assumption.            Si
milar modes of investigation were then applied to the doctrine of
exports and imports, and the different value of the money-metals in
different countries, in consequence of their influx and efflux pro
duced by manufacturing skill and other causes.         Finally, formulae
were given on which, according to such principles, the rate of ex
change will depend.      Mr. Whewell concluded by observing that he
did not put forward such formulae as applicable to practice, but as
exhibiting the results of Mr. Ricardo's theories: and that if the
principles were true and certain, mathematics would be the proper
instrument for obtaining their consequences.
     After the meeting Mr. Willis exhibited a numerous and curious
series of experiments upon the subject of sound.          Among these
were, first, the experiment (originally made by Hooke) of the pro
duction of the definite musical sound by the impulses of the teeth
of a revolving wheel upon a card; by means of which
                                                            continº  the

                     Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.                                                   463
the rapidity of vibration of a given sound may be determined.
This proceeding has recently been proposed anew by M. Savart.—
Mr. Willis produced also an invention of Professor Robison, in
which a definite sound is emitted by a stop-cock through which a
stream of            air
              passes, interrupted     regular small intervals. An
                                                                at

has called the                 Syren.                machine         of   Mr. Willis's invention was
exhibited (which      proposes     he
                                  call  Lyophone)       to

MR. GALBRAITH                          ON AN     OMISSION IN HIS PAPER ON NORTH
                                              POLAR DISTANCES.

                        the Philosophical Magazine and Annals.
     Gentlemen,
       my paper, published      the Philosophical Magazine for May
IN   last, there has occurred      omission, which
                                                     in
                                                     request you
                                                           an                           I                         to
supply     as      early          as   possible.
   The table was computed for the zenith distance, and therefore
cannot answer for the north polar distance without either forming
two tables,      using    constant with one table.    The latter plan
                           byor
                                          a
I preferred,     making the corrections for north polar distance                                                  to
the north        Greenwich negative, and applying the constant
                          of
+0":53 throughout the whole table.          The second part         the                                     of
table    or
          zenith distance south gives still the correction       zenith                                in
distance without the constant, and may         useful where that     re    be                                is
quired; and thus both purposes are served: the particular          had                                  I
in view when      gave the table double arguments.      From the time
I  had drawn                   I
                   the table till that when    wrote the explanation       I
and examples              of up
                   application, this circumstance escaped me,

 increased by +0":53, or,                                                                                                O             1             in

 which still further reduces the differences from Bessel's Catalogue.
    It would therefore be well for such as may be inclined to use the

   General Observations.—This    month has been generally fine and mild,
with the exception of a few days. The refreshing showers at intervals,
aided by the sun's influence in his progress northward, have quickened ve
getation; also the blooming of the fruit trees in the order of their time
throughout the month, and the blossoms are profuse.     Since the late rains
the grass fields and young wheat have much improved, and the former
have resumed their verdure and gaiety. These operations, now Nature has
revived from the sleep of winter, and the vegetable world from torpor to
animation, proceed rapidly, and afford to a close observer not only an in
expressible pleasure, but a consciousness of the constancy of an unerring
Providence; and we may rely on the promise that has hitherto been an
nually fulfilled, “While the earth remaineth, seed-time and harvest shall
not  cease.”
  In  the evening of the 12th instant, lightning emanated from the clouds

   AURoRAE Boreales.—From half-past eight P.M. in the evening of the

The streamers or columns of light began to ascend soon after nine; and
at twenty minutes past, the under edge of the aurora was best defined,
when        its
