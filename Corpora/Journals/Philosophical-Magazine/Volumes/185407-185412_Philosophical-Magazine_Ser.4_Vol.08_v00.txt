2      Dr. Tyndall              on the     Vibrations and Tones produced by
of the smaller Northumberland pipes, an instrument played by
his father's gamekeeper.  Not knowing the cause of the sound,
he thought that this person might be practising out of doors;
but on going out the tone ceased to be heard, while on his return
he heard it as shrill as before.         His attention was at length
attracted to the hot iron, which he found to be in a state of
vibration, and thus discovered the origin of this strange music.
 In 1830 he came to Edinburgh, and mentioned the fact to Dr.
 Reid; the latter, not knowing what Schwartz and Gilbert had
observed previously, regarded the phaenomenon as new, and re
 commended Mr. Trevelyan to investigate it more fully; Mr.
Trevelyan did so; among other things he discovered the form
to be given to the vibrating mass (the rocker) in order to obtain
the effect with ease and certainty. The results of his numerous
and well-contrived experiments were communicated to the Royal
 Society of Edinburgh, and were subsequently printed in the
Society’s Transactions.
   On the 1st of April 1831 these vibrations and tones consti
tuted the subject of a Friday evening’s lecture by Professor
Faraday at the Royal Institution.         The following extract from
the Journal of the Institution (vol.                   ii.

                                 undertake the further examination
of the subject.   On the 18th       March and    of the 1st    April   on                 of
1833 the results    his  inquiries
                           of      were communicated      the  Royal             to
Society     Edinburgh.
          by of            He dissents from the explanation sup
ported     Professor Faraday. The vibrations,         urges, are de         he
pendent for their existence                 on
                                the difference    temperature     of

face ofthe cold metal,               its
                            effect will       bring both surfaces
                                                       be    to                                       to

a common temperature, and thus to stop the vibrations, instead
of exalting them, as supposed by Professor Faraday.  Again, if
the phaenomenon be due to expansion, the greater the expan
sion the greater ought to be the effect; but the expansion de
pends upon the quantity of heat transmitted from the hot rocker
to the cold block during their contact, and this again upon the
conductivity of the block; so that instead of being a bad con
ductor, the block, to produce the greatest effect, ought to be the
best conductor possible.  The idea of an accumulation of heat at
the  surface being more favourable to the action than a rapid
communication with the interior, Professor Forbes regards as an
 “obvious oversight*.”
   Having thus, to              all
                      appearance, overturned the views previously
entertained, Professor Forbes proceeds      found    theory     his  to              a              of of
own.    His experiments have led him      the enunciation     cer

tain “general laws,” and these converge upon the still more
general conclusion,-‘‘ that there    repulsive action exercised
                                                      is  a                                                  in
the transmission     heat from one body into another which has
                          of
  less power    conducting it.” This repulsion Professor Forbes

a
considers    to “a new species     mechanical agency of   heat;”                               in

the subject.

my attention was drawn towards     last summer. The possibility

 tone, were set up as before.

    The pieces k and mnop (figs. 1 and 3) are plates of copper
screwed tightly on to the surface of the iron.               In this way a
single rocker is made to do the duty of two.

the vice, as in the former cases; and the copper portion of the
rocker was caused to rest upon                 slight shock, imparted

    The number of metals capable of this action might,     doubt                          I
 not, be greatly extended.   Thus far we have obtained vibrations

and these,        I
              think, are sufficient to show that the first general
law of Professor Forbes does not stand the test of eayeriment.
   Seebeck indeed had already proved the untenableness of this
law. His method of experimenting has been followed in one or
two of the cases above described.       The placing of the heated
rocker  upon  pointed wires is his idea. Rockings are very readily
obtained in this   way;  but when tones are required, the sharp
edge will,        I
             think, in general be found preferable.
   The second general law of action stated by Professor Forbes
is as follows:—
   “Both substances must be metallic.”
   This is the case which first excited my attention; for even
granting the final explanation given by Professor Forbes to be
the true one, the necessity     of the law before us does not at                               all
follow.   Previous       entering  upon the present subject,

                                                    these substances
might possibly       made       be              to

law restricts         to
                 metals.
   My first attempts failed through want            delicacy,     first      of           as
attempts generally do. But little practice suggested the means
                                                     a
of  imparting      the rocker the requisite degree

rocker was laid upon them,         very slight force was sufficient
cause   it   to
             oscillate. By this means        had the satisfaction

I    shall now proceed     describe the results obtained with non
                                           to
metallic bodies.
  1.   Rock-crystal.—The    brass rocker already described was
heated, and placed upon the natural edge            the prism; the            of

8        Dr. Tyndall               on the        Vibrations and Tones produced by
stem was supported by a knife-edge, so that the rocker                                                          lay
nearly horizontal: a strong tone was thus obtained.
   Vibrations also followed when the rocker was laid upon                                                   the
edge of the pyramid which caps the hexagonal prism.
   The experiments were repeated with fumy quartz, and                                                          the
same result was obtained.
  2. Fluor-spar.—A smaller brass rocker than that last used
was found to answer best with this crystal. The dimensions
corresponding to AC, AB, fig. 1, were 38                   and 1:25 in.             in.
respectively; while the depth was the same,            nearly       This          or                 so.
rocker having been placed upon the natural edge              the crystal                   of
line cube,       clear and melodious note was instantly produced.
                    a
Forcible vibrations were also obtained with the larger rocker,
but not so clear      tone.   a
    The angle            of
                    the cube was cloven off             expose the edge so    as   to
of  the octahedron;         this edge  on
                                      also vibrations were obtained.
    Fortification Agate.—Distinct vibrations and tones were ob
tained with the large brass rocker.            found     sometimes con
                                                                   I               it

 bar, with small knobs        the ends, across the rocker—a mode

 nearly half       hour; and when
                         an             ceased,    was under the tem

cube, and was        placed that the straight line formed
                              so                                  the in                          by

heat. With proper precautions, feeble, but well-established
vibrations were obtained.
    Onya.-A     distinct tone.
    Tourmaline.—After        many trials    I  obtained  a  continuous
vibration and low tone.                                                 -
   Fossil Wood—Two different specimens were examined, and
distinct tones obtained with both of them.
   Banded Agate.—Strong and continuous vibrations, when the
rocker was very hot.
   Chalcedony—Loud          and long-continued    knockings on   a knob
of this mineral.
   Glass.-Decided vibrations on the smooth rounded edge of
the foot of a drinking-glass.       Mr. Trevelyan believed that he
once  obtained vibrations upon glass, but the fact is doubted by
Professor Forbes. This is the only experiment on non-metallic
bodies, as far as   I  am aware of, hitherto on record.
   Earthenware.—A feeble tone, which soon ceased, was obtained
on the edge of a dinner plate.
   Flint.—A decided tone, though not so strong as that obtained
from rock-crystal.
   Lydian Stone.—Permanent vibrations.
   Heliotrope.—A durable tone.
   Iceland-spar.—A       lighter rocker than any of those hitherto
described was found necessary in experimenting with this cry
stal.   The mass is soft, and is readily bruised by the rocker
when the latter is heavy.         With a suitable instrument a con
tinuous feeble tone was obtained.
   Red Haematite.—Distinct tones were produced by several spe
cimens of this mineral.
   Arseniacal Cobalt.—A strong tone.
   Meteoric Iron from Mearico.—A low musical tone.
    This list might be readily extended.          The substances men
tioned in it were chosen on account of their accidentally pre
senting the conditions favourable to experiment.         The principal
condition is a clean even edge.          Several of the minerals pos
sessed such edges cut artificially; others possessed them natu
rally.    In the case of chalcedony, the rocker was placed upon a
rounded knob; in the case of tourmaline, one of the ridges,
which usually run along the surface of the prism, served as a
 support; with glass and earthenware, the surfaces were smooth
 and rounded. As a general rule, however, I have found an even
 edge best.    With such an edge, and rockers similar to those
 described, no difficulty will be experienced in repeating and ex
 tending these experiments.
    It is usual to permit the knob at the end of the handle of the

10         Dr. Tyndall on the Vibrations and Tones produced by
rocker to rest upon a flat surface, while the instrument itself
leans slantingly against the bearer.     In delicate experiments, I
think a knife-edge is a better support for the handle, the rocker
being placed horizontal, or nearly so.
   Omitting the last three substances, which might, perhaps,
with some justice be regarded as metallic, we find a number of
exceptions to the law under consideration, which far exceeds the
number of bodies mentioned in the paper of Professor Forbes.
These exceptions demonstrate that the second law also is untenable.
   The third general law runs as follows:—                            -
   “The vibrations take place  with an intensity proportional (within
certain limits) to the difference of the conducting powers of the
metals for heat, the metal having least conducting power being
necessarily the coldest.”
   The evidence adduced against the validity of the first law ap
pears to destroy this one also; for if the vibrations are to be
ascribed to a difference in the conducting powers of the rocker
and bearer, then when there is no such difference there ought to
be no vibrations. But we have shown, in half a dozen cases,
that vibrations occur when rocker and bearer are of the same
metal.         The same facts deprive the latter part of the third law
of   its   significance.
I     will however cite one             or
                               two experiments,   which the con    in
ditions  regarded  necessary          by
                                 Professor Forbes were reversed,
and the effect was   produced notwithstanding.

earistence      of
              the third law.
     Inthe  prosecution    his inquiry, Professor Forbes discovered
                                 of
“ that     least two metals were perfectly inert
           at                                      either situation,
                                                                  in
namely, antimony and bismuth.”         Considering the explanation
given, that the effects are due    the mechanical repulsion exerted
                                           to
by the heat               its

                     in               good conductor
                                                a          bad one,         to  a
the inertness         of
                  the two bodies mentioned presents     grave diffi         a
culty.   Reflecting     the     on
                             subject, the thought  occurred     me,                     to
that if   mass
           a          of
                   bismuth     antimony were cut
                                      or             that the plane    so
of  most eminent cleavage might        vertical, the superior con
                                                    be

      the Contact             of   Bodies having different Temperatures.                                 11
ductivity which the mass probably possesses in the direction of
the said cleavage might aid in the production of the vibrations.
I cut such a piece from a mass of antimony, and fixed it in a
vice, so that the horizontal edge on which the large brass rocker
rested was perpendicular to the surfaces of principal cleavage.
Loud and sustained vibrations were the consequence.      repeated                         I
the experiment in the case of bismuth with equal success; and,
after a little practice, found that the precaution of cutting the
substances in the manner just described was wholly unnecessary,
and that tones could be obtained with facility, no matter what
might be the direction in which the mass was cut.
   We have thus proved antimony and bismuth to be active in
one position at least; but antimony is active both as rocker and
bearer.    Two irregular masses, the one weighing about a pound
and the other five pounds, were so filed down as to present
suitable surfaces for rocking.       Heated, and placed upon a flat
mass of lead, both masses vibrated permanently.          These experi
ments add their evidence to that        already  adduced against the
third law; for antimony is a worse conductor than lead, and
antimony is here the hottest metal.
   These results appear to leave the theory of Professor Forbes
without any foundation.        One point only remains to be con
sidered.    Professor Faraday attributes the superiority of lead as
a bearer to         its
                    great expansibility                    by
                                            heat, combined with                                           its
deficient conducting power. Against this view Professor Forbes

 greater quantity             of
                        heat will pass into      during contact, than
when  it    is bad one.       cannot    Itdenied that the greater the
                                                      be

              heat transmitted, the greater will        the expansion;        be
 and hence the conclusion seems       unavoidable,  that,    the vibra               if
tion  be  due     expansion, both rocker and bearer, other things
                    to

Prof. Buff on the Conductivity      of Heated Glassfor Electricity.                           13
new, which   I have recently made in connexion with this subject,
are, I think, worthy of publication.
   Various kinds of glass exhibit, as everybody knows, great dif
ferences in respect to their power of insulation.   Potash-glass is
in general  the best, and soda-glass  the worst insulator.  One of
my hearers, Mr. Matthieson of London, showed me a description
of glass, which, when covered on both sides with tinfoil, was
completely incapable of assuming a charge.        With very slight
tension the two electricities crossed the glass and united with
each other.     By chemical analysis it was found that the glass
in  question   was a soda-glass     almost completely free from
potash.
                          I
    In my experiments used, for the most part, glass vessels of
very small thickness, in the form of chemical test tubes.             This
glass, although not difficult to fuse, proved at ordinary tempera
tures, and when dry, to be a good insulator. To ascertain the
limits at which this property was lost, a tube 39 centims. long,
2 centims. exterior diameter, and 0.7 of a millim. in thickness,
was filled with water to a height of about 6 centims.            Into the
water    dipped  a platinum   wire,  which remained in connexion with
the positively charged conductor of a small electric machine. At
a moderate heat no diminution of the insulating power was
observed; but when the temperature reached 40° or 50° C., on
touching the exterior surface of the glass with the end of the
helix of a very sensitive multiplying galvanometer, the other end
of which was in connexion with the earth, a motion of the astatic
needle of the instrument could be observed.            When the tempe
rature of the liquid approached             its
                                          boiling-point, the flame which
encompassed the tube began          towaver, and was repelled from the
surface  of   the glass.     When the surface was discharged the
wavering   of  the flame ceased, and         the same time the electro

 although the machine was turned persistently, thus showing that
 the electricity passed speedily through the glass.         By approach
 ing the knuckle, sparks were obtained.                              Bun

ments was almost perfectly spherical; the height of the interior
column of mercury after the introduction of the thermometer
was carefully measured, and before commencing the experiments,
the surfaces of the metal within and without the tube were brought
exactly to the same level.      By means of a cork which embraced
the small tube, and fitted into the exterior one, the necessary
position was easily secured.
   The heating was effected by means of an Argand lamp, above
the glass chimney of which the apparatus was placed and well
insulated. The heat generated by this lamp, the wick of which
could be regulated with the greatest nicety by a suitable screw,
was sufficiently great to elevate the mercury to           boiling tem              its

18     Prof. Buff on the Conductivity of Heated Glass for Electricity.
It was sufficiently powerful to deflect the needle of the tangent
compass, after the removal of the battery, when the coatings were
connected with the ends of the helix of the instrument.     A de
flection increasing with the temperature of the glass was thus
remarked, although the tension must have been diminished at
the higher temperatures.    At ordinary temperatures, where the
tension was greatest, no action whatever was produced upon the
needle.
   This decrease of the intensity of the charge, and the simulta
neous increase of the quantity of the electricity conducted from
the surfaces of the glass, is quite irreconcileable with the motion
of a charge similar to that of the Leyden jar, or a condensation
of the electricity on the opposite surfaces of the glass. The effect
is a natural and necessary consequence of the assumption, that
the glass softened by heating, like a liquid conductor under the
same circumstances, has endured a polarization, that                 che                            is,

fore, from the amalgam through the glass to the peroxide, and
thence through the connecting wire, just as it would proceed had
water been used instead of glass.        The charge was augmented
considerably by heating the apparatus, and it was found that
such an arrangement was capable of exhibiting phaenomena of
polarization similar to those already described.
   Piles can also be formed without difficulty in which the
liquid conductor is superseded by glass.       Brass discs gilt, clean
discs of zinc and thin   plates of glass,  were placed one over the
other in the same order. To the first gilt disc, and also to the
last which covered the tenth plate of glass, platinum wires were
attached; the pile thus formed was only 4 centimetres high.
The plates were so pressed together that they might be exposed
to the hot current of an Argand lamp. When time was permitted
to this little pile, the condenser at ordinary temperatures could
be charged to a tension of three or four lines divergence of the
gold-leaf electrometer.      When the discs were heated, a few
seconds’ connexion with the condenser produced a divergence of
at least fourteen lines.      Such a pile constructed in 1853, and
often used, did not in five months lose in the smallest degree                               its
primitive electroscopic force.

amounts to supposing the apse and mode to have certain mean

the complete solution.                 - .
   The fact that the differential equations are satisfied by these
expressions for r and 6, whatever be the value of e, is quite suf
ficient to show that Professor Challis is mistaken in restricting
e to one particular value.
   The terms of the second order in the value of r, which depend
on the arguments
         2nt-i-e—2n't --e' and 2nt-i-e—2n't --e'-cnt-He—or,
and which constitute the well-known inequalities called the
“variation” and the “evection,” prove the incorrectness of Pro
fessor Challis's Theorem I. ; since in an orbit described by a
body acted on by a force tending to a fixed centre, and varying,
as Professor Challis supposes, as some function of the distance,
the expression for the radius-vector in terms of the time cannot
possibly contain any terms dependent on the sun's longitude.
     I
     now come to consider the reasoning by which Professor
Challis arrives at his theorems.   All this reasoning is based on
his equation

the truth of which, he says, cannot be contested.  In speaking of
the truth of this equation, Professor Challis cannot mean that it
is anything more than an approa'imation to the truth, since in
forming it he avowedly neglects       quantities      all
                                                   orders superior of
to the second.
   Now what assert
                 I               is,
                       first, that the degree    approacimation        of

32       Mr.  J. C. Adams on Professor Challis's new Theorems
.
    The equation above deduced from Professor Challis's differs
from this by the omission of the last term, which gives rise to
the variation inequality.      In order to find the evection, which is
also an inequality of the second order, it would be necessary to
        the approximation one step still further than we have here
  OIle.
    This shows how unfitted equation (C) is for giving any accu
rate information respecting the moon’s orbit.
    As a matter of fact, it may be observed that this equation
would make the moon’s apsidal distances to be constant.              A
simple inspection of the calculated values of the moon’s hori
zontal parallax, given in the Nautical Almanac, is sufficient to
show how far this is from the truth.
    I now proceed to make good my second assertion, viz. that
Professor Challis's Theorem II. cannot be inferred from his equa
tion (C). The process by which he attempts so to infer it is of
the following nature.       He first finds that a method, apparently
legitimate, of treating the equation (C) leads to a difficulty. To
get rid of this difficulty, he makes the strange supposition that the
equation (C) contains the disturbing force as a factor, and then
tries to show that, in order that this condition may be satisfied,
the arbitrary constants h and C must have a certain relation to
each other, from which it would immediately follow that the
eccentricity must have the value assigned to it in Theorem II.
    Now it is remarkable that every one of the steps of this pro
cess is unwarranted.       The difficulty to which Professor Challis
is led is  purely  imaginary;    the supposition that the equation (C)
contains the     disturbing  force as a factor is wholly unsupported
by any proof; and even if that supposition were well founded,
it would not follow that the constants h and C must have the
relation assigned to them by Professor Challis.                      -
    The supposed difficulty is founded on the inference at the
bottom of p. 280 of Professor Challis's paper, “Hence we must
conclude that the mean distance and mean periodic time in this
approximation to the moon’s orbit are the same as those in an
elliptic orbit described by the action of the central force ;"     But
this is not a correct conclusion: if h and C be supposed to have
the same values in equation (C) and in that obtained from it by
putting a for r in the small term, the values of the mean distances
in the two cases would not be the same, but would differ by a
quantity of the second order.
    This may be readily shown in the following manner.
    At the   apsides
                      #=0.    and therefore the equation (C) gives the

of bromine.              It
                   is clear from the results of the above analyses,
therefore,  that the bromopicrine prepared in the manner just de
scribed is impure,   and contains a quantity of a substance which is
richer in bromine, most probably the carburet of bromine (C*Br”),
which maybe readily produced by the long-continued action of bro
mine on bromopicrine.         It is necessary, therefore, to prepare
bromopicrine by some other process where such a decomposition
is not likely to be produced.      Nitropicric acid was consequently
digested with excess of hypobromite of lime, in a manner pre
cisely similar to that by which I many years ago prepared
chloropicrine. The bromopicrine obtained was washed with
solution of carbonate of soda, agitated with mercury, and ren
dered anhydrous by chloride of calcium. When analysed—,

  Bromhydranil,   C*Br” H*0°.—When          sulphurous acid gas is
passed through hot spirits of wine  containing  an excess of brom
anil, the bromanil gradually dissolves, and a colourless solution
is produced.    When this solution is sufficiently concentrated,
bromhydranil is deposited in colourless crystals, which have a
mother-of-pearl lustre.     When bromanil is boiled with an
aqueous solution of sulphurous acid, bromhydranil is also pro
duced, but extremely slowly, because bromanil and bromhydranil
are both nearly insoluble in water.
   Bromhydranil is very soluble in alcohol and in aether, but it
is nearly insoluble in water, and is therefore precipitated as a

giving rigorous solutions in particular cases, he examined the

the conditions to be satisfied, so that it was entirely by analytical
 difficulties that he was stopped.          As an example of the success
of his theoretical investigations, we may refer to the well-known

according to Mr. Faraday's researches “on induction in curved
lines,” which will be referred to below, the intensity never
absolutely vanishes at any point of the uninsulated body: but
it is readily seen that in the case of Mr. Harris's experiments,
it will be so slight on the unopposed portions that it could not be
perceived without experiments of a very refined nature, such as
might be made by the proof plane of Coulomb, which is in fact,
with a slight modification, the instrument employed by Mr.
Faraday in the investigation.   Now to the degree of approxi
mation to which the  intensity on the unopposed parts may be
neglected, the laws observed by Mr. Harris when the opposed

tical theory. Thus let v be the potential in the interior of the
charged body, A a quantity which will depend solely on the
state of the interior coating of the battery with             in Mr.
Harris's   experiments    A is  connected,   and will therefore be
sensibly constant for different positions of A relative to the
uninsulated opposed body B.         Let a be the distance between
the  plane  opposed   faces of A and B, and let S be the area of
the opposed   parts  of these faces, which will in general be the
area of the smaller, if they be unequal.       When the distance a
is so small that we   may  entirely neglect  the intensity on      the                                  all

Though however this formula may give results which do not
differ very much from observation within a limited range of
distances, it cannot, according to any theory, be considered as
expressing the physical law of the phaenomenon. For, according

produced by the presence of such bodies in disturbing the
observed law of force, must be to make it diminish less rapidly
with the distance when A and B are separated by a considerable
interval: and it is probably owing, at least in part, to such dis
turbing causes that Mr. Harris's results nearly agree, as far as
they go, with a formula which would ultimately give for the law
of force the inverse square of the distance between A and B,
instead of the inverse cube.

would present considerable difficulty by means of the formulae
ordinarily given for such problems. It may, however, very
readily be effected by means of a general theorem on the attrac
 tion between electrified conductors, which will be given in a
 subsequent paper*.     Thus, if F         the force    (c)

   To compare these with Mr. Harris's measurements we may
calculate the value of the potential in his battery, during the
observations, by means of his first result, and thence find the
attraction for the other three cases by means of the calculated
values of v-PF (c).  Thus we have v-*x 15=3293, which gives
                          w°–45-56,
and hence                       F(2,5)=7.94,
                                F(2:8)=4:18,
                                    F(3)=3:00.
  These numbers differ considerably from Mr. Harris's results,
but in the direction indicated by the considerations mentioned
above.
   5. The most important part of the researches of Mr. Harris
is that in which he investigates the insulating power of air of
different densities.    The result at which he arrives           that the      is,
intensity necessary         produce

                                vacuum,  aare due    solely     the rare   to
faction of the air       in
                      each case.     He also shows that the intensities
necessary      produce
               to            spark, are
                                   a         the simple ratios

densities of the air.

and further, it may I think be shown that either method of
viewing the subject, when carried sufficiently far, may be made
the foundation of a mathematical theory which would lead to
the elementary principles of the other as consequences.                This
theory would accordingly be the expression of the ultimate law
of the phaenomena, independently of any physical hypothesis we
might, from other circumstances, be led to adopt.               That there
are necessarily two distinct elementary ways of viewing the
theory of electricity, may be seen from the following considera
tions, founded on the principles developed in a previous paper
in this Journal+.
   Corresponding to every problem relative to the distribution
of electricity on conductors, or to forces of attraction and re
pulsion exercised by electrified bodies, there is a problem in the
uniform motion of heat which presents the same analytical
conditions, and which, therefore, considered mathematically, is
the same problem. Thus,                  conductor         be let

The problem in each case is determinate, and we may therefore
employ the elementary principles of one theory, as theorems,
relative to the other. Thus, in the paper in which these consi
derations are developed, Coulomb's fundamental theorem relative
to electricity is applied to the theory of heat; and self-evident
propositions in the latter theory are made the foundation of
Green’s theorems in electricity*.    Now the laws of motion for
heat which Fourier     lays down in his Théorie Analytique de la
 Chaleur, are of that simple elementary kind which constitute
a mathematical theory properly so called; and therefore, when
we find corresponding laws to be true for the phaenomena pre
sented by electrified bodies, we may make them the foundation
of the mathematical theory of electricity: and this may be done
if we consider them merely as actual truths, without adopting
any physical hypothesis, although the idea they naturally sug
gest is that of the propagation of some effect by means of the
mutual action of contiguous particles; just as Coulomb, although
his laws naturally suggest the idea of material particles attract
ing or repelling one another at a distance, most carefully avoids
making this a physical hypothesis, and confines himself to the
consideration of the mechanical effects which he observes and
their necessary consequencest.
    All the views which Faraday has brought forward, and illus
trated or demonstrated by experiment, lead to this method of
establishing the mathematical theory, and, as far as the analysis
is concerned, it would, in most general propositions, be even
more simple, if possible, than that of Coulomb.    (Of course the
analysis of particular problems would be identical in the two
methods.)      It is thus that Faraday arrives at a knowledge of
some of the most important of the general theorems, which,
from their nature, seemed destined never to be perceived except
as mathematical truths.       Thus, in his theory, the following
proposition is an elementary principle.     Let any portion a of
the surface of A be projected on B, by means of lines (which
will be in general curved) possessing the property that the
resultant electrical force at any point of each of them is in the
 direction of the tangent: the quantity of electricity produced
by induction on this projection is equal to the quantity of the
 opposite kind of electricity on af. The lines thus defined are
 what Faraday calls the “curved lines of inductive action.”   For
   * It was not until some time after that paper was published, that I was
able to add the direct analytical demonstrations of the theorems, which
are given in the papers on “General Propositions in the Theory of Attrac:
tion,” Math. Journ. vol.  iii.pp. 189, 20I, and which
                                                    I    have since found

that the dissimulating power of a Leyden phial depends on the
nature of the glass of which it is made, as well as on its thick
ness, have been by some attributed to a slight degree of con
ducting power, or of penetrability, possessed by solid insulators.
This explanation, however, seems to be very insufficient; and
besides, Faraday has estimated the nature of the effects of imper
fect insulation, by independent experiments, and has established,
in what seems to be a very satisfactory manner, the existence of
a peculiar action in the interior of solid insulators when subjected
to electrical influence.       As far as can be gathered from the
experiments which have yet been made, it seems probable that a
dielectric, subjected to electrical influence, becomes excited in
such a manner that every portion of                                  it,

action                      surfaces, produce the resultant force
                  due to the charged
at any point.    It is no doubt possible that such forces at a
distance  may be discovered to be produced entirely by the action
of  contiguous particles of some intervening medium, and we
have an analogy for this in the case of heat, where certain effects
which follow the same laws are undoubtedly propagated from
particle to particle. It might also be found that magnetic forces
are propagated by means of a second medium, and the force of
gravitation by means of a third.       We know nothing, however,
of the molecular action   by which such effects could be produced,
and in the   present  state of physical science it is necessary to
admit the known facts in each theory as the foundation of the
ultimate laws of action at a distance.                  -

   Coulomb has expressed his theory in such a manner that it can only be
attacked in the way of proving his experimental results to be inaccurate.
This is shown in the following remarkable passage in his sixth memoir,
which follows a short discussion of some of the physical ideas then com
monly held with reference to electricity.    “Je préviens pour mettre la

   Becquerel discovered that if one junction of copper and iron, in a
circuit of the two metals, be kept at an ordinary atmospheric tem
perature, while the other is raised gradually to a red or white heat,
a current first sets from copper to iron through the hot junction, in
creasing in strength only as long as the temperature is below about
300° Cent.; and becoming feebler with farther elevations of tempera
ture until it ceases, and a current actually sets in the contrary direc
tion when a high red heat is attained.       Many experimenters have
professed themselves unable to verify this extraordinary discovery,
but the description which M. Becquerel gives of his experiments
leaves no room for the doubts which some have thrown upon his
conclusion, and establishes the thermo-electric inversion between
iron and copper, not as a singular case (extraordinary and unex
pected as it appeared), but as a phaenomenon to be looked for be
tween any two metals, when tried through a sufficient range of tem
perature, especially any two which                                lie
                                                     near one another            the                             in

verified M. Becquerel's conclusion            far,        so

specific heat of the same electricity in the other metal, at the tem
perature t; F the thermo-electric force in the circuit when the two
junctions are kept at the temperatures S and T respectively, of which
the former is the higher; and 0s the amount of heat absorbed per
unit of electricity crossing the hot junction. The following relation
 (similarly simplified in form) was also established:—
    These relations show how important      it is towards the special ob
ject of determining the specific heats of electricity in metals, to in
 vestigate the law of electromotive force in various cases, and to de
 termine the thermal effect of electricity in passing from one metal to
 another at various temperatures.      Both of these objects of research
 are therefore included in the   general investigation of the subject.
    The    only progress  I have as   yet  made in the last-mentioned
 branch of the inquiry, has been to demonstrate experimentally that
 there is a cooling or heating effect produced by a current between
 copper and iron at an ordinary atmospheric temperature according
 as it passes from copper to iron or from iron to copper, in verifica
 tion of a theoretical conclusion mentioned above : but I intend
 shortly to extend the verification of theory to a demonstration that
 reverse effects take place between those metals at a temperature
 above their neutral point of about 280° Cent. ; and I hope also to
 be able to make determinations in absolute measure of the amount
 of the Peltier effect for a given strength of current between various
 pairs of metals.
    With reference to laws of electromotive force in various cases, I
 have commenced by determining the order of several specimens of           3.
 metals in the thermo-electric series, and have ascertained some very
 curious facts regarding varieties in this series which exist at different
 temperatures.     In this I have only followed Becquerel's remarkable
 discovery, from which I had been led to the reasoning and experimental
 investigation regarding copper and iron described above.        My way
 of experimenting has been to raise the temperature first of one
junction as far as the circumstances admit, keeping the other cold,
 and then to raise the temperature of the other gradually, and watch
 the indications of a galvanometer during the whole process. When
 an inversion of the current is noticed, the changing temperature is
 brought back till the galvanometer shows no current; and then (by
 a process quite analogous to that followed by Mr. Joule and Dr.
 Lyon Playfair in ascertaining the temperature at which water is of
 maximum density) the temperatures of the two junctions are ap
 proximated, the galvanometer always being kept as near zero as
 possible.    When the difference between any two temperatures on
 each side of the neutral point which give no current is not very great,
their arithmetical mean will be the neutral temperature. A regular
deviation of the mean temperature from the true neutral tempera
ture is to be looked for with wide ranges, and a determination of it

cific heat of electricity in the two metals varies with the tempera

    The conclusion    as regards specific heats of electricity in the dif
ferent   metals,   from the equation expressing thermo-electric force
given above, is that the specific heat of vitreous electricity is greater
in each metal passing another from left to right in the series as the
temperature rises than in the metal it passes: thus in particular
    The specific heat of vitreous electricity is greater in copper than in
platinum or in iron; greater in brass than in platinum or in lead; and
greater in lead than in platinum,                         tº 1, o' mo<U+017F>t, ºr
    It is probable enough from the results regarding iron, and coppe
mentioned above, that the specific heat of vitreous electricity is
positive in brass; very small positive, or else negative, in platinum,
perhaps of about the same value as in iron. It will not be difficult to
 test these speculations either by direct experiment on the convective
 effects of electric currents in the different metals, or by comparative
 measurements of thermo-electric forces for various temperatures, in
circuits of the metals, and I trust to be able to do so before long-soº

   Having recently been occupied with an extension of the mechani
cal theory to the phaenomena of thermo-electricity in crystalline
metals, I have been led to experimental investigation on this branch
of the subject. The difficulty of obtaining actual metallic crystals
of considerable dimensions made it desirable to imitate crystalline
structure in various ways.      The analogies of the crystalline optical
properties which have been observed in transparent solids, in a state
of strain, and of the crystalline structure as regards magnetic induc
tion which Dr. Tyndall's remarkable experiments show to be pro
 duced not only in bismuth but in wax, thick paste of flour, and “the
 pith of fresh rolls,” by pressure, made it almost certain that press

then it is clear that the quantic is reduced to zero by each of the ope
rations of the entire system, but this property is not by any means
confined to the quantic; and any function having the property in
question, i. e. every function which is reduced to zero by each ope
ration of the entire system, is said to be a covariant of the quantic.

  pressed portions: still both sets enter the object-glass. But on trans
  mitting oblique light through the object, one set of the rays will be
  refracted so as not to enter the object-glass, whilst the other set will
  gain admission; thus the two parts, which have differently refracted
  the rays, will become distinct.    If the markings were more delicate,
  or if the difference between the refractive power of the two portions
  of the valve were less, both sets would enter the object-glass.” But
  on rendering the light still more oblique, one set would be again
  excluded by being refracted out of the field.” Hence it is evident
  why the angular aperture of the object-glass must be larger as

  bf the light requisite will be very great to cause the exeldsien
  of one set of the rays, and the other set will be too oblique<U+017F> to
  enter the object-glass unless it be of correspondingly large aperture:
  This is the explanation of the advantage of oblique light:º it has
  no peculiar power of rendering objects distinct, as has sometimes
 been believed, and the following experiment, supposed to show such
 peculiar power, is really to be explained on different grounds. e. A
 piece of net, or some similar texture, is placed behind a hole made in
 a window-shutter; and when thus viewed, theºfibres are notawell
 seen; but when the texture is moved ontone side, they become very
 distinctly visible, and this has been erroneously attributed to the
 illumination by oblique light; whereas the increased distinctness in
 the lateral position is owing principally to the cireumstance that
 the object is then viewed on a dark instead of a white ground as in
 the first instance; although it is also true that in this position the
 oblique rays, being reflected in large numbers from the fibres into
 the eye, contribute to the distinct vision of the object when viewed
 as it then is upon a dark ground. 29    ºf   3d 919::

 collected that the additional rays admitted by the phject-glass of largée

enter the object-glass and will illuminate the more highly refractive,

illumination of the other is not increased. In short; the object is

object-glass of small aperture; and, secondly, by the additional rays,

various parts of the depressed and undepressed portions would be
equally recognizable in both cases.
   This is also true of fine lines scratched or etched on glass; for
although the coarser lines upon glass micrometers are well seen with
an object-glass of small aperture with good defining power and
direct light, yet the finest lines upon Nobert's test-slide require
penetrating power in the object-glass, and oblique light. Large an
gular aperture or penetrating power is but a very imperfect substitute
for defining power—an important point which the author believes has
not hitherto been noticed, and to which he would invite the earnest
attention of object-glass makers.
   The author concludes by observing that his remarks have been
principally confined to one class of objects requiring penetrating
power, viz. the valves of the Diatomaceae.    This has been done ad
visedly, because the scales of insects, which may be regarded as form
ing the type of the other class, involve considerations of a mixed
kind, which would have tended to confuse the subject. The longi
tudinal ridges upon the scales of insects, in their relation to pene
tration, may be viewed as representing the undepressed portions of
the valves of the Diatomaceae; and the same explanation will apply
to the visibility of both under various conditions.      The transverse
lines seen upon the scales are not indications of true structure; but
their origin, as also that of the lines seen upon the valves of the
Diatomaceae,   from circular or angular depressions, does not come
within the conditions involved in the principle which it has been the
object here to elucidate.    It will suffice to say that the true struc
tures producing the appearance of transverse markings upon the
scales of insects are best resolved by small angular aperture and good
definition.
   It has been assumed also, that the markings upon the valves of
the Diatomaceae arise from depressions.       This can be proved to be
the case in the larger ones (Isthmia, &c.); and there is sufficient
 evidence to render it at least highly probable in the remainder.   But
this is an unessential point as regards the principle, and therefore it
has not been dwelt upon.

resulting from the shock of two opposing liquid veins. In this case,
though the forces are in opposite directions, motion is not annihi
lated; but the liquid, as first shown by Savart, spreads out so as to
form a thin transparent film, the plane of which is at right angles to
the direction of the jets. By varying the pressure on one side or
the other, or by making the jets of different diameters, the plane
film could be converted into a curved one, and sometimes actually
caused to close, so as to form a pellucid sack. A cistern, situated
at the top of the house and communicating by pipes with the lecture
table, placed a considerable pressure at the disposal of the lecturer,
and enabled him to exhibit in a striking manner the various phaeno
mena described by Savart in his researches on the motion of liquids.
A vein was caused to fall vertically upon a brass disc upwards of
3 inches in diameter: the liquid spread laterally on all sides and
formed an umbrella-shaped pellicle of great size and beauty. With a
disc of an inch in diameter, a pellicle of at least equal magnitude was
formed.    When a candle was placed underneath the curved sheet of
water a singular effect was produced. The film above the candle
was instantly dissipated; and on moving the candle,           motion was                 its

   I have also shown how, with fluids and platinum or charcoal with
out an alkaline solution, we may succeed in obtaining piles with a
constant current. I conclude my memoir by showing fully the evo
lution of electricity in the combustion of gases or of charcoal. I
had already taken up this question in 1824, by means of the con
densing electrometer and plates of platinum; a year afterwards
M. Pouillet analysed these effects, especially those produced by the
combustion of charcoal.     Having already proved that during the
contact of the flames with the plates of platinum thermo-electrical
effects were produced, I again went over                my experiments      all  1849,                                in

with         bases.
     8.      Acids when combining                      or   mixing with each other behave                              so   that

the most oxidizing acids are the most electro-positive; in combination
with bases they appear to retain the same property, so that in the reac
tion or mixture of saturated solutions of two neutral salts, the nitrate is
positive in relation to the sulphate, the sulphate to the phosphate, &c.
     9. When several acid, neutral, or alkaline solutions are placed
side by side so as to mix slowly, the electrical effects produced are
the sum of the individual effects which take place at each surface
of contact.
      10. Contrary to Volta's opinion, an electric circuit, or rather a closed
circuit, may be formed entirely with liquids in which a current of elec
tricity circulates, and from which phaenomena of decomposition and
recomposition are produced, if there exist in this circuit corpuscles
which are conductors of electricity.                Living organized bodies present
numerous        examples      of circuits of this kind, capable of giving rise to
electro-chemical effects which have not yet been studied.—Comptes                          -

of the syringe, both to aid the holding of the clamp and to be
ready to obviate the consequences of any accidental detachment.
When the cold of evaporation or other indications prepare us to
expect a very dry air, it is best to begin from the first with a
pretty quick action of the piston, so as to secure a good reduc

84                  Prof. A. Connell on            a new Hygrometer
        I
still think it much better to continue it of the size formerly                     I
mentioned, unless more extended observation shall show the
propriety of further enlargement.
   The expenditure of aether during the exhaustion is very small,
being on an average about half a drachm, value from a halfpenny
to a farthing. With the dew-point only 5° or 6°below the tem
perature of the air,          I
                       have obtained the required reduction with
the  expenditure of only one-tenth of a drachm. When the ob
servation is completed, the residual aether is immediately poured
back into a separate little bottle kept for the purpose, and well
stopped, and it may be used again repeatedly, making it up each
time to 3 drachms by adding fresh aether from another bottle in
so far as necessary.           I have used the same aether in this way for
a week or two; but            of course this ought not to be persevered in
too long; and entirely fresh aether ought to be employed after
a certain time, and preserved, as before, till no longer proper for
TuSe.
    After the instrument has been used and the residual aether
poured back, it is expedient to work the piston a few times
backwards and forwards to expel residual aether or its vapour.
The leather of the piston should be rubbed from time to time
with olive oil, and care should be taken that the washers of the
different screws do not become too dry. This is prevented by
the occasional use of olive oil; and this is one of the first things
to be looked to at any time the instrument may seem not to
work well.
   As there naturally will be a disposition to compare the indi
cations of this instrument with those of other dew-point hygro
meters, particularly with those of Professor Daniell’s, I beg to
offer a few observations with reference to such a comparison.

             have agreed     admiring the beauty and elegance

XII.   Reply to some Observations published by Mr. Wilbraham in
   the Philosophical Magazine, vol. vii. p. 465, on the Theory of
   Chances developed in Professor Boole's ‘Laws of Thought.”
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
Conrºy
       GENTLEMEN,
                          is in every way so disagreeable to me, that
        it is with the most unfeigned reluctance            feel myself  I
called upon to reply to the observations of Mr. Wilbraham                                    in
serted in the last Number of your Journal.
   Mr. Wilbraham states that it is his object “to show that
Professor Boole does in the greater number of questions rela
ting to chances solvable by his method (or at least in those which
are most difficult to treat by other methods), tacitly assume cer
tain conditions expressible by algebraical equations, over and
above the conditions expressed by the data of the problem, and
to show how these conditions may be algebraically expressed.”
And in a subsequent passage he describes the procedure of that
part of my work on the Laws of Thought which relates to the
theory of probabilities, thus:—“In cases not determinable by
ordinary algebra, his (Professor Boole's) system is this; he takes
a general indeterminate problem, applies to it particular assump
tions not definitely stated in his book, but which may be shown,
as I have done, to be implied in his method, and with these
assumptions solves         that
                               it;    say,
                                      is

minate case        of  indeterminate problem, while his book may

                          making him suppose that          the general

                      But though might, think, justly complain           I
of the representations which Mr. Wilbraham has made,          very                                        I
gladly dismiss this part of the question, and desire to consider
simply whether Mr. Wilbraham's strictures affect in any way the
validity of the method which     have published.     I
                                                   Before entering
upon this inquiry, I would beg permission to state what is the
view which          I
               have been led to take of the theory of probabilities
as a science.
                        I
    It cannot, think, be doubtful that the theory of probabilities
belongs to that class of sciences which are termed pure sciences.
Its fundamental idea or conception is that of probability. From
this idea, from the definition of the measure of probability by
which it becomes associated with number, and from the laws
of thought with which it is connected through                 having      do              its                 to
with events capable            logical expression, flow the axioms and

                in

Mr. Cayley and myself. “The probabilities of two events A1,
A2 are c, and c2 respectively.     The probability that if AI present

I       would refer          on   these points          to   a    paper    “On       the conditions                 by

90              Prof. Boole on the Theory of Chances.
which the Solutions of Questions in the Theory of Probabilities
are limited,” which     I forward for publication with this letter.
On the other hand, there are no cases whatever in which the
problem is solvable by other methods, which do not furnish a
verification to the solution I have given. Now I cannot but
think that a cautious inquirer after truth, seeing that two hypo
theses (still adopting Mr. Wilbraham's language), one of which
appears to him “eminently anomalous,” conduct to a solution
which cannot by any known test be proved erroneous, while two
other hypotheses, which appear to him “perhaps not unreason
able” (for this, Mr.Wilbraham's language already quoted implies
with reference to Mr. Cayley’s hypotheses), conduct to a solution
which will not bear the test of examination, would be led to sus
pect that he had been judging of the reasonableness and of the
anomalous character of hypotheses by some false standard.        Of
course if a solution is erroneous, it need not to be argued that
there must be error in the hypotheses by which it was obtained.
But it is easy to show this directly. If we apply the second of
the equations representing Mr. Cayley’s hypotheses to the par
ticular case in which pi-1, p2=0, a case perfectly consistent
with the character of the original data, it will be found to lead
to the equation cle,   -0,  an equation not implied by those data
in the particular case contemplated.         On the other hand,    I
affirm without hesitation that there is no case in which the equa
tions deduced by Mr. Wilbraham from my method of solution
can be proved to be erroneous.       They do not, indeed, represent
“hypotheses,” but they are legitimate deductions from the general
principles upon which that method is founded, and it is to those
principles directly that attention ought to be directed.
   I  would request your readers to observe that I do not offer
the above remarks as affording any proof that the principles
upon which my method is established are true, but only as con
clusive that Mr. Wilbraham's objections against them, drawn
from what to him appears to be the anomalous character of an
equation to which they lead, are of no value whatever.       Nor is
it difficult to see what is the source of the erroneous judgements,
for erroneous     I cannot but term them, which Mr. Wilbraham
has been led to form. It is in a principle, the influence of which
appears to me to tinge the whole course of his speculations, that
those events which in the language of the data appear as simple
events, are the ultimate elements of consideration in the problem.
These are the elements in terms of which he expresses his equa
tions, overlooking the fact that it is by mere convention that such
elements are presented as simple, and that the problem might
have been expressed quite otherwise.         It cannot be too often
repeated that the distinction of simple and compound is wholly

92       Prof. Boole on the conditions by which the Solutions                         of
chances in which the data are not the probabilities of simple                              in
dependent events.         I
                      propose in this paper to develope an easy
and  general method of determining such conditions. This object
has been attempted in Chapter XIX. of my treatise on the ‘Laws
of Thought.” But the method there developed is somewhat dif
                                    I
ficult of application, and am not sure that it is equally general
with the one which I am now about to explain.        premise the            I
following proposition.                                    -
    Proposition.—To eliminate any symbol of quantity a from any
system of inequations in the expression of which it is involved.
   The general method will be best explained by an example.
Suppose it required to eliminate a from the inequations
                                a   +y–2               0
                               3y—w–2 > 0
                                w–2y+2 = 0.
Reducing each of these inequations to a form in which the first
member shall be w, we have
                                a   £2–y
                                a       ±   3y–2
                                a   £2/–2.
From these equations it appears that a has for a superior
limit 3y–2, and for inferior limits 2–y and 2/–2.         As the
superior limit must in general exceed each of the inferior limits,
we have                                     -
                       3y–2     2–y,              3y–2 5 2y–2,
whence
                               2y = 2             y=    x    0.
And these are the only conditions which are independent of w.
   The general rule would therefore be to seek from the several
inequations the superior and inferior limits of x, and then to express
by new inequations the conditions that each superior limit shall be
equal    is to,
             greater than, every inferior limit.
  If it  a or
            condition that              w    is        positive quantity, then must
each superior limit       be
                       made         :            0;a   or    we
                                                              might add   the system
                                                                                 to
ofinequations the inequation                 a    £0,       and apply the general rule.
   When several quantities,
                                                 a,
                                      &c., are
                                            as   y,  eliminated, we    to
                  by  eliminating                                  all be
can proceed     first                then from    w,the inequations
which either result      remain eliminating
                          or                   and      on.       y,        so
  It is obvious that the number       inequations  of
                                                   obtained     the                   by
elimination      symbol may greatly exceed that

  in what cases the problem becomes determinate in the sense above
  explained.   Thus in the particular problem discussed in Pro

  it follows that whenever one of the upper limits of w becomes
  equal to one of the lower, the other conditions remaining satisfied,
  the problem becomes determinate.       Thus, if we have psa O, we
  find from the above,
         w ºf   cipi       w ºf   1-ci<U+017F>1–pi)               w    1-ca         w   =   e,   pl.
  Now as w cannot at the same time be both greater and less than
  eipi, it must be equal to cºpy; the other conditions simply redu
  cing to 1—c., sº cipi. The solution, therefore, is
                                            w-ch     p1,

  , Let us apply to this case the solutions of the general question
  in probabilities respectively given by Mr. Cayley and myself.
  Mr. Cayley’s solution is expressed by the quadratic equation
 (l — c1(1-p)) —w)(1 –c.,(l-pa) —w) = (1–c.)(1—c.)(1—w).(11)
 If we      make paz 0, it becomes                                   *
         (1 — c1(1-p)) —w)(l — cº-w)=(1-c.)(1—c.)(1—w),
 and this equation is not satisfied when we make was cipi. The
 solution which I have given is contained in the quadratic equation
             (w—cipl)(w-cap2)(1—w)=                         (1 — c1(1-p)) —w)

 and    this equation,         on

                                                               is                by

that that equation will always furnish a single root satisfying the
two conditions
             w = 1-c.1(1-p))       wº: 1-c3(1-p);
but that the remaining three conditions assigned in (10) will not
be satisfied by it unless certain other conditions, distinct from
the conditions of possible experience, obtain.
   And this leads me to notice, in the last place, a remarkable
distinction, a posteriori, between                hypotheses in the
solution of questions in the theory of probabilities, and axiomatic
principles flowing out of the very idea and definition of proba
bility, or sanctioned by the laws of thought. It is that the latter
never impose, either upon the data or upon the solution, any
limitations but those under which alone experience is possible,
while the former do in general (always, I think, when the equa
tion of a solution rises above the first degree) impose such limi
tations.
   But these considerations only conduct us again to that general
view of the theory of probabilities which is contained in my reply
to the strictures of Mr. Wilbraham.      They confirm, so far as
they go, the doctrine already advanced, that         claim   rank           its             to
among the pure sciences must rest upon the degree    which                             in              it
satisfies the following conditions:—
   1st. That the principles upon which   methods are founded         its

               an axiomatic nature.
  2nd. That they should lead     results capable      to                      of       exact   verifi
cation, wherever verification possible.          is
   3rd. That they should    capable            be

that Mr. Adams had good reason for advising the Council not

                        arrived at an equation which will be very
frequently referred to in the course of this discussion, viz.
                        2        2                 1.2

I saw   at once that this equation, which, as      believe, had not      I
been previously noticed by any writer on the lunar theory, might
be employed in obtaining directly the true form of an approxi
mate value of the radius-vector.   The process for this purpose
will be considered in the course of the discussion.
    Ihave a few remarks to make on statements contained in
page 28 of Mr. Adams's letter, which refer to views expressed in
the introductory part of my paper.    My objections to the logic
of the process usually followed in the lunar theory are there
stated in these words:—“As it is certain that the mean motions
of the apse and mode are consequences of the sun's disturbing
force, there must be some direct means of deducing them from
the dynamical equations of the motion.      In fact, the method of
calculating the motion of the moon’s node in the third book of
Newton’s Principia shows, step by step, that the motion results
from the dynamical conditions of the problem, and in this respect
is logically more exact than the analytical method, which only
shows, on the hypothesis of such motion as Newton deduced,
that the dynamical equations are satisfied.   There must be some
hiatus in the analytical method which requires to be filled up in
order that the logic of the lunar theory may be free from
reproach.”    My paper supplied this defect in the case of the
mean motion of the node as well as in that of the apse, and by
processes analogous to each other, as                          I
                                            shall take occasion to
show hereafter.

our knowledge of the moon’s orbit.
    It will be proper to state here, also, my ideas respecting the
constants introduced by integration, when the solution of the
differential equations is only approvimate.             When an exact solu

                                    agree  with Mr. Adams that, provided
the    proper  number of constants be obtained, it matters not what
is the process of integration and how it is suggested, simply for
the reason that there is but one such solution, and                      form                       its            is
unique.     Also the constants are       arbitrary,   and therefore      entirely

the approximative process of integration made use of to obtain
the values of r and 6, does not decide whether or not the con
stants are mutually related, because it is conducted in an irregular
manner. After assuming that there is a mean motion of the
radius-vector, it makes the additional assumption of a mean
motion of the apse; whereas my method of integrating the equa
tions (1) and (2) to the first approximation deduces the mean
 motion of the apse from an assumed mean motion of the radius
 vector; and in the course of making this deduction, a certain
 relation between the constants h and C (which may replace a and
 e) is found which gives for e a special value.          The reasoning
 which leads to this result will be defended in a      subsequent   part
 of the discussion.

difficulty is only apparent, and admits of explanation. Mr. Adams
even volunteers to give an explanation, but, as might be ex
pected, is not successful.   He is equally unsuccessful in stating
the difficulty. In the quotation from my article, inserted towards
the bottom of page 32, the reference to the mean distance might
have been omitted without detriment to the conclusion, as may
be thus shown.     Put a for r in the small term of equation (C),

Mr. Adams goes on to obtain values of the apsidal distances by
an approximate solution of this equation. The process he adopts,
though conducted in an unusual manner, is nothing more than
the ordinary Newtonian method, applied to approximate to two
roots of an equation of four dimensions. On the reason for this
process he is quite silent. The roots being put under the form

     I come now   to an argument in which I admit that Mr. Adams
has taken a    right  view.     I attempted by reasoning conducted
verbally, to confirm the results of an analysis which stood in need
of no such confirmation.                          If
                                      that reasoning had been good, it
would have shown that the           eccentricity  is proportional to the
square of the ratio of the periodic times, and not, as stated in
Theorem II., simply proportional to that ratio.             am therefore                  I
thankful to Mr. Adams for          proving   that this verbal reasoning
was in fault.                                                      -
   The assertion in page 36, that “if the disturbing force were
increased the total fluctuation in the value of the radius-vector
would be the same as before,” begs the question at issue.              So

112    Methods    of preserving the Sensitiveness of Collodion Plates.
riments necessarily require     a more lengthened period than we
have at  present   been able to give, but as long as they have yet
been kept (upwards of three weeks), there has been no appear
ance of deterioration.
   Before the development, we find it advisable to moisten the
collodion film by immersion in the silver-bath for about half a
minute, as otherwise the pyrogallic acid or iron solution would
not flow evenly over the plate.      The fixing, &c. is of course con
ducted as usual.
   It will be as well to draw attention to a few points which,
although not absolutely essential, may possibly be found useful
in practice.   The glass plates should be cleaned with more care
than is necessary when they are to be used immediately; we
have found strong nitric acid applied with a tooth-brush most
convenient.    With regard to the collodion, we have tried very
many different samples, and with tolerably uniform success.
The greater number of our experiments have been made with a
tolerably thick collodion, the alcohol and aether of which were in
the proportion of 1:2, made sensitive with four grains of iodide
and half a grain of bromide of ammonium to the fluid ounce.
We have also employed a collodion containing iodide and bro
mide of cadmium with good success.
   Of the 30-grain silver solution for exciting the plate we have
only to recommend the use of acetic instead of mitric acid, to
give the bath that faintly acid reaction which is by some opera
tors considered desirable.
   There are one or two circumstances to be attended to in the
preparation of the magnesia-bath.        Commercial fused nitrate of
magnesia is very liable to contain chlorine, and also to have an
alkaline reaction on account of the fusion being carried too far.
Of course the quantities of acetic acid and nitrate of silver given
in the formula for the bath are on the supposition that the
nitrate of magnesia is pure; if this be not the case, it should be
rendered perfectly neutral with acetic acid, the chlorine exactly
precipitated with nitrate of silver, and then the proper amounts
of acid and silver added.      However, if the impurities are very
considerable, it will be safer to reject the salt at once.        This
bath will  keep  in  good  order for a long  time;  the only  point to
be attended to is to-drain the plates slightly after coming from
the silver-bath, and, if necessary, to remove the liquid from the
back with blotting-paper, so as to introduce as little silver as
possible into the nitrate of magnesia.       A solution of one grain
of silver to the ounce is quite sufficient to keep the plates sen
sitive; and when the strength rises, as it will in time, to above
a certain limit, the slight evaporation that always takes place
will render the silver solution sufficiently strong to dissolve off

the iodide in small holes. If this occur the bath can be restored
by nearly, but not quite, precipitating the silver with a solution
of chloride of magnesium, and then filtering.
   One of the most important things to be attended to is the
necessity of preserving the plates where they are perfectly free
from any light. It will be evident to all, that anything short of
                                                                                                             be its
absolute darkness, when the sensitive surface is exposed to
action for day after day, and perhaps week after week, must
fatal  to   its
             subsequent cleanliness.   The necessity      protecting                     for
the  plates from  any  deleterious gases, ammonia,  for instance,                                            is

             XVII. On the Law of Prime Numbers.
      By CHARLEs JAMEs HARGREAve, Esq., LL.D., F.R.S.*
    a paper written by me in the year 1849, and published in
IN the  Philosophical Magazine, vol. xxxv. p. 36, I attempted,
 by means of certain principles there laid down, to apply the pro
 cesses of analytical investigation to the theory of numbers; and
I  thereby arrived at certain conclusions relative to the occurrence
 of prime numbers in the ordinal series which were expressed in
 the following proposition:—“The average distance between two
 successive prime numbers at the point a in the ordinal series is
log w; and the average number of primes which may be expected
to occur between a and a' is the logarithm-integral of a between
those limits, or lia'—lia.”
    The nature and exact purport of this theorem will be readily
understood by any person who takes the trouble of counting the
number of primes between various limits, when he will discover
that, by taking ranges of sufficient magnitude, the rate at which
.
the primes occur appears to follow a very regular and uniform
law, though nothing can be apparently more irregular than the
particular places at which the individual primes are to be found.
    In the paper above alluded                   to,
                                       the law was verified for various
numbers under one       million;   and    was found that the formula
                                                       it
         produced the proper number          primes within very mode
                                                            of
rate limits       of
               error.
 I    propose     the present paper, first,
                   in                            make     further inves

but susceptible only           of
                          certain specified values.   The equivalent

of a similar problem, by Professor Tchebycheff of the University
of St. Petersburgh, which appeared in the Transactions of the
Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburgh, having been read before
that learned body in the month of May, 1848%.    In that memoir
the same   formula, lia, was arrived at by a process with which
the paper in the Philosophical Magazine has nothing in common;
and the formula was considered as denoting the limiting value
of the number of primes up to a, as a increases without limit,
rather than as being a mode of determining the average number
of primes between given limits.
   The results given in that paper, (to which, as being a novel
and highly ingenious mode of applying analysis to a question in
the theory of numbers, the attention of the reader is particularly
called), may be thus stated.   The author first demonstrates that

Thus learning 163,586 as the number of numbers whose lowest
prime factor exceeds 23.
   Using the second process for the primes above 23, we write
down the following table in two columns; the first contains the
quotients obtained by dividing a by the primes from 997 (the
next prime below wh) to 29, and the second contains the number
of primes between the divisor and the quotient. The first column
is obtained from a table of reciprocals, and the second column
from Barlow's table of primes, where they are in effect already
counted.

 122        Mr. C.          J.   Hargreave on            the   Law        of Prime                 Numbers.
    Of the above quotients, the last sixteen only are greater than
 the squares of their divisors.  We have therefore to divide each
 of these by  the primes commencing    with the divisor, and going
 on to the prime   next below the square  root of the quotient. The
 primes, counted as before from divisor to quotient, give the result
 of this part of the process as being 8664. These divisions pro
 duce only three instances in which the quotient exceeds the
 square of the divisor, and the repetition of the process upon these
 gives 8.  The result with reference to 1,000,000 is—
    No. of terms whose lowest prime factor exceeds 23                                                      163,586

silver   a   crystalline precipitate which dissolves in boiling water.
When this solution is allowed to cool, it forms a pasty mass,
which in course of time becomes converted into colourless cry
stals.  These crystals are a compound of quinine and nitrate of
silver; they are soluble only in 300 parts of cold water. Ana-
lysis leads to the formula             C*H*N*0*. Ag0.                        NO”.
  As                    of quinine, some chemists represent
         regards the equivalent
it by the formula C*H*NO”, whilst others think it is rather
C*H*N*O".        According to the first formula, neutral sulphate
of quinine is   C*H*NO’HO. S0°; and the other sulphate,
C19H4N4O4 HO. S0°, must be a basic sulphate.           According
to the second formula, it is the latter salt that is neutral, and
the sulphate C*H*NO” HO. S0° is an acid salt which ought
to be represented by the formula C*H*N*O42HO.2SO4.
   There are other chemists, again, who represent the equivalent
of quinine by C*H*NO”, but regard the molecule of this alka
loid as composed of two equivalents, or as C*H*N*04.
    From the facts hitherto known, there appeared to be no very
conclusive reasons for adopting one of these formulae in prefer
ence to the other, but I think that the following results will
enable us to settle the equivalent and molecule of quinine.
    A mixture of iodide of aethyle and quinine dissolved in aether
and left for a few hours, furnishes crystals which increase in
quantity with time.      These crystals dissolve with facility in
boiling water, and separate again on cooling, in the form of long
 acicular crystals arranged round a common centre.       They are
colourless, silky, and of a bitter taste; they lose no water at
 212°F., and fuse at a higher temperature without decomposi
 tion. The analysis of these crystals showed a composition ex
 pressed by the formula C*H*N*O*I, or in 100 parts,

   The watery solutions of these iodides are not precipitated by
ammonia, and only become turbid with a great excess of potash.
The precipitate thus obtained dissolves in boiling water, and the
solution gives crystals identical with the first; in fact, the iodide
is not decomposed by the potash, but it is insoluble in a solution
of that alkali. With oxide of silver, the solutions of these iodides
furnish iodide of silver, and the solution retains a very energetic
base; it rapidly absorbs carbonic acid from the air, and fur
nishes therewith crystals possessing an alkaline reaction.                   This
base, to which       I give the name of aethylo-quinine, may be ob
tained by evaporating the solution in vacuo, when it forms an
amorphous mass; it dissolves in alcohol, and is precipitated from
this solution by aether in colourless crystals.               It is decomposed
even     at a temperature of 348°F.              With this base       I have pre
pared the following salts:—
                           of
Neutral sulphate              aethylo-     - C44 H29 N2 O5  -  SO3

Platinum double salt .              .    .   C*H*N*O". Cl-HHCl·H2PtCl2.
    All the properties of these compounds show that aethylo-qui
nine belongs to the fourth class of Hofmann's bases; it is a base
corresponding with oxide of ammonium, NH4O. Quinine is
therefore a nitride base (of the third class), and contains in the
molecule C*H*N*O" three compound radicals.                            There is no
 doubt after this that the molecule and            equivalent    of quinine  must
be expressed by the formula C*H*N*O". As to the com
 pound radicals which enter into the composition of quinine, I
 should lose sight of the region of facts if I attempted to pro
nounce an opinion upon them.

the sum  in the left-hand member of the formula (54) reduces itself
to the term (efk): but such is also in this case the value of the
right-hand sum in the same formula, because in calculating that
sum we need attend only to the value h– k, if g be still =0.
In like manner, if f=0, each sum reduces itself to (egk); and if
e=0, the two sums become each = (fyk).           then any one of      If
these three indices, e, f, g, be =0, the formula (54) is satisfied:
which might indeed have been foreseen, by observing that, in
each  of these three cases, one factor of each member of the equa
tion (52) becomes = 1. We may therefore henceforth suppose
that each of the three indices, e, f, g, varies only from 1 to n,
or that
                      e          -

while k may still receive any value from 0 to n, and h still varies
in the summations between these latter limits: and thus the
number of equations, supplied by the formula (54), between the
constants (fgh), is reduced, as was lately stated, to (n + 1)n”;
while the number of those constants themselves had been seen
to be reduced to (n + 1)n”, by the same supposition to-1.

 ++(n”—n) associative and scalar equations of condition, between
the #(n°--n) disposable constants of multiplication, when the ge
neral conception of the polynomial expression Pof [1..]is modified
by the suppositions, to-1 in [2], and 's-Kw' in [5.]. At
least the analysis of the present paragraph [10] confirms what
has been lately proved in [9.], that the number of the conditions
of association can be reduced so far; but the same analysis will
also admit of being soon applied, so as to assist in proving the
existence of those additional and general reductions which have
been lately mentioned without proof, and which depress the
number .# conditions to be satisfied to #(n°– n°)         #(n°–n).                           –

dimension, between the symbols of the form (f/h). And with
out any such elimination, the formula (96) gives immediately
#n”(n-1)(n–2) other equations of the same kind between the
same set of symbols; because after choosing any pair of unequal
indices e and g, we may combine this pair with any one of the
n values of the index f, and with any one of the n–2 values of
k, which are unequal both to e and to g. There are therefore,
altogether, #n”(n+1)(n–2) homogeneous equations of the second
dimension, obtained by comparison of the vector parts of the
general formula of association, to be satisfied by the #nº(n-1)
symbols of the form (f/h).
    [15.] To prove now, generally, that when the vector parts of
the associative formula are thus equal, the scalar parts of the
same formula are necessarily equal also, or that the system of
conditions (56) in [9.] is included in the system (57) or (59);
we may conveniently employ the notations S and W, and pursue
the analysis of paragraph [10.], so as to show that the system
of equations (65), including (68), results from the system (67),
including (69); or that if the formula (84) be satisfied for every
set of three unequal or equal vector-units, t i<U+017F> ", then, for every
such set, the formula (89) is satisfied also.   For this purpose,   I
remark that the formula of vector-association (67), when com
bined with the distributive principle of multiplication [1], and
                           º
of operation with S and W [5.], gives generally, as in quater
nions, the transformation
                   WpWar-TSpa-a-Spr;          .  .   .  .   .  (101)
where p, q, r may denote any three vectors, and the symbol
WpWar is used to signify              the vector part of the product
px W(at); whence also we may derive by (41) this other general
 transformation,
                   V(Vat. p)=a Spr—TSpa.         .   .  .   .  (102)
 If then we write

 and introduce another arbitrary vector w, we shall have

of (65) on (67), or of (56) on (57), is therefore proved to exist;
and the #(n°–n) associative conditions, for which k=0 in (54),
are seen to be consequences of the #(n°–n”) other conditions
for which k > 0; or even of those conditions diminished in num
ber by #(n”—n), according to what was stated by anticipation
in [9], and has been proved by the analysis of [14]. This
result is the more satisfactory, because otherwise the conditions
of association would essentially involve a system of homogeneous
equations of the third dimension relatively to the symbols (fgh),
obtained by substituting in (56) the expressions (95) or (97) for
the symbols of the form (fg), including the values (98) of the

       GENTLEMEN,
        following notices of British species and their localities,
THEwhich     have not as yet found their way into our standard
works on mineralogy, may be interesting to a portion of your
readers.
     Ankerite.—For some years past                        I have   noticed on the boards
of the mineral dealers at Clifton ornamental specimens of iron
ore, which have been sold as the produce of the neighbourhood,
but which after considerable inquiry I find are brought from
Whitehaven to the ports of South Wales. They consist of sili
ceous ironstone covered with haematite, then coated with spe
cular iron, often of highly iridescent hues, with quartz almost
dodecahedral, or in which the prism planes are much reduced,
with a great variety of forms of carbonate of lime and what
appears to be brown spar. The latter, which has the curvilinear
faces common in this species, is sometimes dark brown and at
others of a nankeen-yellow with a wax-like surface.    On analysis
I generally find that this last consists roughly of about one-half
supposing either w=0, y=0, or t=0, w=0. Compare the equations (85)
or (86), which  are of the forms ta-0, ty=0, tz=0, ua =0, uy=0, uz=0,
va-0, vy-0, v2=0. In the theory of quines, however, the forms are not
quite so simple.                                                    -

carbonate     of lime, while the remaining portion is composed of
 the carbonates of iron, magnesia, and manganese in varying pro
portions.      In various pieces which have tried                  I
                                                                 have found                     I
upwards of 20 per cent. of carbonate of magnesia, and never,                                                       I
believe, less than 10; while the reaction for manganese with
 soda on platinum-foil, though interfered with by the tendency
 of the mineral to grow dark under the blowpipe flame, is still
very evident.              I
                      do not pretend to the last degree of accuracy
in these    examinations,   and when the acknowledged difficulties of
the   quantitative   determination of magnesia are considered, this
 will be excused. The analysis of carbonate of magnesia varies
much in different hands, as may be seen by reference to Brande ;
      I
and do not feel certain whether, in the combination with lime
and iron, the water should be regarded as an essential constituent.
 On the principle of carbonate of magnesia entering as an iso
morphic element into the union in question, should think not.                          I
By a reference to the analyses of foreign ankerite, it will be
noticed that while the carbonate of lime appears to be of nearly
uniform amount, agreeing almost exactly with my determination,
the quantities of carbonate of iron, magnesia and manganese,
which enter as isomorphic elements, are quite capricious, and all
my trials give results within the same limits.                There cannot,
therefore, be any doubt of the close agreement of the species.

   Silea.—From the table of a mineral dealer on Clifton Downs
I lately obtained a portion of a large ironstone nodule, coated
internally with quartz, which is concealed under an accumulation
of siliceous matter, whose form is unknown to me, but possesses
a characteristic structure, having much the appearance of antho
phyllite in this respect, a kind of indistinct radiating texture,
composed of extremely fine laminae in groups, and of a pinkish
hue.     It is composed almost wholly of pure silex, with traces of
iron and lime, and possibly alumina, which have not attempted                I
to separate from the iron, the former however so much in excess
as to render it probable that their presence is either accidental
or a mechanical admixture. The large nodule in which this is
contained is said to have been brought from the summit of
Broadfield Down, Somersetshire, where trap rocks make their
appearance at no great distance.      The quartz is so concealed by
or it,                                                                                                    or it,

 who were employed in them, makes it the duty of the person charged
 with their superintendence, to spare no pains to place before the
 Fellows, on suitable occasions, the results of researches designed to
 obtain a foundation of facts, on which a correct theory of the mag
 netic variations might be framed, and an insight be gained into the
 nature of the physical agency by which they are produced.
    “In this first stage of scientific inquiry, when we have only the
 phaenomena themselves to guide us in their classification, or to indi
 cate by apparent correspondences the existence of some causal con
 nexion of which we have no other knowledge than that which the
 observations themselves may afford, the first difficulty to be met
 consists, in disentangling from the complication in which the mag
 netic variations proceeding from different causes first present them
 selves, the effects which may appear to be due to certain amongst
 them; and in presenting    these in some methodical order or arrange
 ment, which may best assist the physicist or the mathematician in
 his conception of the problem or problems, to the solution of which
 he may desire to apply himself.
    “The first and most obvious separation of the magnetic variations
 is into those which are presented at one time at different parts of
 the earth's surface, and have special reference therefore to space; and
 those which present themselves at different times at one and the
 same place, and have special reference therefore to time.      It is the
 object of magnetic surveys to collect the facts of the first, and of
 magnetic observatories the facts of the second, of these primary divi
 sions. The present communication belongs to the second, and re
 gards the variations depending upon time at a single station (St.
 Helena).                                                                 -
    “Still, however, the phaenomena even at a single station are too
 complicated for ready comprehension, and stand in need of further
 subdivision.    This is most satisfactorily effected by the customary
 separation into three classes, or elements as they are frequently
 termed, the Declination, the Inclination, and the Intensity of the
Directive Force.     The discussion is limited on the present occasion
to a   single element,  the Declination, and to a portion only of the
results obtained   by the observations of that element at St. Helena.”
    After premising a description of the instrument with which the          t
observations were made, and of the mode of observing and of record
ing the observations, which is omitted here because it may be found
in the Introduction to the first volume of the ‘St. Helena Magnetical
 Observations,’ the author proceeds to the conclusions which he de
sires to notice, and to the manner in which these have been obtained,
which we follow, by adopting, as nearly as may be convenient, his
own words.
    “Before we attempt to examine those periodical variations, or
fluctuations about a mean value, which, from their having for periods,
for example, the solar year or the solar day, we naturally refer to
causes depending in some way upon the earth's place in its orbit re
latively to the sun, or to the earth's revolution round its axis, it is
desirable to examine, and if practicable, to eliminate the effects of a
variation which we have reason to believe belongs intrinsically to the

for each day. We are thus enabled to take in a more extended period,
amounting to ninety-six consecutive months, or eight years, from
which to derive the average rate of secular change at St. Helena.
Proceeding as before, we find for this period an average rate of 0-661
for the increase of West Declination in a month, or an annual                                                                                      in
crease of 7'-93 in a solar year.     During these eight years the hori
zontal magnetic direction at St. Helena had consequently changed
altogether rather more than one degree.
   “When the number of years are few from which an annual average
rate of secular change is derived, it is necessary to be particular in
regard to the regular distribution of the observations as to months
and hours, because observations made at one time of the year or at
one hour of the day, are not strictly comparable with those made at
other times of the year or at other hours of the day, unless indeed
corrections based on a long series of observations at the same spot
or in its vicinity are applied for the annual and diurnal variations.
But when the periods of comparison include intervals of consider
able length, the comparative influence of the annual and diurnal
variations is greatly diminished, and, if the comparison extend over

    “We have here then a striking example of the magnitude and
character of the changes wrought at a particular station by this very
remarkable feature of the earth's magnetic force.      In less than two
centuries and a half, the horizontal direction which a magnet takes at
St. Helena by virtue of the terrestrial magnetic force has been found
to have changed more than 30°, or more than a twelfth part of the
whole circle; and when we further examine the facts more closely,
we find reason to conclude that this great change has taken place
by a steady, equable and uniform progression throughout the whole
period.    The rate of annual change derived from the eight years
during which the observations were maintained by the detachment
of the Royal Artillery stationed at the Observatory (7'-93) differs so
slightly from that derived from the observations made at the anchor
age from the earliest period at which observations are recorded
(i.e. 8'05), that we may practically regard them as the same. To
examine whether this has been a uniform rate throughout the 236
years, or otherwise, the same calculation which gives 8'05 as the
most probable average rate of change between 1610 and 1846, will
give also for each of the years in which the Declination was observed
the most probable values of the Declination corresponding to the
same rate of change supposed uniform. These calculated values are
placed in the Table opposite to the years to which each belongs, and
adjoining the observed values. The differences are shown in the
next column.      On inspecting these, we perceive that not one of the
differences exceeds the limits, which, with a due consideration of the
irregularities to which magnetic observations made on board ship are
liable, may be ascribed to accidents of observation; and, what is still
 more important, that they fall indiscriminately to the east and to the
 west of the values calculated on the supposition of a uniform rate,
 and without the slightest appearance of any systematic character
 which might indicate that the rate had been otherwise than regular.
 We have reason to conclude, therefore, that, from the earliest date to
 which we can refer, the progression of secular change at St. Helena
 has gone on from year to year, as nearly as may be, in one uniform
 annual rate.
    “The instruction to be derived from the St. Helena observations
 does not however stop here.       By a suitable arrangement of the
 observations of the   eight years, they may be made to show that,
 when allowance is made for     comparatively  very small irregularities
 superimposed upon the regular march of the phaenomenon by dis
 turbing causes which will be treated of in the sequel, the average
 annual change takes place by equal aliquot portions in each month
 of the year. The eight years of observation commenced with June
 i841 : if we take a mean of the eight monthly means in the eight
 Junes from 1841 to 1848, we shall have a better assured mean value
 of the Declination corresponding to the month of June, than if we
 had confined ourselves to a single year. If we then do the same
 with the eight Julys, and with each of the other months in succes
  sion, we shall have twelve monthly values for a year commencing
 with June and ending with May, which will represent in a simple

144                                   Royal Society.
and condensed form the means of the whole eight years. . These are
exhibited in the next table, and we perceive at the first view that
the increase of west declination is progressive in each month, of the
year without a single exception.     If we desire to examine further
the degree of approximation which these values present to a progres
sion absolutely uniform, we may apply an aliquot portion of the an
                                                                                                                º

quot portions are shown in the second column, and it will be seen
by the third column, containing the mean declinations of the year
deduced severally from the observation-values in the different months,
with the correction for secular change assumed uniform applied, how
 very nearly the results derived from the several months approximate
 to one and the same value. The small differences which are shown
 in the last column are for the most part such as would probably dis
 appear by a longer continuance of the observations; but we may
 notice, by the character of the signs, that there is also visible amongst
 them the indication of a comparatively very small semi-annual affec
 tion, depending on the sun's position on either side of the equator,
 which will be reverted to when treating of superimposed effects.
    “The same features of regularity and uniformity are manifested if
the examination be further pursued into shorter periods, by comparing
with each other the twenty-six fortnightly means in the year; but
enough has been already stated to show the magnitude, the regula
rity, and the systematic character of the changes called secular,
which are thus produced by forces in constant operation at the sur
face of our planet.    In our entire inability to connect these changes
with   any  other of the phaenomena of nature, either cosmical or ter
restrial, we appear to have no other alternative than to view them as
a constituent feature of the terrestrial magnetic force itself, and as
         itsmost remarkable characteristics, not            overlooked by

change in the southern hemisphere from that in the northern, which
takes place in the opposite direction; whilst from the form of the
isogonic lines in that quarter, we may further anticipate that, at St.
 Helena, the secular change of the Declination will continue to take
place in the same direction as at present, until the line drawn through
the conical summits of the isogonic curves shall in its western pro -
gress pass the geographical meridian of that station.”
    The author then proceeds to the Variations which are found to
take place in periods corresponding to a solar year and a solar day;
 a correspondence which, he remarks, “enables us to recognize a phy
sical connexion, although we are still uncertain as to the mode of
operation between cause and effect. A correct knowledge of the
phaenomena themselves is the surest guide to a correct judgement
amongst the many theories which have been propounded in anticipa
tion of that knowledge; and I have therefore taken this opportunity
of bringing before the Society a careful analysis of the primary an
nual and diurnal variations at St. Helena attributable to solar influ
ence, in the belief that they will be found to place in a very distinct
light some points which are important to be kept in view in framing
or in judging of such theories.”      For this purpose diagrams were
exhibited, representing on a large scale the mean diurnal variation
of the Declination at St. Helena in the different months of the year,
and the annual variation at each of the twenty-four hours, both de
rived from the mean of five years of hourly observation; the secular
change having been previously eliminated, these diagrams were re
garded by the author as exhibiting what might be considered as
typical views of the annual and diurnal variations, correct in their
relations to the mean Declination in the year, or to the arithmetical
mean of all the hourly observations in the year, taken as zero. As
on the first aspect the diurnal phaenomena in the several months are
seen to separate themselves into two groups, having the equinoxes
as at least approximate epochs of separation, the months in which
the sun is north of the equator were coloured red, and those in which
he is south of the equator were coloured blue.
    Having in these diagrams the conjoint representation of two
distinct classes of phaenomena, a diurnal variation in each of the
months, and an annual variation at each of the hours, the author
proceeded to treat of each of these variations separately, commencing
with the annual, which he illustrated by taking the hour of 7 A.M.
as an example, and (referring to the diagram) showing the order
and succession of the several months in the annual cycle at that
hour, which are as follows:—in April the mean declination is about
half a minute east of the mean declination in the year; in May about
2' east; in June about 2% east; in July and August, when the
sequence is slightly irregular, respectively 2' 1 and 2' 6 east; in Sep
tember the declination is again approaching the mean line, being
less than 1% east of
                     it;   inOctoberit  has passed the mean line, being
about 1'; west of it; November, December, January and February
are congregated near the western extremity      of   the annual range,
whilst in March we perceive that the declination     isagain approach

ing the mean line, and in April it has     passed to the east of the mean
line. “We have       here, then,”  the author proceeds, “in the success
ive   changes  of the declination in the course of the year, the general
fact of the existence of an annual variation, of which, at the solar hour
of 7 A.M., selected as an example, or when the sun is five hours east
of the meridian, the phaenomena are such as have been thus cursorily
described. Were there no annual variation at that hour the different
months would all have the same mean declination, and the extended
figure, which in the diagram represents the annual cycle, would
be concentrated into one point.        The annual variation differs con
siderably at the different hours; but it is a general feature amongst
them that the months on either side of the one solstice are either
congregated together towards one extremity of the annual range
at the hour, whilst the months on either side of the opposite sol
stice are similarly congregated at the opposite extremity, or the
months of both solstices are contemporaneously in pretty rapid
transition from the one extremity to the other. It is this annual
variation which has been overlooked in the supposition entertained
by a very eminent authority, that in the vicinity of the equator the
magnetic direction would be found to be constant at all hours of
the day and night. If we group together the monthly means of
each period of six months separated by the equinoxes, we have
two semiannual mean lines, each differing comparatively very
slightly from any one of the months of which it is composed, but
the two differing very greatly from each other, and both differing
very considerably from the mean diurnal march in the year.               If
the latter line, viz. the mean diurnal march in the year, be projected
as a straight line, as is done in the zero-line of fig. 1 in the annexed
woodcut, the semiannual groups take respectively the forms exhibited
in that figure, the continuous line being the semiannual march in the
half year when the sun is north of the equator, and the dotted line
the semiannual march when the sun is south of the equator.            It is
in this form that the phaenomena of the annual variation in different
 parts of the globe may be most advantageously compared with each
 other.    Fig. 2 represents the analogous phaenomena at Toronto in
 43° north, and fig. 3 those at Hobarton in 43° south latitude. The
semiannual groups at Toronto and Hobarton have been obtained in
 precisely the same manner as those at St. Helena; the scale is the
 same in the three figures, i. e. 5 of an inch to 1'0 of Declination,
 the dotted and continuous lines refer respectively to the same periods
 of the year, and the zero line is in each figure the mean diurnal
 variation in the year at the station.
    “In viewing these three figures, it is scarcely possible to doubt that
 they represent substantially the same phaenomenon.           The magni
  tude and inflexions of the curves are not indeed     identical, but they
  approach so near to it that we may well suppose the small differ
  ences to be very minor modifications which will some day receive
  their explanation.    It will be remarked that during the hours when
  the sun is above the horizon and the effects are greatest, the corre
  spondence of the phaenomena at the three stations is most striking,

        clination is easterly of the mean in the forenoon and westerly in the
        afternoon when the sun is north of the equator, and the reverse
        when the sun is south of the equator.      The effects are the same at
        the three stations, though in the one hemisphere the sun being
   ... north of the equator corresponds to summer, and in the other hemi
        sphere to winter; whilst in the tropics this distinction of seasons
        -
        almost ceases to be sensible, and the epochs of maximum and mini
        mum of temperature do not correspond with either of those of the
       extra-tropical stations. The phaenomena thus represented embrace
       above 86° of latitude, presenting not only almost extreme contem
       poraneous diversities of climate, but also not less remarkable diver
       sities of absolute dip, declination and magnetic force.
           “No doubt can, I apprehend, be entertained that the annual
--variation which is here represented, is attributable, primarily, to the
       earth's revolution round the sun in a period of the same duration
       and in an orbit inclined to the equator.    But in what way, it may be
       asked, does the sun superimpose upon the earth's magnetism this
       comparatively small but systematic magnetic variation ?         The simi
       larity of effect, amounting almost indeed to identity at the hours
       when the sun is above the horizon of the station, taking place at
       stations where both the climatic and the terrestrial magnetic con
N      ditions are so dissimilar, seems to remove it altogether from those
      physical connexions, which have so often and in so many various
       ways been referred to as affording possible explanations of the mag
      netic variations.     In this difficulty some assistance may perhaps be
      afforded   by  examining    more closely, by means of the St. Helena
      observations, the    epochs  when the phaenomena of one of the semi
      annual groups passes into the very dissimilar phaenomena of the
      other semiannual group.          This has been stated to take place
      approacimately    at the equinoxes.     The approximation, particularly
      at the September equinox, is very distinctly and definitely marked.
*-    The day of the equinox is the 21st of September; if a mean be
--    taken of the diurnal march in the three weeks from the 1st to the
      21st of September, the line which represents it scarcely differs
      sensibly at any hour of the twenty-four from the mean line of the pre
      ceding half-year, taken from the 22nd of March to the 20th of Sep
      tember; thus showing that the phaenomena of that semiannual group
      are unchanged up to the time of the equinox.         If in the same way a
            mean   be taken           of the diurnal march in the three weeks following the
            21st of September, the line which represents them shows that the
|           passage from the phaenomena of one semiannual group to those of the

                         of

   “At the March equinox the commencement of the change is
equally definite: no trace of change can be discovered in the mean
from the 1st to the 20th of March, when compared with the mean
of the six months from the 22nd of September to the 20th of March;
the change then commences, but from some cause not yet apparent,
the conversion from the phaenomena of the one half-year to those of
the other is effected less rapidly at this than at the September
equinox. The mean of the month of April retains the distinct traces
of the group which it has quitted, and is in fact a month of transition
between the two groups, but in May the conversion is quite com
plete; the     phaenomena of that month have no characteristic distin
guishable from those of June, July and August.
    “From what has been stated in the preceding paragraphs, it will
be evident that the epochs of the sun's passage of the equator have a
very marked influence on the phaenomena under consideration, and
that the influence is the same and produces similar effects whether
the station itself be north or south of the equator, and however                                                   di

work of the osmotic force to be discussed.
   As diffusion        always
                      is            double movement—while salt diffuses

                                                                            of

of  salt, while the water entering the osmometer often exceeds the
salt leaving    it,   atleast one hundred times.          Diffusion      therefore              is
quite insufficient       to
                         account for the water current.
   The theory which refers osmose              capillarity appears

rectly observed; and many              the saline solutions which        give   rise
to  the greatest osmose are undistinguishable              ascension from pure
                                                                           in

   Two series       ofexperiments                on
                                           osmose were described, the first
 series made with the use           porous
                                    of       mineral septa, and the second
series with animal membrane.             The earthenware osmometer con

  sisted of the porous cylinder employed in voltaic batteries, about
  5 inches in depth, surmounted by an open glass tube 0-6 inch in dia
  meter, attached to the mouth of the cylinder by means of a cap of
  gutta percha.     In conducting an experiment the cylinder was filled
  with  any  saline solution to the base of the glass tube, and immediately
  placed in a large jar of distilled water; and as the fluid within the
  instrument rose in the tube, during the experiment, water was added
  to the jar so as to prevent inequality of hydrostatic pressure. The
  rise (or fall) of liquid in the tube was highly uniform, as observed
  from hour to hour, and the experiment was generally terminated in
  five hours.    From experiments made on solutions of every variety of
  soluble substance, it appeared that the rise or osmose is quite insig
  nificant with neutral organic substances in general, such as sugar,
  alcohol, urea, tannin, &c.; so also with neutral salts of the earths
  and ordinary metals, and with chlorides of sodium and potassium,
  nitrates of potash and soda and chloride of mercury.          A more sen
  sible but still very moderate osmose is exhibited by hydrochloric,
  nitric, acetic, sulphurous, citric and tartaric acids. These are sur
  passed by the stronger mineral acids, such as sulphuric and phos
  phoric acid and sulphate of potash, which are again exceeded by
  salts of potash and soda possessing either a decided acid or alkaline
  reaction, such as binoxalate of potash, phosphate of soda and car
  bonates of potash and soda.        The highly osmotic substances were
  also found to act with most advantage in small proportions, pro
  ducing in general the largest osmose in the proportion of one-quarter
  per cent, of salt dissolved.     Osmose is eminently the phaenomenon
  of weak solutions. The same substances are likewise always che
  mically active bodies, and possess affinities, which enable them to
  act upon the material of the earthenware septum.            Lime and alu
  mina were accordingly always found in solution after osmose, and
  the corrosion of the septum appeared to be a necessary condition of
  the flow.    Septa of other materials, such as pure carbonate of lime,
  gypsum, compressed charcoal and tanned sole-leather, although not
  deficient in porosity, gave no osmose, apparently because they are
  not acted upon chemically by the saline solutions. Capillarity alone
  was manifestly insufficient to produce the liquid movement, while
   the vis motrir appeared to be chemical action.           i<U+017F> ºri is , ºn
     The electrical endosmose of     Porrett, which has  lately been defined
  with great clearness by Wiedemann, was believed to indicate the
  possession of a peculiar chemical constitution by water, while liquid,
  or at least the capacity to assume that constitution when polarized
  and acting chemically upon other substances.          A large but variable
  number of atoms of water are associated together to form a liquid
  molecule of water, of which an individual atom of oxygen, stands
  apart forming a negative or chlorous radical, while the whole remain
  ing atoms together are constituted into a positive or basylous radical,
, which last will contain an unbalanced equivalent of hydrogen giving
  the molecule basicity, as in the great proportion of organic radicals.
º Now it is this voluminous basylous radical that travels in the elec
  trical decomposition of pure water, and resolves itself into hydrogen

  acids, and alkalies, when in solution, are chemically combined with
*much water of hydration, sulphuric acid for instance evolving heat

 different on the substance of the membrane, at its inner and outer
 surfaces, to induce osmose; and according to the hypothetic view
 which accords best with the phaenomena, the action on the two sides
 is not unequal in degree only, but also different in kind. It appears
 as an alkaline action on the albuminous substance of the membrane,
 at the inner surface, and as an acid action on the albumen at the
 outer surface. The most general empirical conclusion that can be
               is,                                                                           on

   The osmotic action of carbonate of potash and other alkaline salts
is interfered with in an extraordinary manner by the presence of
chloride of sodium, being reduced almost to nothing by an equal
proportion of that salt. The moderate positive osmose of sulphate
of potash is converted into a very sensible negative osmose by the
presence of the merest trace of a strong acid, while the positive
osmose of the first-mentioned salt is singularly promoted by a small
proportion of an alkaline carbonate. The last statement is illustrated
by the following observations:—

     It may appear to some that the chemical character which has
been assigned to osmose takes away from the physiological interest
of the subject, in so far as the decomposition of the membrane may
appear to them to be incompatible with vital conditions, and that
osmotic movement must therefore be confined to dead matter. But
such apprehensions are, it is believed, groundless, or at            events pre           all
mature.      All parts       living
                                 of   structures are allowed               state      to   be   in    a

                             BY A. BRAUN.
   T is well known that the calamine hills of Rhenish Prussia and
     the neighbouring parts of Belgium possess a peculiar flora; visi
tors to these regions are particularly surprised by a species of violet
allied to Viola tricolor, which unfolds its beautiful yellow flowers in
uninterrupted profusion from spring until the end of autumn, and is
known in the neighbourhood of Aix as the Calamine violet, or in
the dialect of the district “Kelmesveilchen.” This plant has been
described by Lejeune in his “Revue de la Flore de Spaa" as a
distinct species under the name of Viola calaminaria, but he has
since characterized it (Comp. Florae Belgica) as Viola lutea, Smith.
Koch and other authors have also rightly considered it as a variety
of V. lutea, Smith (grandiflora, Huds.), a species principally distin
guished from V. tricolor by                        its
                                   filiform subterraneous runners, by

the molecule of acid, I undertook a series of experiments to deter
mine the true formula of tannic acid; of these I now lay the results
before the Academy.                                                 -
   To obtain tannic acid in a pure state, I purified the acid prepare
by the method of M. Pelouze, in two ways; one portion was dis
solved in pure aether and the solution precipitated by water, the
other portion was dissolved in water and precipitated by aether.
Under these conditions two or three distinct strata are obtained, of
which the heaviest consists of tannic acid, dissolved in the aetherial
fluid.    This syrupous liquid was dissolved in water and then evapo
rated in vacuo; the residue was analysed after being dried at 248°F.
Ten analyses made with oxide of copper in a current of oxygen gas
upon substances obtained at seven different preparations, gave results
leading to the formula C*H* O*.

acid and glucose may be                    represented by the following equation:—
             C54 H22       O3++8HO=3(C14 H6 Oro) + Clº                                H10 O10.
This equation is confirmed by the quantities of the two compounds
obtained by the decomposition of tannic acid.      The former was
found to be 87 per cent. (maximum) by Wetherill; of glucose I
have obtained as much as 22 per cent.
   The quantity of water which may be displaced by metallic oxide
in the molecule C*H* O* I have determined directly by digesting
tannic acid with oxide of lead, and the analysis of the neutral and
basic salts.    By the former method I found that the acid loses 4-4
per cent., or 3 equivs. of water, which is confirmed by the analysis
of the salts of lead prepared by precipitation, in which the compo
sition of the anhydrous acid is represented by the formula C94 H19 O31,
differing by 3 equivs, of water from the formula C*H* 084.              The
precipitates obtained by tannic acid and acetate of lead contain from
3 to 10 equivs. of oxide of lead, in proportion to C**. The analyses
of tannates made by Pelouze, Liebig, Berzelius, Mulder and Büchner,
agree with the new formula of tannic acid, if we suppose that some
salts do not lose           all
                        their water      212°F.,      that they were not
                                                          at                or
completely dried.
   According        Berzelius, tannic acid combines with sulphuric
                     to                                                                                     or

                      these cases precipitates are obtained which are
dissolved     the commencement, until the fluid contains an excess
             at
of  sulphuric     muriatic acid. These compounds are distinguished
                    or
from the conjugate acids,                     as
                                 the mineral acid can      separated there            be

shows that they are nothing but tannic acid imbued with the acid
liquor  in which they are deposited.          fact, this sulphuric tannin
                                                                 In

    from tannic acid, which has been acidulated with a mineral acid.
    The formation of a precipitate by a mineral acid in a solution of
    tannin is therefore perfectly conformable to the precipitation of the
:   same solution by chloride of sodium and other alkaline salts, and
    even by aether, and must be explained by a diminution of the solu
    bility of the tannin in consequence of the change in the solvent.

     XXIII.         On the Action of the Ferment of Madder on Sugar.

    a paper read before the Royal Society in 1852t, I have
IN given an account of the nature and results of the peculiar
process of fermentation which takes place in madder and                                               its
watery extracts, when exposed     moderate degree totempe

for a length of time in a warm place, signs of a more active
process of fermentation begin to show themselves, especially in
summer weather; bubbles of gas are given off, and a peculiar
smell is emitted, which, though disagreeable, cannot exactly be
called putrid. During this process, which is evidently one of
putrefaction in the stricter sense, the erythrozym loses    slimi                                                  its

                     the Ferment             of Madder     on Sugar,                         163
water to the solutions to be fermented, as                         I
                                                        found that the fer
mentation was much promoted by this addition.
     Most of my experiments were made with cane-sugar, but                                        I
have also subjected grape- and milk-sugar to the same process
of decomposition.            In operating on cane-sugar             proceededI
in the    following   manner.      The    sugar  having   been dissolved in
water,  I    added to the solution for every pound of sugar taken
about four quarts of the brown pulp, prepared as just described,
and a sufficient quantity of lime-water to change the colour of
the ferment from brown to dark purple, and to cause a slight
alkaline reaction in the liquid.             The whole having been well
mixed, was left to itself. The vessels which I employed for
conducting the operation in, were large earthenware mugs. In
warm summer weather, provided the quantity of materials taken
was not too small, the fermentation generally commenced on the
succeeding day.          A copious disengagement of gas took place,
and continued for a number of days.               The bubbles of gas, in
rising, formed, together with particles of ferment carried up by
 them, a thick scum on the surface of the liquid, resembling the
 froth on the surface of fermenting beer.             As far as the evolu
 tion of gas, however, was concerned, the action did not seem
 to be quite as energetic as would have been produced by the
 action of ordinary yeast on sugar.              During this stage of the
 fermentation a      slight   vinous odour    might   be perceived near the
 surface of the liquor.          After a few days the liquid began to
 acquire a decided acid reaction, which was first indicated by the
 colour of the ferment changing from purple to brown. Very
 soon litmus paper began to be strongly reddened by                       After   it.
 some time the disengagement                gas ceased, and the particles
                                               of                                                 of

                              to                     clear, yellowish, super

 natant liquid.       The latter, however,         standing exposed
                                                           on               the          to

                                wine from other sources, was, that                                             it
appeared        to     be

                                                                 of
micaceous scales, which gave the liquid when agitated the ap

pearance of being traversed with silky bands.     On filtering,
these scales remained on the filter, but their quantity was so
insignificant that they could not again be separated from the
paper.
     The liquid remaining in the retort after the second distillation
was added to that remaining after the third distillation, and
evaporated together with an excess of carbonate of soda until
the bulk was very much diminished. The liquid was then su
persaturated with sulphuric acid and distilled. The distillate
was colourless, but had a strong acid taste and reaction. It was
 neutralized with carbonate of soda, and then gave on evaporation
 a crystalline mass, which was white with a brownish tinge. This
 mass, when treated with boiling dilute sulphuric acid, evolved a
 pungent smell like that of acetic or formic acid.       Its watery
 solution gave reactions similar to those of formiate of soda.    It
 gave, for instance, with nitrate of silver a white crystalline pre
 cipitate, which soon became black when left to stand, but imme
 diately on boiling the liquid; with protonitrate of mercury, a
 white crystalline precipitate, which on standing was slowly re
 duced to gray metallic mercury; and with corrosive sublimate it
 produced, on boiling, a copious deposit of white crystalline scales
 (calomel).   But on adding acetate of lead, evaporating to dry
ness, and treating the residue with alcohol, no crystals of for
miate of lead were left undissolved.                I
                                          therefore concluded that
the salt consisted for the most   part of acetate of soda, contami
mated with some     impurity,  which obscured the reactions proper
to acetic acid.   Whether the acetic acid thus obtained is a pro
duct of the direct action of the ferment on sugar, or whether it
is formed indirectly from the oxidation of the alcohol produced
in the first instance, is uncertain. The greater part of the acid

solution of the acid gives the following reactions. On adding
lime-water until the solution is alkaline, no precipitate is pro
duced.      On boiling, a very slight flocculent deposit is formed.
The filtered solution leaves on evaporation a crystalline mass,
which dissolves again for the most part in boiling water, leaving
undissolved only a small quantity of carbonate of lime. The
filtered solution is neutral to test-paper, and on being again
evaporated, leaves a quantity of long white needles, consisting,
without doubt, of the lime salt.          The taste of these crystals is
nauseous.     When heated in a      glass  tube they become black and
give fumes, but no crystalline sublimate; the residue dissolves
in acids, with effervescence, leaving some carbon undissolved.
On adding baryta water to the watery solution of the acid, there
is formed immediately a white flocculent precipitate, which is
soluble in muriatic acid, and is again formed on neutralizing the
acid with ammonia.           Perchloride of iron gives no precipitate
in the watery solution of the acid, but in the solution of the
lime salt it gives a copious light brown precipitate. Acetate of
lead gives immediately a slight flocculent precipitate. If the
liquid be filtered from this precipitate, and be allowed to stand
 for    day    two, there are formed                      on                                of

the lead was precipitated, and then filtered and evaporated.   A
sweet brown  syrup  was  left, consisting apparently of undecom
posed sugar, which, though allowed to stand for a length of time,
yielded no trace of anything crystalline.                 Part of this syrup
being redissolved in water, and the solution being again evapo
rated with the addition of acetate of zinc, no crystals were formed,
and the residue left after evaporation was completely soluble in
alcohol—a proof of the absence of lactic acid.
    The products resulting from this process of decomposition are
therefore the following:— carbonic acid, hydrogen, alcohol,
acetic acid, and succinic acid.           Of these the last-named is the
most remarkable; and                            its

170                   Dr. Schunck on the Action of
lead a pinkish-white precipitate, which seemed, however, to con
sist principally of carbonate of lead, as on treating a small quan
tity of it with nitric acid it dissolved with effervescence.            This
precipitate being decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen, and
the liquid being treated in exactly the same manner as that
resulting from the crude succinate of lead in the other experi
ments, a syrup was obtained, which yielded, however, not a trace
of crystalline sublimate when heated in a tube. The formation
of the succinic acid, as well as of the alcohol and the gases, is
therefore clearly due to the decomposition of the sugar induced
by the action of the ferment.
    Since madder itself contains a considerable quantity of sugar
ready formed, and an additional quantity is always produced by
the decomposition of rubian, it was natural to suppose that
watery extracts of madder might be found to contain succinic
acid.    For the purpose of ascertaining whether this was the case,
I  took some of the brown syrup which had been obtained by
extracting French madder with boiling water, precipitating the
colouring matter, &c. with oxalic acid, neutralizing the excess of
acid with carbonate of lime, and evaporating the filtered liquid,
which had been standing in the state of syrup for several years.
A quantity of this syrup having been mixed with water, added        I
to it acetate of lead, which produced a dark brown precipitate.
This precipitate being treated in precisely the same manner as
the lead precipitate thrown down by sugar of lead from the solu
tions of sugar fermented with erythrozym, yielded a small quan
tity of a white crystallized acid, which, when heated in a tube, was
completely volatilized, giving a beautiful crystalline sublimate,
exactly resembling that produced by succinic acid.         It is there
fore  very probable  that succinic acid is either contained as such in
madder, or is formed during or after the process of extraction by
the action of the ferment on the sugar contained in the extract.
    A few years ago the only known sources of succinic acid were
amber, turpentine, and some species of brown coal and retin
asphalt.    Latterly it has been discovered in several plants, such
as the Lactuca sativa and virosa”, and the Artemisia Absinthium-t,
and it has been detected in the liquid extracted from cysts con
taining Echinococci from the human liver<U+017F>.           It has moreover
been produced artificially by the action of nitric acid on different
kinds of fat and fatty acids, such as tallow, wax, spermaceti, and
stearic and margaric acids $; and          formation during the fer

cess has somewhat advanced, others when it approaches a con
clusion—these different effects corresponding to different stages
of decomposition in the ferment itself.     think am correct in                        I              I
saying that there are only two well-known instances of specific
effects due to ferments.   The one is the decomposition of amyg
daline (and salicine?) by means of emulsine, the ferment con
tained in almonds; the other the decomposition of rubian by
means of erythrozym.      No known ferment, with the exception
of emulsine,  has any effect whatever on amygdaline%, and none
of the usual ferments, such as yeast, decomposing caseine, albu
men, gelatine, or even emulsine, are capable of supplying the
place of erythrozym, as far as regards the decomposition of
rubiant. These specific effects of emulsine and erythrozym are
more characteristic  of these bodies than any other property
whatever, and serve to distinguish them from one another and
from other ferments, with more accuracy than any difference in
composition, however great.    On the other hand, the decompo
sition of sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid is an effect common
to          all
       known ferments.       All so-called proteine compounds, such
 as albumen, caseine, animal membranes, &c., when they enter
into decomposition, acquire the properties            ferments.    When                     of
in to all
    other circumstances are    alike,  the processes      decomposition                              of
    which these compounds, when acting              ferments, give rise                    as
    other bodies, are precisely the same.

position                 of
             the ferment itself.    During the first stage       decom
position they convert starch into sugar; during the second stage
they change sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid, bile into
cholalic acid, taurine, and other products, and tannic into gallic
acid; when they have entered         the third stage     decomposition,
                                                                  on                                 of

   But it still remains uncertain, and the point is one of con
siderable interest, whether the formation of succinic acid from
sugar is a specific effect due to erythrozym alone, or is shared
by the latter in common with other ferments, such as yeast and
emulsine.    On this point                 I
                              have no evidence to offer, but must
content myself with a few general considerations, leading to the
conclusion that it is not improbable that other ferments will be
found capable, under peculiar circumstances, of producing this
acid from sugar.
   The conversion of sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid, and
also that of sugar into butyric acid, carbonic acid and hydrogen,
are well-understood processes.     In the former case 1 equiv. of
sugar splits up into 2 equivs. of alcohol, and 4 equivs. of car
bonic acid.

   In the second case, 1 equiv. of sugar splits up into 1 equiv.
of butyric acid, 4 equivs. of carbonic acid, and 4 equivs. of hy

   But as regards succinic acid, it is difficult to indicate with
positive certainty in what manner it takes               rise from sugar; its

 vol. vii. p. 476). Mr. Wilbraham's observations are as follows:–
 “If, being in ignorance what system of assumptions ought to
 be made to render the problem determinate, we were to wish to
 give a definite answer to the problem, it might be in the follow
 ing form: ascertain the chance of the required event happening
on any one system of assumptions, and the chance of that system
representing the true connexion among the simple events, and
multiply the values of these chances together; the sum of a series
of these products comprising every possible system of assump
tions would be the true chance of the event.         But Prof. Boole's
method   evidently    does not attempt  to solve  any  question of this
nature.”     Now           I
                       make no objection against the truth of the
principle here enunciated, though        may doubt          I

                                          is     the method which     to                                 I I

    The porous, insoluble sulphur which remains after the solu
 tion of the soluble part falls easily to a fine powder, which in the
water-bath coalesces to a solid mass.
    Flowers of sulphur also contain insoluble sulphur, inasmuch as
they are obtained by sudden cooling. But the greater part of them
is always soluble; only about a third of their weight is insoluble.
      If
       the sudden cooling of sulphur be repeated, after heating it
each time to about 300° C., it has a darker colour after each
operation. After six, but often after ten, repeated fusions and
sudden coolings it becomes dark brown when cold, and erystal
lizes, like common melted sulphur, in prisms.        In this phase
C. Deville has called it red   prismatic  sulphur.     shall call it                   I
repeatedly-melted, or shorter, remelted sulphur, in order to distin
guish it from the red sulphur to be afterwards described.       The
colour of remelted  sulphur  sometimes   changes  after a few hours,
but generally after some days, to a pale red; at the same time
the crystals become opake, and in          probability assume the all
octahedral form.       the sulphur If fused often enough, however,
                                                         is

red-brown colour. When common sulphur                 heated only             is                                to

peculiar deportment of black sulphur, of which we shall after
wards speak.
   By evaporating the red solution, or distilling over a part of
the bisulphide of carbon, crystals will form in the liquid which
remains behind; they have the octahedral form of common
sulphur crystallized from bisulphide of carbon.   The first which
form are yellow. After separating these and evaporating the
liquid still more, the crystals which then form have always
a redder tint.    Ultimately a thick, tough, syrup-like, deep
red mass remains behind, from which no -more crystals can be

which had been uninterruptedly exposed to heat for eight hours
gave a yellow solution; and the insoluble part, 15:04 per cent,
was pure yellow in colour.
   To prove that for the formation of black sulphur, not repeated
heating, but sudden cooling is necessary, the following experi
ment was instituted.      A quantity of common sulphur was heated
to 300° C. in a   glass vessel with a narrow neck, which was closed
by a cork and placed in a very large sand-bath, where it was
completely surrounded by sand.            After the sulphur had com
pletely attained the above temperature it was allowed to remain
in the large quantity of sand and cool down slowly to the tem
perature of the room.       This operation was repeated ten times
with the same sulphur.         After this treatment the sulphur gave
a colourless solution with bisulphide of carbon; the insoluble
residue amounted only to 1.4 per cent. of            weight, but hadits                            all
the properties       black sulphur.

                                             parts  cooling  too quickly.
  It   follows from this, that black sulphur             formed only by   is
sudden cooling.              -

   To obtain red sulphur of a beautiful colour it must be broken
into pieces of tolerable size before it is completely hardened. If
this is not done it will be long before it becomes solid, and                                                               its
colour   is  then less beautiful and more orange.                     this method              If

red sulphur.         About a third of the same is soluble in bisulphide
of carbon.          This third has a yellow colour, but consists partly of
 yellow and partly of insoluble black sulphur.
    3. The above insoluble residue, when warmed in the water
 bath, becomes soft and greasy; and after cooling, one portion
 (the yellow) is soluble, inasmuch as this, at 100°C., is more
easily converted into the soluble modification than the black.
    By repeatedly treating the insoluble residue at 100°C., the
residual powder assumes a chocolate-brown colour.
    4. This powder, when fused at 300° C. and suddenly cooled,
gives a perfectly black, greasy, ductile mass, which requires some
time to solidify, and has then a glassy appearance.              This black
sulphur does not dissolve, or does so very slightly, in bisulphide
of carbon, alcohol, aether, benzole,                  oil

      accounts
            which         many substances possess of passing from
the condition of insulators to that of conductors, by increase of
temperature, have reference to bodies so heterogeneous that it
appears almost impossible to reduce the phaenomena to one cause.
Davy’s experimentst prove that the conducting power of metallic
conductors is decreased by heating them ; whilst, according to
Ohm’s observations f, a decrease of resistance takes place in
electrolytic conductors under similar circumstances.    Hence the
passage of a body by means of heat from the condition of a
non-conductor, i.e. of a very bad conductor, to that of a con
ductor, or better conductor, can be very well explained if the
body be a compound one, but not at                     elementary                all   if   it    be       an

Faradayº has shown that liquid sulphur and phosphorus do not
conduct; hence the statement of         Inglist that iodine conducts   J.
when fused is quite  unexpected.      In this case the substance to
be tested was contained in a glass tube sealed at both ends, into
which two platinum wires were conducted. Sollyf contradicted
this experiment: he could neither detect the slightest trage by
Wollaston’s method         which the body (in     investigated,                       to   be

par. 1340: “When a piece of that substance, which had been
fused and cooled, was introduced into the circuit of a voltaic
battery, it stopped the current.   Being heated, it acquired con
dueting powers before it was visibly red-hot in daylight, and even
sparks could be taken against it whilst still solid. The current

lead might have been admixed, and thus have been electrolysed;
by no reagent, however, could any such compound be detected;
and on allowing the current to pass through the fluoride of lead
for six hours, the deflection of the galvanometer needle remained
constant during the whole period.     The experiment was repeated

how their power of conducting commences when heated, have
long since been made known. After Cavendish * had demon

and Delavali in Portland and several other stones, Aldinii was
able to produce contractions in a prepared frog by connecting
the two metals which were placed on muscle and nerve by means
of a piece of glass fused before the blowpipe. And although
Ritter § claimed an insulating power for red-hot glass, yet Pfaff||
received continuous shocks when with both hands he completed
             a voltaic battery into which a glass tube heated to
the circuit of
redness and almost to fusion was inserted.   Later, when he cor
roborated these  statements,   Ritter"  proposed   the following
questions:—“Of what nature is the conducting power of those
 individuals of this class of bodies that ultimately conduct             Do
 they conduct in the same manner as water, or in the same
manner as metals, i. e. with or without decomposition, or more
definitely in Volta's language, as conductors of the first or of the
second class 7”       In the foregoing case this last question was
exactly the one under discussion.           For my first experiments                                         I

electricity.   Here also a polarization immediately ensued, which
was similar to the one observed by Henriciº when passing the
electricity of a machine through water.    In order to determine
whether to ascribe the counter currents which were formed to
an electrolytic action, or to a deportment similar to that shown
by imperfect conductors, a piece of water-glass, after the current
of a battery had been passed through it for some time, was
broken loose from                  its
                         supports. Before, the glass had weak                                a

206              Mr.   J.   F. Brown on a General Method of Substituting
ammonia.                    As thus prepared, it is apt to carry down an excess
of oxide of lead, which is easily removed by warm acetic acid.
It is of sparing solubility in alcohol or water, and becomes
highly electrical when rubbed. This salt, contrary to expecta
tion, evolves free iodine, like the acid itself, when burned with
chromate of lead; but the phaenomenon is probably owing to the
decomposition of the salt taking place at a temperature much
lower than that sufficient to enable the iodine to combine with
lead.                                           I
        For this reason contented myself with a determination
of    oxideits          of
                lead, which was effected    igniting the salt, after                      by

210         Mr. C. G. Williams      on the presence of Pyridine in
     The alkaloids were chiefly separated from each other by frac
tional distillation, but the more volatile of them were present in
too small a quantity to render this method applicable; I there
fore availed myself of the platinum-salts as a means of purifica
tion, and on adding a strong aqueous solution of chloride of
platinum to a solution of the first fraction in hydrochloric acid,
a precipitate was obtained, which on combustion gave exactly the
 composition of picoline.         But the fraction from which this re
 sult was obtained, distilled below and at 210° Fahr., while the
 boiling-point of picoline, according to Anderson, is 272°; I there
 fore suspected the presence of a more volatile base, but was pre
 vented by deficiency of material from pursuing the investigation
further.
     Having since that time obtained another small quantity of
 liquid from the same source and boiling at the same temperature,
 I  availed myself of the opportunity of studying the separation
 of bases by fractional crystallization of platinum-salts.
     The basic oil, amounting to about three-fourths of a drachm,
 was supersaturated with hydrochloric acid, an aqueous solution of
 chloride of platinum added, and the whole diluted until the pre
 cipitate at first formed was redissolved; the liquid was then
 allowed to crystallize spontaneously,         and at the end of three
 days yielded a considerable crop.
      On examination these were found to consist of two sorts, a and
  b; the former had assumed the shape of sword-blades of a pale
  yellow colour, and more than half an inch long; b, on the other
  hand, formed small flattened four-sided prisms, verythick in pro
  portion to their length, and of a deep ruby-red.               It was, of
  course, supposed that the salts of two bases had crystallized in the
  same liquid, but on careful ignition the following
                                                  -
                                                             numbers were
 obtained:—
              1  <U+017F>q. 4707      grs. gave 1482 platinum.
                  Ub. 6.022 grs. gave 1910 platinum.

      We therefore     see that both salts had the same composition,
  but the    anomaly    in the boiling-point, and the difference in the
  appearance of the crystals, renders the opinion probable that
  two bases are present, bearing the same relation to each other
  that picoline does to aniline.
      Recent researches having shown the constitution of platinum
   salts to be remarkably modified by the action of heat upon their
  solutions, the evaporations in these experiments were made by
   exposing them to a surface of sulphuric acid until a crop was
   obtained, which was then removed and the operation repeated.

   :  It is absolutely     necessary before igniting the salts to pulverize
 the    crystals   and wash them with a mixture of alcohol and aether;
 the appearance of the powder becomes much altered by this
 operation, as it removes a resinous impurity which causes the
 particles to hang together, while after washing with the mixture
 indicated, and subsequent drying, the powder becomes as mobile
as fine dry sandº.           Moreover, it is inadmissible to dry the cry
 stals   by   heat,  a temperature    of even 212° having the power to
cause a slow evolution of the        base, and also appearing to alter the
constitution of the salt; it was always dried, therefore, over sul
phuric acid until it ceased to lose weight.
     The second crop of crystals consisted of large thick prisms.

                  32-22                             32-94
     The fourth crop; very hard short prisms of a deep red colour.
     IV.    4.520 grs. gave 1.478 gr. platinum.
                Per. cent.                     Theory (picoline).
                  32-69                             32-94
     The fifth crop; groups of deep orange radiated needles.
     V. 5.252 grs. gave 1-823 gr. platinum.
                Per. cent.                     Theory (pyridine).
                  34.71                             34-60
     The first and second crops are seen therefore to be alike, also
the third and fourth; the first two consisting of lutidine, the
next two of picoline, and the fifth of pyridine; the reason of the
latter base appearing only in the last crop is in consequence of
the smallness of the quantity present.             It is interesting to ob
serve the steadiness of the rise of platinum in the fractions
until we read the last, when it suddenly springs from 327 to 347.
The assertion in my former memoir that the fractional crystal
lization of platinum salts affords a far readier mode of purification
of homologous volatile bases than distillation, appears, therefore,
to be borne out by this result, for it is certain that even with
many times the quantity of material, a separation like this could
not have been effected by the other method.
     It   is difficult to explain how a liquid containing a considerable
quantity of picoline which boils at 272°, a somewhat less amount
of lutidine (boiling-point 310°), and a little pyridine boiling at
240°, should distil below 210° (especially as it was ascertained
     * It is believed that Hofmann first indicated the importance   of this pro
 cedure in his researches on the volatile organic bases.

212            On the presence of Pyridine in Naphtha.
that no other bases having different per-centages of platinum in
their saltswerepresent), unless by supposing thereal boiling-points
to be much lower than those indicated by their discoverer, and,
in fact, I have since ascertained that he does not by any means
insist upon their accuracy.       If
                                   the suggestion thrown out, of the
presence of two bases of the composition of lutidine, be correct,
we can easily imagine that to be the cause of the discrepaney;
but   I  have obtained in the crystallization of the platinum-salts
of aethylamine, crops forming together, and yet having no resem
blance in colour or form, some being thin lemon-coloured plates,
and others solid deep red prisms, both, however, giving the same
                                                                   º,
results on analysis.
   It is somewhat singular that the so-called quinoline, submitted
to fractional distillation, yields a base having a constitution ap
parently closely allied to the pyridine series; in fact one of the
fractions converted into platinum salt yielded exactly the quantity
of carbon, hydrogen, and platinum in the base between lutidine
and parvoline; this result, and some others, has induced
                                                     -

undertake a rigid examination of quinoline.
   It was, unfortunately, impossible to obtain enough platinum
salt of pyridine from the shale products at my disposal for a
combustion; but when we consider that in the bases from the
same source    I have demonstrated the existence of all the other
members   of the series, and that the fifth fraction gives exactly
the theoretical quantity of platinum, we have no reason to doubt
the presence of pyridine; the more especially, that although the
powerfully-odorous picoline is present, it is unable entirely to
conceal the overpowering smell peculiar to the former base, ºr "
  The difficulties in the way of separating several basic liquids
of analogous constitution by fractional distillation is so great,
that it would appear quite hopeless to obtain any one product
absolutely pure, even where the quantity of material at command
is very considerable; but by first fractionating the liquid by di
stillation and then converting the fractions into platinum-salts
and repeatedly crystallizing until the product gives exactly the
theoretical quantity of platinum, we may, by distillation with
potash, obtain the base in a state     fit
                                      for examination        pro   of   its

 paper       is   published             by   M. Bussy, containing                           an   analysis        by   M. Des

 2I4                          Royal Society.
  champs of a fluid, which flowed from the ear of a man who had
  sustained a fracture of the base of the cranium.    From a comparison
  between the composition of this fluid and that given by M. Lassaigne
  as the composition of the cerebro-spinal fluid, M. Bussy arrived at the
  conclusion that they were identical in their origin. In addition, how
  ever, to the albumen and ordinary saline constituents, M. Deschamps
 found that the fluid obtained from the fractured cranium contained
 a certain constituent which possessed the peculiar property of re
  ducing the blue protoxide of copper to the state of the yellow sub
  oxide.
     As this power of reducing the oxide of copper is possessed also by
  grape-sugar, M. Bussy arrived at the conclusion that this fluid con
 tained a small portion of grape-sugar, and as additional evidence in
  support of this conclusion he quotes the experiments of M. Bernard,
 who, by irritating the base of the encephalon and the origin of the
 vagus nerve, produced an excess of sugar in the secretions.           He
  supposes that in the present instance the fracture through the base
  of the cranium may have produced some irritation at the origin of
 the pneumogastric, and thus have excited the formation of sugar.
 Such a supposition would have received additional confirmation if at
 the same time an analysis could have been made of the blood, urine,
 or other secretions, so as to determine if sugar was present in those
 fluids—no such analysis however is given. The property of re
 ducing the oxide of copper was also found by M. Bussy to reside in
 the cerebro-spinal fluid of the Horse and Dog.         In none of these
 experiments was he able to induce fermentation.         As this reducing
 power is not peculiar to grape-sugar, but is possessed by other orga
 nic substances, such as lactine and lactucine, this test alone should
 not be relied on as affording any positive indications of its presence;
 recourse should therefore be had to other confirmatory experiments.
    With a view to determine this point, Mr. Paget, in the early
 part of March last, gave me for examination three separate portions
 of the cerebro-spinal fluid, obtained by puncturing a spina bifida
in a child, several days intervening between the removal of each
 portion.
    Those removed on the first two occasions were perfectly clear and
pellucid, giving an alkaline reaction to test-paper, their spec. grav.
being 1:006, no spontaneous coagulation taking place after standing
for some time; that removed on the third occasion had a slightly
yellow tinge, and a distinct coagulum formed in it on standing. The
presence of fibrine in this instance was owing doubtless to some
slight inflammation having been set up, caused by the successive
puncturings.     The three specimens corresponded in the following
characters : —
    1st. No precipitate on applying heat, merely an opalescence being
produced; on the addition of a few drops of nitric acid a white flaky
precipitate subsided.    Nitric acid alone, without heat, also caused
                                                                          t
a precipitate.
    The non-precipitation of the albumen, until the addition of the
acid, was owing to the alkalinity of the fluid.

    2nd. Boiled with liquor potassae a very faint pinkish tint was pro
 duced ; a few white flakes also fell down.
    3rd. Heated in a water-bath with the blue oxide of copper, in a
few minutes the yellowish red powdery suboxide precipitated.
    This reaction took place both in the original albuminous liquid and
after the coagulation of the albumen by heat and nitric acid.
    4th. A piece of flannel, saturated with the chloride of tin, was
well moistened with the fluid, and then heated over a red-hot coal;
no brown colour of the flannel was produced, such as occurs when
grape-sugar is present.        (Maumene's test.)                     -
    5th. A   portion  mixed in a test-tube with some German yeast was
placed for several hours in a warm cupboard, but there was no deve
lopment of gas.
    From these experiments it appears that of the various tests em
ployed, only one gave any indication of the presence of grape-sugar,
that test also being the one which is most liable to deception. The
lowness of the specific gravity, in which respect this fluid and that
analysed by M. Deschamps closely corresponded, would, a priori,
almost lead to the assumption that no grape-sugar was present.
    The presence of the reducing agent could not in this case depend
upon any irritation of the origin of the vagus, for the irritation, if
any, produced by a spina bifida is at the end of the cerebro-spinal
axis furthest removed from the origin of that nerve. That the ma
terial however which effects this reduction is of a very changeable
nature, was shown by allowing a portion of the fluid to stand for
several days until putrefaction had commenced. The fluid was then
filtered so as to separate the insoluble albuminous flakes, and the
clear liquid heated in a water-bath with the blue oxide of copper;
when, instead of the suboxide being produced, the black anhydrous
 oxide was formed, just as is the case when the blue oxide is heated
 merely with water, thus satisfactorily showing that the reducing
 substance had been destroyed.
    The recent investigations of Virchow” and Buskt have shown
 that substances of a non-nitrogenous nature exist both in the brain
 and spinal cord, but they hold somewhat different opinions respect
 ing their exact characters; for whilst the former considers them to
 be cellulose, the latter regards them both in their “structural, che
 mical and optical properties” to resemble starch.               In conformity
 with these    views, it was   interesting   to determine if   any  indications
 of the presence of either of these substances could be found in the
 cerebro-spinal fluid; accordingly a portion of the fluid was evapo
 rated nearly to dryness and then divided into two portions; to one
 was added an alcoholic solution of iodine and concentrated sulphuric
 acid, when a violet tint was produced, which after a few minutes dis
 appeared ; but it was also found that this same appearance was pro
 duced when the acid and iodine solution were mixed together alone,
 the violet colour being evidently owing to the volatilization of a part
 of the iodine and the evolution of its characteristic violet tint; to
 the other a solution of iodide of potassium and then nitric acid was

 added, when a brown colour was produced, owing to the liberation
 of the iodine.   In neither portion could it be said that any evidence
 of the presence of starch or cellulose was detected.
    A comparative trial was also made between the effects produced
 upon the blue oxide of copper by the cerebro-spinal fluid, solutions
 of grape-sugar, cane-sugar, starch, cellulose, and mannite, an unfer
 mentizable sugar. These various substances were heated in a water
 bath for the same length of time, when it was found that whilst the
 grape-sugar effected a reduction immediately, and the cerebro-spinal
 fluid only after the lapse of several minutes, neither the starch, cellu
 lose, cane-sugar nor mannite effected any reduction at all. " " '                                              "
     The power of reducing the blue oxide of copper is not confined to
 non-nitrogenous substances, for I found that if a solution of leucine”
 be heated along with it in the usual manner, the reduction is effected
 in about the same length of time, and in the same way as by the
cerebro-spinal fluid. This single experiment is not of itself sufficient
evidence that the reducing power in both cases depends upon the
presence of the same substance. Such an assertion could only of
course be proved by obtaining from the cerebro-spinal fluid leucine.
in the crystallized form. A proper quantity of the fluid was not,
however, left to investigate this point.                            *- :
    From the above experiments I think it may be safely asserted that
the power possessed by the cerebro-spinal fluid of reducing the oxide
of copper, is not owing to the presence either of grape-sugar or any
of the allied substances: whether it may depend upon the presence.
of leucine or other modifications of albumen of a somewhat similar
nature, or whether it may be due to the presence of a substance be
longing to another series, is a point that has yet to be determined.[g
   Note by Mr. PAGET.—The patient from whom the fluid analysed
by Mr. Turner was obtained, was a girl born of healthy parents. An
infant cousin had lately died from the same congenital defect as she
presented. The upper part of the body was well formed, but the
pelvis and lower limbs were small and nearly powerless. The sac
containing    the fluid was seated over the last lumbar vertebra, pro
jecting (as the examination after    death showed) through an opening
between     itsunclosed arches.     enlarged quickly after birth, but did

withdrawn when the child was three months old. Neither              this,                              on
nor    on

                                         the emptied sac indicated that
the pressure upon the spinal cord was greatly diminished. After every
evacuation the sac very quickly filled again, notwithstanding pressure'
exercised upon           it.                                   *.*, +-

     The examination after death showed that the fluid was collected
in the expanded tissue of the pia mater, or subarachnoid spaces,
about the cauda equina.    The pia mater presented appearances of

of the blue colour when Price's test is used and nitrous acid is pre

it makes it disappear.

 dilute solution was made, and it was tested by Price's test (starch,

                                                      of
acid, and that then the distillate gave no reaction with Price's test.
    The following experiments were made with every precaution.
    Anhydrous phosphoric acid was prepared, and              was found                          it                    to    be
free from nitrous acid. Some healthy urine was taken and some
pure nitrate        potassa,      the proportion     in two grains                         of                   of
                                                                                                                             of to
                         of                                            salt
 an  ounce     fluid, and distilled with phosphoric acid (ten ounces
                    of
urine, twenty grains       nitre, and one ounce
                                        of             anhydrous phosphoric              of
 acid).   On concentrating, the neutralized dilute nitrous acid was
 detected          by    all
                   the tests, namely, the indigo test, the protosulphate
of iron and Price's test.
     In   second experiment, five ounces
          a                                        urine with five grains         of                                         of
 nitre and half      ounce    ananhydrous phosphoric acid, gave nitrous
                                               of
acid by all the tests. The distillation was continued until the con
tents of the retort were viscid.

    In a third experiment, three ounces of urine with a grain and a half
of nitre were distilled with three drachms of glacial phosphoric acid;
the distillate neutralized and evaporated gave no trace of nitrous
acid; the same urine with the same quantity of nitre and three
drachms of sulphuric acid, when distilled, gave a distillate, which
when neutralized and evaporated gave decided evidence of nitrous
acid.
   In my former paper I showed that by distilling with sulphuric
acid when only one-tenth of a grain of nitre was added to each
ounce of urine, nitrous acid could be detected.
   From these experiments it appears that distillation with sulphuric
acid is to be preferred to distillation with phosphoric acid; but even
with this last acid, when a grain of nitre is added to an ounce of
urine, the nitrous acid can be detected.
   I  then endeavoured, by using phosphoric instead of sulphuric acid
in distilling urine   passed after a salt of ammonia had been taken
into the stomach, to detect nitrous acid in the urine.
   Two drachms of muriate of ammonia were taken in seven ounces
of distilled water.    The urine was collected for six hours afterwards.
Twelve ounces of this urine were distilled with one ounce of phos
phoric acid (anhydrous).      The distillate, when concentrated, did not
give any evidence of nitrous acid by Price's test.
   The same experiment was repeated with no better result.
   In another experiment, sulphuric acid, six drachms to twelve
ounces of urine, was used instead of phosphoric acid.       The distillate
as soon as it was obtained gave the slightest precipitate with chloride
of barium insoluble in nitric acid, showing that a trace of sulphuric
acid was carried over into the receiver.        The distillate was made
alkaline with pure carbonate of soda, evaporated, and nitrous acid
was immediately detected by the indigo and iron test, as well as by
Price's test. A portion of the distillate left exposed to the air, on
the following day had lost the power of liberating iodine.           This
arose from the nitrous acid passing into nitric acid.
   Pure nitre gives no colour with starch, iodide of potassium and
dilute hydrochloric acid, bºt when fused it produces the liberation
of iodine immediately.      If the solution of fused nitre is exposed to
the air it loses this   property,  but regains it when the solution is
evaporated to dryness and refused and again dissolved.
   In another experiment six ounces of urine passed before the mu
riate of ammonia was taken were distilled with half an ounce of sul
phuric acid, the distillate was highly acid, and gave a slight preci
pitate with chloride of barium; it was made slightly alkaline, eva
porated to a small residue, and then gave no evidence of nitrous
acid.    Then two drachms of muriate of ammonia were taken in seven
ounces of distilled water, eight ounces of urine passed four hours
afterwards were distilled with half an ounce of sulphuric acid. The
distillate was fractional; the first portion gave no colour with starch
test; it contained a minute trace of sulphurous acid. The second
portion was highly acid; it was made slightly alkaline, evaporated
nearly to dryness, and then gave most positive evidence of nitrous

   Thus before the salt of ammonia was taken no nitrous acid could
be detected in the urine, whilst after the ammonia nitrous acid was
proved to be present, not only by Price's test, but by the indigo test
also.                                                                                  ,   -    , ºf
   In conclusion, it results from these experiments, 1st, That in
Price's test sulphurous acid produces exactly the opposite effect to
mitrous acid, and even hinders nitrous acid from liberating iodine
from hydriodic acid.                                                  2
   2ndly. That phosphoric acid, when mixed with urine containing
nitre and distilled very low, does liberate nitrous acid; though when
used instead of sulphuric acid, it does not enable the nitrous acid to
be detected so readily as when the latter acid is employed.          Af
   Hence the    experiments  performed   in Professor Lehmann's labo
ratory by Herr Jaffé”, do not invalidate Price's test for nitrous acid
in the way Professor Lehmann supposes; and by again repeating
some of my former experiments, I still arrive at the conclusion that
when ammonia is taken into the body nitric acid may be detected
in the urine, but that the quantity which can be made to appear is
so small that the most delicate method is required for its detection,
This however is no proof that a much larger quantity may not be
lost in the process for obtaining it from the urine.                 fe

second objection rests upon the mechanical difficulty of bringing the
calculus within the direct route of the electrical discharge, but would
scarcely apply were it demonstrated that the disruptive effects of
electricity can be obtained without any such direct transmission of
the current.                                                              w
    My own attention was some years since directed to the subject
by reading an account of the following experiment first performed
by Mr. Crosse.       “Two platinum wires one-thirtieth of an inch in
diameter were secured to a slip of window glass half an inch wide
and four inches long, so that they rested upon the flat surface of the
glass, leaving an interval between their points of one-twentieth of
an inch.     The wires were connected, one with the negative con
ductor of a powerful machine, the other with a ball to receive sparks
from the prime conductor.        On placing the glass in a flat dish filled
with water and      turning  the machine, the glass between the points
soon became       fractured,   and after 100 revolutions the fracture
enlarged and two small cracks appeared.        After 200 revolutions an
excavation was formed, but on the side opposite to that on which
the wires were tied.      After 250 revolutions the glass was completely
perforated.     Many variations of this experiment were made, in all
of which the same kind of mechanical effect was obtained.            Even
quartz was excavated”.”
    It being thus shown that a lateral disruptive action takes place
within a certain distance of the seat of discharge, the idea at once
suggested itself to me, that by using two parallel wires separated at
their extremities like those in Mr. Crosse's experiment, and similarly
connected with an electrical machine or Leyden jar, bringing their
ends in contact with the surface of a calculus, and then allowing a
series of moderate discharges to take place between the extremities
of the wires, a disintegrating effect would be produced upon urinary
calculi of the same nature as that witnessed in glass and quartz.
And short of the actual disintegration of a calculus in the bladder
of a living person, the following experiments will, I trust, be deemed
 conclusive on this point.
 2. Two copper wires, one-twentieth       of an inch in diameter, were
 connected, one with the external, the other with the internal surface
 of a Leyden jar, having about 400 square inches of internal metallic
 coating.    These copper wires were soldered to platinum wires half
 an inch long and one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter.         Each wire
 was drawn through a fine gutta percha tube, and the tubes, having
 first been placed perfectly parallel, were warmed and gently pressed
 together so as to assume somewhat of the appearance of a flexible
 bougie ; the platinum wires projecting beyond the gutta percha to
 the extent of one-eighth of an inch, and their free extremities being
 slightly everted and separated from each other by an interval of one
 tenth of an inch.     In experimenting, the united gutta percha tubes
 were   grasped  and the projecting platinum points pressed against the
 surface of the calculus: the jar was then discharged by another

  person, and a series of such discharges thus passed between the free
  extremities of the parallel platinum wires while resting upon the
   surface of the stone. .                                    -
      With this simple arrangement, fragments a quarter of an inch
   long were broken off flints immersed in water, and the same force
  was applied to urinary calculi with the following results:--
      Exp. 1. June 7th.-A piece of a large lithic acid calculus was
  placed in a bladder, nearly filled with water, into which the gutta
  percha bougie containing the wires was then introduced and the
  neck of the bladder tied round the instrument.            The bladder with
  its contents being placed on a wet board, the projecting platinum
  wires were then kept in contact with the surface of the calculus
  and the jar discharged. On opening the bladder and examining the
  stone, it was found to be broken into numerous fragments by the
  single discharge.
      Exp. 2.-A small phosphatic calculus, very smooth and hard, was
  experimented upon in a similar manner. The first five discharges
  produced no perceptible effect, but the sixth split it into at least
  twenty fragments, and many of these, on being slightly pressed
  between the finger and thumb, readily broke down.
      Exp. 3.-A very large oxalate of lime or mulberry calculus with
  projecting tubercles was similarly tested, and the first discharge pro
  duced a small cavity in the surface to which the wires were applied,
  separating a considerable quantity of fine sand; but subsequent dis
  charges did not act so efficiently on this very large stone.
      Exp. 4.—On the following day, June 8th, the experiment was
  repeated in the presence of Messrs. Potter, Rayne and Furness, sur
  geons in Newcastle, and a small calculus, removed a few months
  since by the gentleman last mentioned from a young boy, was, after
  a few trials, split through the centre, one-half being reduced to frag
  ments, and the other exhibiting in                    its

  nucleus of lithic acid.
      These experiments appear          demonstrate the practicability
                                              to                                              of

  On the whole, I am                    of opinion that the electrical force applied in
the manner indicated,    will be found quite as efficient for the disin
tegration of calculi in the bladder as the more formidable analogous
operation of lithotrity, occasionally practised. And, as regards sim
plicity and security, the electrical apparatus certainly appears pre
ferable to the instruments used for crushing the stone by ordinary
mechanical force.

                                   in
stating that         Orbicula the pallial veins terminate
                         in                                              the hearts,            in

 from which arterial branches proceed to the liver and ovary.       Pro
 fessor Owen further adds for the Brachiopoda in general,—
    “Each heart, for example, in the Brachiopoda is as simple as in
Ascidia, consisting of a single elongated cavity, and not composed of
a distinct auricle and ventricle as in the ordinary Bivalves,” and he
compares the hearts of Brachiopoda to the auricles of Arca, &c.
(Trans. Zoological Society, vol. i. p. 159).
    In 1843, however, M. Vogt's elaborate memoir on Lingula ap
peared, in which the true complex structure of the “heart” in this
genus was first explained and the plaited ‘auricle’ discriminated
from the ‘ventricle;’ and in 1845, Professor Owen, having apparently
been thus led to re-examine the circulatory organs of Brachiopoda,
published his ‘Lettre sur l'appareil de la Circulation chez les Mol
lusques de la Classe des Brachiopodes,’ in which he felicitates
M. Milne-Edwards on the important confirmation of the views which
the latter entertains with respect to the lacunar nature of the circu
lation in the Mollusca, afforded by the Brachiopoda, and describes
each heart of the Terebratulidae as consisting of a ventricle and a
plaited auricle, the pallial veins not terminating in the latter but in
the general visceral cavity.    As the Professor does not recal the view
which he had already taken of the circulation in Orbicula, I presume
that he considers two opposite types of the circulatory organs to ob
tain in the Brachiopoda, the direction of the current being from the
mantle through the heart towards the body in Orbicula, and from
the mantle through the body towards the heart in Terebratula.
    The possibilities of nature are so various that I would not venture,
without having carefully dissected Orbicula,-no opportunity of doing
which has yet presented itself-to call this view in question, but I
think it seems somewhat improbable.          Indeed the structural rela
tions which I have observed and which are described below, do not
appear to me to square with any of the received doctrines of Bra
chiopod circulation, but I offer them simply as facts, not being
prepared at present to present any safe theory on the subject.
    In Waldheimia flavescens there are two “hearts,’ situated as Pro
fessor Owen describes them, but so far as I have been able to ob
serve, the ventricle cannot be described as an ‘oval’ cavity, inas
much as it is an elongated cavity bent sharply upon itself.       Hastily
 examined of course this     may  appear   oval.   I have been  similarly
unable to discover ‘the delicate membrane of the venous sinuses,”
 which is said by Professor Owen to “communicate with and close
 the basal apertures of the auricles,” or to perceive that the auricular
 cavity can be “correctly described as a closed one, consisting at the
 half next the ventricle, of a beautifully plicated muscular coat in
 addition to the membranous one, but at the other half next the
 venous sinus of venous membrane only; the latter might be termed
 the auricular sinus, the former the auricle proper.”
     I presume that “this delicate membrane of the venous sinuses'
 is what I have called the ilio-parietal band, in which the base of the
 auricle is as it were set, like a landing-net in     its hoop, but this
 does not close the base of  the auricle, the latter opening widely into
  the visceral chamber.

230                                 Royal Society.
   I have equally failed in detecting any arteries continued from the
apices of the ventricles; and I have the less hesitation in supposing
I have not overlooked them, as Mr. Albany Hancock, whose works
are sufficient evidence of the value of his testimony, permits me
to say that he long since arrived at the conclusion that no such arte
ries exist.
   What has given rise to the notion of the existence of these arteries
appears to me to be this.    A narrow band resembling those I have
already described, is attached in Waldheimia along the base of the
‘ ventricle' and the contiguous outer parietes of the auricle: inferiorly
it passes outwards to the sinuses, and running along their inner
wall, forms a sort of ridge or axis” from which the genitalia, whether
ovaria or testes, are developed, stretching through their whole length
and following the ramifications of the sinuses.    It is the base of these
ridges seen through the walls of the sinuses, where they extend
beyond the genitalia, which have been described as arteries.
   The upper end of the band passes into the sinuses of the upper lobe
of the mantle, and comes into the same relation with the genitalia
which they enclose.
   The walls of the auricle in Waldheimia are curiously plaited, but
I have been unable, in either auricle or ventricle, to detect any such
arrangement of muscular fibres as that which has been described.
The epithelial investment of the auricle, on the other hand, is well
developed, and in the ventricle the corresponding inner coat is raised
up into rounded villous eminences.
   The ventricle lies in the thickness of the parietes, while the auricle
floats in the visceral cavity, supported only by the ilio-parietal band.
The former is at first directed downwards, but then bends sharply
round and passes upwards to terminate by a truncated extremity
close to the suboesophageal ganglion and bases of the arms.
   Mr. Hancock informs me, that in his dissections he repeatedly
found an aperture by which the apex of the ‘ventricle' communi
cated with the pallial cavity; and that, taking this fact in combina
tion with the absence of any arteries leading from this part, he had
been tempted to doubt the cardiac nature of these organs altogether,
and to regard them rather as connected with the efferent genital
system, had not the difficulty of determining whether these aper
tures were artificial or natural prevented his coming to any definite
conclusion at all.                                                                        :
   Before becoming acquainted with Mr. Hancock's investigations, I
had repeatedly observed these apertures in Rhynchonella, but preoc
cupied with the received views on the subject, I at once interpreted
them as artificial.  A knowledge of Mr. Hancock's views, however,
led me to reconsider the question, and I have now so repeatedly
observed these apertures both in Waldheimia and in Rhynchonella,
that I am strongly inclined to think they may after           natural. all   be
     these organs     hearts,

which Professor Owen describes, while he has apparently overlooked
the other two, at least he says (speaking as I presume of Rhyncho
nella) (l.c. p. 148) that the venous sinuses “enter the two hearts
or dilated sinuses which are situated exterior to the liver, and in
T. Chilensis and T. Sowerbii just within the origins of the internal

    In Waldheimia the membranous walls of the body, the parieto-in
 testinal bands and the mantle, present a very peculiar structure;
they consist of an outer and an inner epithelial layer, of two corre
 sponding fibrous layers, and between them of a reticulated tissue,
 which makes up the principal thickness of the layer, and in which
the nerves and great sinuses are imbedded.                            -
    The trabeculae of this reticulated tissue contain granules and cell
 like bodies, and I imagined them at first to represent a fibro-cellular
 network, the interspaces of which I conceived were very probably
 sinuses. Sheaths of this tissue were particularly conspicuous along
                                                  I
 the nerves. On examining the arms, however, found that the oblique
 markings, which have given rise to the supposition that they are
 surrounded by muscular bands, proceeded from trabeculae of a simi
 lar structure, which took a curved course from a canal which lies at
 the base of the cirri (not the great canal of the arms, of course)
 round the outer convexity of the arm, and terminated by breaking
up into a network.      These trabeculae, however, were not solid but
 hollow, and the interspaces between them were solid. The network
 into which they broke up was formed by distinct canals, and then,
after uniting with two or three straight narrow canals which ran
 along the outer convexity of the arm close to its junction with the
 interbrachial fold, appeared to become connected with a similar
 system of reticulated canals which occupied the thickness of that
fold.
    It was the examination of the interbrachial fold, in fact, which
first convinced me that these reticulated trabeculae were canals; for
it is perfectly clear that  vessels or channels of some kind must sup
ply the proportionally enormous mass of the united arms with their
nutritive material, and it is so easy to make thin sections of this part,
that I can say quite definitely that no other system of canals than
these exists in this locality.
    The facts, then, with regard to the real or supposed circulatory
organs of the Terebratulidae, are simply these:—
    1. There are two or four organs (hearts), composed each of a free
funnel-shaped portion with plaited walls, opening widely into the
visceral cavity at one end, and at the other connected by a constricted
neck, with narrower, oval or bent, flattened cavities, engaged in the
substance of the parietes. The existence of muscular fibres in either
of these is very doubtful.     It is certain that no arteries are derived
from the apex of the so-called ventricle, but whether this naturally
opens externally or not is a point yet to be decided.
    2. There is a system of ramified peripheral vessels.
    3. There are one or more pyriform vesicles.
    4. There are the large 'sinuses’ of the mantle, and the ‘visceral
cavity’ into which they open.
    To determine in what way these parts are connected and what
functions should be ascribed to each, it appears to me that much
further research is required.

 indigo is met with in urine in considerable amount, it forms a vehicle
 for the elimination of any excess of carbon contained in the system.
 This view is borne out by the important fact, that the greater
 number of cases in which indigo has been observed to be developed
 in the urine in large amount have been cases of extensive tubercular
 disease of the lungs, and in which the decarbonizing functions of
 those organs are greatly impaired.

    May    1, 1854.—A paper was read by Professor De Morgan on the
 Convergency of Maclaurin's Series, being an Appendix to a paper on
 some Points in the theory of differential equations.     See the abstract
of the former paper, Phil. Mag. vol. vii. p. 450.
    Mr. Kingsley made an oral communication on the Chemical
 Nature of Photographic Processes.
    May 15.-A paper was read by Mr. Warburton on Self-repeating
 Series.
    In computing Bernoulli numbers by the formula of Laplace*, the
 author of this paper was led to notice, that in the fraction whose
 development is a series of the form 1***—2**'t-H         3”.     tº —&c.,
 the numerator of that fraction is a recurrent function of t. This led
 him to investigate the question, what are the conditions which the
 denominator of the generating fraction, and the terms of the series
 generated, must satisfy, in order that the numerator of such a frac
 tion may be a recurrent function of t. The paper contains the result
of that investigation.
    The author calls those series “self-repeating,” which, when ex
tended without limit in opposite directions, admit of separation into
 two similar arms, each arm beginning with a finite term of the same
magnitude.       Between this pair of finite terms, either no zero-term,
or one or more zero-terms, may intervene. One arm repeats, and
contains arranged in reverse order, the terms of the other arm, either
all, or none, of the terms having their signs changed. The different
positive integer powers of the natural numbers, of the odd numbers,
and of the figurate numbers of the several orders, present familiar
examples of self-repeating recurring series.
    The author demonstrates the following three theorems respecting
self-repeating recurring series:—
    I. If the series arising from the development of a proper fraction
is the right arm of a self-repeating recurring series, and if the deno
minator of such a fraction is a recurrent function of t, then the nu
merator also is a recurrent function of t.
    II. Other things remaining the same, if the numerator of the
fraction is a recurrent function of t, then the denominator also is a
recurrent function of t.
              * See Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, 1777.

                     Cambridge  Philosophical Society.                235
   III. If the   numerator and the denominator of a proper fraction are
 each a recurrent function   of t, then the series, arising from the deve
lopment of the fraction according to the positive integer powers of t,
will be the right arm of a self-repeating recurring series.
   By way of example, the author applies his first theorem to the
summation of the infinite series 1"–2'--39–&c., and compares his
process with the corresponding processes of Laplace and of Sir John
Herschel.      The sum in question is given by Sir John Herschel (see
Jameson's Journal, January 1820) in terms of the differences of the
powers of 0, extending from A'09 to A909.        In the author's process,
the  requisite  differences extend from A'09   only  to A*09, and the nu
merical coefficients of these are of diminished magnitude, and of
very easy determination.
   The author makes other applications of his theorems; but on
these we forbear to enter.
   A paper was read by Professor Challis on the Determination of the
Longitude of the Cambridge Observatory by Galvanic Signals.
   The experiment of which this paper contains the details, was
made at the suggestion of the Astronomer Royal, and conducted
according to a scheme arranged by him for giving and receiving
the signals.     A galvanic connexion having been established between
the Greenwich Observatory and the Cambridge Telegraph Office,
by means of the London central station of the Electric Telegraph
Company, signals were sent on the nights of May 17 and 18,
1853, between 11" and 12" mean time.            The signals were made
by   causing two needles, one at Greenwich, the other at Cam
bridge, to start by completing the galvanic circuit at either place of
observation.      The times of starting were noted at both places, and
reduced to the sidereal times of the respective observatories, to serve
by comparison for determinations of the difference of their longi
tudes.    On each night the signals were made alternately for a quarter
of an hour at one station, in batches containing an arbitrary number
of signals not exceeding nine, and then for a quarter of an hour at
the other station in a similar manner.       On the first night the total
number of     signals  was 151, and on the second night 139.      The two
observers, Mr. Dunkin of the Greenwich Observatory, and Mr. Todd
of the Cambridge Observatory, changed places in the interval between
the two nights’ observations; Mr. Todd observing at Greenwich, and
Mr. Dunkin at Cambridge, on the second night. Also it was arranged
that the two observers should observe identical stars on the two
nights, as well as the stars ordinarily used for clock errors, and that
the same apparent right ascensions of the stars should be employed
for reducing the signal-times at both observatories. The Cambridge
 Observatory time was conveyed with the greatest care to the Tele
 graph Office at the Cambridge Railway Station by the transfer of
 three chronometers.       By a first calculation, the longitude of the
 Cambridge Observatory was found to be 23*03 east of Greenwich.
    Professor Challis subsequently made another calculation, taking
 into account the effect on the times of meridian transits of stars
 produced by the forms of the transit-pivots, according to a method

which he has described in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical
Society (vol. xix. p. 103). The errors arising from the deviation of
the pivots from the cylindrical form being eliminated, the longitude
is found to be 22*70 east of Greenwich, which is less by 0°84 than
the value hitherto adopted.

might be hoped that at a still higher temperature it would lose water.
I first ascertained that taurine might be heated to 464°F. without
decomposition or fusion. Isaethionate of ammonia heated to 392°F.
began to lose weight; I heated it to 446°F., and kept it at this tem
perature until it had lost 11 per cent. of its weight.   The mass was
dissolved in water; on the addition of alcohol it is precipitated in
crystals; this precipitate, dissolved in water, furnished by sponta
neous evaporation large crystals exactly identical with the crystals
of taurine prepared from bile.      Like taurine, they bear exposure
to a temperature of 464° F. without fusing or acquiring colour;
they evolve no ammonia with a solution of potash; they do not pre
cipitate the salts of baryta when boiled with nitric acid or nitro
muriatic acid. When fused with potash and nitrate of potash, they

  ON SOME COMBINATIONS    OF HYDRARGY ROMETHYLE AND                                  HY
               DRARGY RAETHYLE.  BY A. STRECKER.
   Frankland found a short time since, that when iodide of methyle
and iodide of amyle in contact with mercury are exposed to the
influence of the solar rays, crystals are formed of which the composi
tion is expressed by the formulae C* Hº Hg"I and C19H1' Hg”I, and
to which he gave the names of iodide of hydrargyromethyle and
iodide of hydrargyramyle.      He did not succeed in producing an ana
logous compound with iodide of aethyle, although the existence of
this combination might be presumed.
   Before I was acquainted with Frankland's experiments, I had
already obtained the iodide of hydrargyraethyle, which may easily
be produced from a mixture of iodide of aethyle and mercury under
the influence of diffused light. After some time crystals are formed,
of which the quantity increases until the whole of the liquid sets
into a mass. The crystals dissolve in boiling aether and alcohol,
from which they separate in thin, colourless, shining laminae. They
sublime at 212°F., but only fuse at a higher temperature. They do
not dissolve in water, but are soluble in ammonia and in solution of
potash, from which they crystallize again without decomposition.
On analysis I found their composition to be C4 Hº Hg?I. With nitrate
of silver they furnish iodide of silver and nitrate of hydrargyraethyle,
C*H* Hg-O. NO", which crystallizes on evaporation in colourless
prisms. Chloride of sodium precipitates chloride of hydrargyraethyle,
C*H* Hgº Cl, from the watery solution of the nitrate; it cannot be
distinguished from the iodide by           its
                                        characters.    These aethyle com
pounds are decomposed          by

                        BY A. STRECKER.
 I   pointed out some years since, that styrone, which         obtained by
                                                                         is

                                          as   it
regard  to this acid asalcohol      acetic acid. By experiments made
                                     to
at  my suggestion, M. Wolff has proved that styrone, under the influ
ence  of energetic oxidizing agents, becomes converted into cinnamic
acid.
 I   have found that styrone,      the same conditions
                                     in
                                                                 of in

or cinnamom oil.

liquid styrone, and leave the mixture exposed to the air.    In a few
days the greater part of the styrone is converted into cinnamic alde
hyde, which is separated from the unaltered styrome by the excellent
process of M. Bertagnini.    With a concentrated solution of bisul
phite of potash, crystals are obtained, which are washed with aether
to free them from the styrone.       The crystals are purified by the
addition of sulphuric  acid diluted with pure cinnamic aldehyde. The
crystals dissolve in nitric acid, and in a few moments crystals are
formed of the nitrate of the hydruret of cinnamyle.
   The conversion of styrone into hydruret of cinnamyle by the
oxygen of the air is explained by the equation—
                           C18H10O2+2O=C18H8O2+2HO.

        Description of the Apparatus and manner                     of operation.
    a homogeneous body submitted to compression in one
IN direction only, the molecules are caused to approach each
other   in this direction, and they   are forced asunder in the two
perpendicular directions: the reverse takes place when we sub
stitute traction for compression.       The relations between simul
taneous dilatations and compressions, have been actually ascer
tained to a degree of exactitude equal to that of which experi
mental questions are usually susceptible.       This mechanical effect
is accompanied by an optical one, which we can observe in trans
parent bodies, and which is explained by the diminution of the
elasticity of the aether in the direction of the mechanical com
pression, and          its
                     augmentation                 in

                                       have had recourse to the
homogeneous light emitted by salt and alcohol, which light,
according to Mr. Miller, contains almost solely orange rays in
the vicinity of the line D of Fraunhofer, and the wave-length of
which is consequently 589 millionths of a millimetre. We shall
hence have extinction of the extraordinary image whenever the
difference      of the paths is an even multiple of                           º      or of 294.5;
and extinction of the ordinary image whenever the difference of
path amounts to an odd multiple of the same quantity; we shall
also know the amount of the charges which produce this differ
ence of path.  It must, however, be remarked, that besides the
orange        the flame of alcohol and salt contains a certain
             rays,
quantity of violet light; hence in these experiments the black
colour, which would be the result of a complete extinction, is
replaced by a violet coloration, which is very distinct in one of
the two images, when                 all
                          the orange rays have disappeared; this,
however, does not interfere      the slightest degree with the ex

   All these substances are colourless, with the exception of the
heavy flints and some of the fluorides of lime, and among these
latter there are some possessing a tint so clear that the light,
after having traversed a considerable distance of them, might
still be regarded as sensibly white; we have sought to neutralize
the tinting of the others by glasses coloured with the comple
mentary tint. Another process consists in employing in the
first instance the substance itself as a coloured glass, and deter
mining by the compression of a colourless glass the lengths of
the undulations of the light which it transmits. We shall see
immediately, that when once this length is known, it is easy to
calculate the weight which it would have been necessary to em

direction of refoulement, that is to say, in the direction in which
the molecules had been previously approximated.
   It might be supposed that this difference ought not to be ob
served except at the commencement of the experiment, and that a
slight traction applied in the direction of refoulement, or a slight
pressure in the directions perpendicular to the latter, would be
sufficient to restore the equilibrium, and to bring the glass to the
state of homogeneity which constitutes the true zero of the expe
riment.      But, far from this, the difference exists under the
greatest pressures, which proves that there is an alteration in
the homogeneity of the matter, which does not manifest itself by
any optic phaenomenon, as long as the body is not subjected
anew to the action of mechanical forces.

it is in opposition to the opinion generally admitted, according

     I haveattributed to the latter the cause of the observed dif
ferences; these are my reasons: Mechanical force acts directly
only upon ponderable matter; the differences in the tension of
the aether are only a secondary consequence of the differences of
the molecular or mechanical tensions. The double refraction is
necessarily a function of the temporary linear changes, and, for
the same substance, the optic axes depend for magnitude and
position on the principal mechanical axes. It is therefore neces
sary that the form of this function should change according to
the intensity of the mechanical forces applied externally, and
that it should change not only with the amount of the charges,
but also with their mode of action; since the double refractions
differ among themselves according as the substance is compressed
or elongated by the same weight, provided the latter does not
exceed a certain limit.         In the first case, we produce artifi
cially a body possessing negative double refraction, in which the
extraordinary ray is propagated with greater velocity than the
ordinary; in the second case we obtain a positive body, in which
it is the ordinary ray which moves quickest.             now, with double       If,

   The actual observations are still too limited          enable us                      to                     to

believe that have elsewhere demonstrated that the coefficient

   mechanical elasticity increases and diminishes with the density
of of
   the substance.     Now, according          the law      changes  to                   of                     of
volume, the compression augments the density, while the trac
tion diminishes it; the curve thus appears          prolong itself                 to
                       to  points       rupture,      tearing and

260      On the double Refraction produced in Isotropic Bodies.
experiments   prove that we might safely continue to make use of
the same coefficient of elasticity in calculating the effects of trac
tions and of compressions.
    But the results acquire a great importance when they are
regarded from the point of view of the theory of molecular forces,
or those of mechanical oscillations, or of sonorous vibrations; I
believe that they will furnish the solution of a certain number of
questions which have hitherto rested in suspense, and to which I
propose to return on another occasion.
    5. The difference d of the path passed over is independent of the
length   of the undulation X; hence the dispersion of the double
refraction is insensible.
    The charges P are proportional to the differences of path
between the limits which we have defined; hence, if our propo
sition be true, we ought to have the equation
                             d   P X.
                             I = P = Nº
in which A and X’ are the lengths of the undulations of two
simple rays, and P, P' the charges which must be applied to the
same parallelopiped to obtain extinctions of the same order in
                                                     -
the one or the other image.                                     -
    This equation  is  already in part demonstrated    by the deter
mination of the fixed points which we have made        use of in the
construction of our table; to verify it between the    widest limits,
I  thought it necessary to make some observations       with the red
and violet rays.
    I have employed successively    red glasses of two descriptions;
experiment itself showed me that neither of the two was rigour
ously monochromatic; but in placing them one above the
other, I have obtained a deep red colour without any trace
of other rays. The violet light was obtained by the passage
of white light through a solution of the ammoniacal sulphate
of copper; the light transmitted still contained some yellow
rays.
    We shall now make use of our experiments to determine the
colours of the spectrum, assuming for point of comparison the
mean yellow ray    Ay-550.

mentioned, from the formulae (95), (97), (100), in a manner

  which may also be easily derived, in the same way, from (121).
  It will, however, be found, by pursuing a little further the ana
  lysis of [14], that the equations of this last type, (126) or (127),
  are always consequences of the equations of the intermediate
  type, (124) or (125); the sum of the n–2 equations of the
 form (125), which answer to the various values of e that remain
  when   f  and g have been selected, being in fact equivalent to the
 formula (126). It will also be found, by the same kind of ana
 lysis, that the intermediate equations of the type (124) or (125)
 are generally deducible from those of the form (123).                   But on
 the   subject  of these  general   reductions,  connected with the elimi
 nation of the symbols (fg) or (gf), it may be proper to add a
 few words.
     [19.] Let us admit, at least as temporary abridgments, the
 notations                              -
               [f]=X(fgh. hff); [fge] = X(fhe. geh); . (128)
 where    e,f, g  are any three unequal indices, and h varies under X,
 as before, from 1 to n. Then the formula (95) gives n—1 distinct
 equivalents for the symbol (fy), of which one is by (120) of the
 form [fg], and the       n-2   others are each of the form [fge]; in
 such a manner that we may write, instead of (95), with these
last notations, the system of the two formulae,
                       (fg)= [fg],      (fg)=[fge];         .   .    .    (129)
whereof the latter is equivalent to a system of n–2 equations:
and of course, instead of (97), we may in like manner write

The equations (99) may now be thus presented:

where e under the sign X" is distinct from each of the two indices
f  and g; but, under the double sign XX, both e and h may each
receive any one      of the values from     1 to n.  The two double sums
are equal, as in     [14], and    therefore we must have, identically,
                    [fg]+2'<U+017F> fge] = [gf]+X'[gfe);               .   .     (132)

Thus, after assigning any two unequal values to the indices                                                       f

270       M.      W.   Regnault on the Elastic Forces                of   Vapours
ciple, to experimental verification, we must know,         the total       LI.
amount of heat contained in different elastic fluids at a certain
state of temperature and pressure; II. the relations which exist
between the temperature and pressure for the same volume of
these different fluids.   The knowledge of these elements is par
ticularly important in the case of readily condensable vapours,
which are still the only elastic fluids employed in engines.
   In my preceding memoirs, which compose the twenty-first
volume of the Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences,             have                     I
published the results of my experiments on the elastic force of
aqueous vapour at saturation at different temperatures, and on the
total quantities of heat which this vapour at saturation possesses
under different pressures *. In memoirs since presented to the
Academy, which will shortly be published in eatenso in its
              I
Mémoires, have given the capacity for heat under a constant
pressure of a great number of permanent gases and super-heated
vapours, as well as the calorific changes undergone by perma
nent elastic fluids during their expansion effected under certain                                  º
conditions.
   I now propose to bring before the Academy some experiments
which I have made on the elastic force, at different temperatures,
of saturated vapours other than that of water.           shall add             I
the results of numerous      experiments  which I have made in
studying the phaenomenon of vaporization in vacuo and in gases;
a phaenomenon on which science as yet possesses but very vague
motions, deduced from a small number of experiments which are
in themselves very inconclusive.
   Although the greater part of these experiments were executed
between 1843 and 1850,                I
                              had proposed to defer their publica
tion still longer, in the hope  that            I
                                        might be able to complete
them. But many physicists being now occupied upon the same
         I
subject, am compelled to give at         events     all
                                                  brief statement  a
of the results     at
                   which    have now arrived.

 artificial atmospheres, the thermometers being immersed in the
 vapour, necessarily gives accurate results for homogeneous liquids
 when the actual pressure is exactly determined; for it is by this
 method that the boiling-point of thermometers is fixed.        But
 when solutions of fixed substances in volatile fluids, or mixtures
of several unequally volatile matters are in question, the tension
of the vapour may be very different according as it is determined

in the static condition, if may use the expression,--the vapour
and the volatile liquid being both immersed in a medium of
invariable temperature,     or in a dynamic state, under the influ
ence of a current of heat which traverses the apparatus, the
liquid receiving the heat which produces the vaporization, whilst
the vapour is subjected to refrigerating agencies which produce
its partial condensation.    The limits which           I
                                                   am compelled to
observe in this note   prevent me from  giving  further development
to these considerations.
            PART   II.-On     the Boiling-points   of Saline   solutions.
   Everyone knows that saline solutions require a higher tempera
ture to boil them than pure water under the same pressure.    For a
given salt the excess of temperature increases in proportion to
the quantity of matter dissolved.    All soluble substances do not
possess in the same degree the faculty of retarding the boiling
point of the water in which equal weights of them are dissolved.
This faculty does not depend only upon their solubility; it appears
to result principally from a special affinity of the substance for
Water.
   Rudberg has made the very curious observation, that when
concentrated saline solutions are kept boiling at temperatures
much above 100° C. under the ordinary pressure of the atmo
sphere, the vapours which they emit nevertheless only possess
the temperature which they would present if they were disen
gaged from pure water in ebullition under the same pressure.
Rudberg has made a great number of experiments on the most
various solutions, and with very exact instruments. The con
clusion which he has drawn from them is as follows:—Whatever
temperature a solution must attain before boiling, the vapour never
presents a higher temperature than that which it would have had              if
it had been disengaged from pure water; in other words, it presents
the temperature at which the tension of this vapour, at saturation
in vacuo, is in equilibrium with the pressure under which the ebul
lition takes place.    This conclusion must of course refer, not only
to the saline solutions experimented upon by Rudberg, but also
to    all
       solutions        volatile liquid

                                          substances which are fixed
 at the temperature          of   its
                              ebullition.

        is                account for this circumstance, that saline

the dissolved substance,      attraction which   angenerally  greater               is
than that arising from similar particles.               consequently                It      is
necessary for the development                              of

rises to a great height above the heated bottom, although in this
latter case the bubbles often acquire a very considerable volume

   The inspection of these tables shows that the thermometer
immersed in the vapour constantly indicates a temperature a little
higher than that of the vapour of pure water under the same
pressure; but the difference is small, and may perhaps be attri
buted to the radiation of the hot liquid and the drops of fluid
which are thrown up in abundance by saline solutions during
ebullition.     As to the thermometers which descend into the
boiling liquid, their course is extremely irregular, presenting
rapid variations which often rise to several degrees.                     It is im
possible to deduce anything certain from the indications which
they furnish.
   It may consequently be admitted that the phaenomenon ob
served by Rudberg with regard to saline solutions in ebullition
under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere, is also presented
when they are boiled under pressures greater or less than this.
   To observe more readily the circumstances under which the
phaenomenon occurs, I made some experiments in a glass balloon
with a wide mouth, upon mixtures of water and sulphuric acid in

                                      in vacuo and in Gases.                                                   277
variable proportions, taking care never to add sufficient sulphuric
acid to allow any portion of that substance to pass by distillation.

of the boiling liquid, and especially upon the briskness of the
ebullition.
   The observations which I have just described confirm the fact
announced by Rudberg, but it appears to me that they also show
its  cause; for whenever the thermometer only indicates the
temperature under which pure watery vapour                equilibrium                    is    in
with the external pressure, we find that the reservoir             wet.                                    is
On the other hand, the instrument shows higher temperature                       a
when    itsreservoir      dry,   condition which
                                   is                have only been

I     think, therefore, that the vapour, originating           boiling                                in

be as important as those which M. Biot has deduced from the
study of rotatory polarization. This method, besides, will pos
sess the advantage of a more extended application.
   In regard to these subjects, I have only been able to make a
series of observations    upon the sulphates mentioned above.
Notwithstanding     the  lively interest which I attach to                 re
searches of this nature,         I
                            have been compelled to abandon them
for the present, as they would have led me too far from the
principal object towards which my efforts must be directed.

   As the correction in the distance for S, is approximately equal
to the correction in altitude of S, multiplied by the cosine of the
angle QWT, on VT take from scale the correction of S, in alti
tude = WM, draw NM parallel to QT, then WN is the correction
in distance on the same scale approximately.
   In the same way the angle ZS.S, may be measured, and the
correction of the distance due to the error of altitude of S2 may
be found.
  When the point Z is placed at C the centre of the picture, the
angle on the picture SIZS2 is equal to the original angle SIZS2.
  The point Z may be placed anywhere in the picture, and the
proper construction may be inferred from what precedes; but
then the circle described with radius ZS2 will be replaced by a
conic section, and the angle SIZS, will not be equal to the original
angle SIZS2.

which in    A  was a nucleolus has in B passed into the state        of
nucleus.     The segments in B are nucleolated nuclei. Fig.          C
represents a stage somewhat more advanced ; the nucleus              is
vesicular (its nucleolus parietal).      In D such segments as those
at B and C have divided into        groups    of nucleolated nuclei, g.
In   fig. E some of these   groups    remain;   others have broken up
into single nucleolated nuclei. The latter are arranged so as to
lay the foundation of a membrane, h.            This membrane is the
primary membrane of a cell. (Its elements usually appear first as
mere globules, in which no nucleolus can be discerned, and
which are too minute for examination.) At a later period              I
noticed the state fig. F. In F were nuclei such as those at h
in E, and the nucleoli were most regularly equidistant. Up to
this period the formation of the membrane is incomplete, and
it continues incomplete until fibre forms.            The nucleolated
nuclei h of E and F are the elements of fibre.
    From these drawings it will be seen that, according to my
 observations,   the cell-membrane does not form around the
 nucleus, but is the outer part of the nucleus in an altered state.
 The nucleus, in fact, passes into the condition of a cell. In
 order to this it becomes segmented.         The segments are usually
 globules or granules, too minute for examination. These coalesce
 and thus lay the foundation of a membrane.            But there is one
 nucleus—that in fig. A–the segments of which are of sufficient
 size to show distinctly that they are nuclei themselves, each of
 these having its nucleolus, fig. B.        The great size of the seg
 ments of this nucleus, no doubt, has reference to the functions
 which the cell it passes into is destined to perform, as well as
 to the enormous magnitude which it attains. That cell is my
 ovisac.    It remains to add, that, having discerned traces of a like
 process in the formation even of the most transitory cells, I be
 lieve that the membrane of every cell has the same mode of origin
 as the membrane    of the ovisac.
    When at Giessen in 1852         I  had the pleasure of reading the
  work of Baron     Liebig,  entitled “Untersuchungen über einige
  Ursachen der Säftebewegung im thierischen Organismus, 1848,”
  and pointed out to that justly celebrated man the nucleoli in my
  drawing now reproduced in fig. F, stating to him my belief
  that it represented pores.     I am still of the opinion that in the
  half-formed state of membrane fig. F, nucleoli are the only pores.
  And in proof that such is the case, have only to refer to what       I
  have been maintaining since the year 1840, when, in the Phil.
  Trans. for that year I showed a suctorial power to be manifested
  by the protrusion of the parietal uncovered hyaline nucleolus of
  the germ spot, to take up the equivalent, corresponding, or
  counterpart from the spermatozoon; and to drawings          I gave in

like that of the germ vesicle, presented in the situation of the
nucleolus an orifice+.                      I
                           lately wrote, “In mere nuclei, too, it
is often seen that at the very part where the nucleolus lies the
nucleal investment ceases f.” My belief, indeed,            that                                  is,           at
some period every nucleus has           nucleolus pore.   in    its                    a
I     am anxious     point out connexion between nucleoli and
                             to                       a

between the filaments and       scales,  far more  capacious   than
nucleoli; which larger pores          not suppose          do

different metals, and always with the same result. Now, gold

these are permeable for liquids and gases, but not to allow the
passage through them of any solid substance.                  Thus, with re
ference to the latter, the following enunciation has been given
by Johannes Müller:- “The appearance of globules in secre
tions, presupposes formation of the same at the moment of
separation. They cannot pass out of the blood through the
capillaries*.”       Further, it is said by Henle in his treatise on
“Eiterinfection,”      “I   regard the vascular wall as a hermetically
closed      membrane,     which keeps at a distance from the blood
the exciters to putrefaction—microscopic organismst.”
      The full validity of these enunciations has, however, recently
been called in question, through various physiological and patho
logical facts, which deserve the greatest attention, although no
one has hitherto been able to find for them sufficient explanation.
To these belongs, in the first place, the penetration of the fat
globules into the lacteals and blood-vessels, concerning which it
has with tolerable certainty been shown, that they as such get
through the intestinal walls without previous chemical changef.
 Further, may be mentioned what experience shows to take
 place, the penetration, in the form of minute globules, of the
 mercury contained in blue ointment through the skin into the
 humours, whereof salivation and other symptoms afford proof to
 every physician.        The powerfully healing effects of the rubbing
 in of lard and other fatty ointments, do not well admit of being
 otherwise explained. Now, after the passage of metallic mer
 cury into the blood of animals—partly rubbed into uninjured
 parts of the skin, and partly given them in food—had been
 microscopically shown, which was first done by Osterlenë, who
 arrived at the same result in his experiments with carbon,
 these observations were most fully confirmed by Eberhardt|,
 Mensonides", and Donders”, and extended to the penetration
 of particles of sulphur and starch-granules. So that consequently
 the possibility of the penetration of finely-divided substances

XXXIX.        On the bearing of the Barometrical and Hygrometrical
     Observations at Hobarton and the Cape of Good Hope on the
     general theory of the Variations of Atmospherical Phaenomena.
     By Professor Dove of Berlin+.
I     HAD  hoped to have prefaced this volume with a discussion
     of the meteorological observations made hourly at Hobarton
from January 1841 to September 1848 (of which the abstracts
were published in 1850 in the first volume of the Hobarton
Observations), from the pen of Professor Dove, who had kindly
undertaken, at the magnetical and meteorological conference at
Cambridge in 1845, to participate to that extent in the reduc
tion and application to theoretical conclusions, of the results of
the Observations at the British Colonial Observatories; but
M. Dove’s appointment, on the death of Professor Mahlmann
in November 1848, to the charge of the meteorological obser
vatories in the Prussian states has materially abridged the time
at that gentleman's disposal, and he has found himself unable
to complete the discussion he had undertaken for the present
volume without occasioning an inconvenient delay in its publi
cation; the discussion will therefore be prefixed to the fourth
volume; but in the meantime Professor Dove has kindly fur
nished for this volume the subjoined remarks (written in German)
upon the bearing which the barometrical and hygrometrical
observations, at the Colonial Observatories at Hobarton and the
Cape of Good Hope, have had on the general theory which pro
fesses to explain the physical causes of the variations which we
observe in the atmospherical     phaenomena of the globe.       The
testimony borne by so eminent a meteorologist to the import
ance and value of this portion of the observations made at the
British Colonial Observatories, cannot fail to be highly accept
able to the Government which instituted                      it,

On the theory of the Variations                          of Atmospherical               Phaenomena.            295
     The establishment of meteorological                                    stations        in distant parts

                      those endeavours has even exceeded what
was  hoped for,     besides the information obtained respecting
                                 as
regions where our knowledge was most defective, fresh light has
been thrown                  on
                  those with which we had supposed ourselves
already completely acquainted.
  Meteorology commenced with          the study                    us   by                        of   European

In regard to the magnitude of the annual variation, the following

   4. From the combined action of the variations of the aqueous
vapour and of the dry air we now derive immediately the perio
dical variations of the whole atmospheric pressure.           As the dry
air and the    aqueous  vapour    mixed with it     press  in common on
the barometer, so that the upborne column of mercury consists
of two parts, one borne by the dry air, the other by the aqueous
vapour, we may well understand that as with increasing tempe
rature the air expands, and by reason of              augmented volume          its
rises  higher  and        upper   portion
                                  at     its overflows laterally,–while
 at the same time the increased temperature causes increasing
evaporation, and thus augments the quantity               aqueous vapour              of
in  the  atmosphere,           naturally  sofollows that the composite

which take place        opposite directions that we can determine
                                    in

300     On the theory       of the Variations of Atmospherical   Phaenomena.
The explanation of the last-named phaenomenon, i. e. that of the
northern hemisphere, by a lateral overflow in the upper parts of
                                                   I
the atmosphere, seems so direct, that think we may pronounce
the irregular form of the annual barometric curve in the West
Indies to be a secondary phaenomenon, the primary causes of
which must be looked for on the east.
   8. It is known that in the eruption of the Coseguina on the
20th of January, 1835, when the isthmus of Central America
was shaken by an earthquake, not only were volcanic ashes car
ried to Kingston in Jamaica, a distance of 800 English miles in
the opposite direction to the trade wind, but some of the same
ashes also fell 700 miles to the westward, on board the Conway,
in the Pacific Ocean. We infer, therefore, that in the higher
regions of the atmosphere in the tropics the air is not always
flowing regularly from S.W. to N.E., but that this usual and
regular direction is sometimes interrupted by currents from east
to west.      I
             think I have indicated the probable cause of such
anomalous currents in the above described barometric relations
of the region of the monsoons compared with that of the trades.
If we suppose the upper portions of the air ascending over Asia
and Africa to flow off laterally, and if this takes place suddenly,
it will check the course of the upper or counter current above
the trade wind, and force it to break into the lower current. An
east wind coming into a S.W. current must necessarily occasion
a rotatory movement, turning in the opposite direction to the
hands of a watch.    A rotatory storm moving from S.E. to N.W.
in the lower current or trade, would in this view be the result of
the encounter of two masses of air impelled towards each other
at many places in succession, the further course of the rotation
(originating primarily in this manner) being that described by
me in detail in a memoir “On the Law of Storms,” translated in
the Scientific Memoirs, vol.           iii.

been called Caradoc       sandstone,    were  separated   into two distinct
groups —the lower (Hollybush sandstone and Black shale)
being provisionally called Caradoc sandstone and shale; the

  It   was further stated (loc. cit.         228), that duringp.       former                        a
visit  to the  Horderley     section (made       1842)     had found beds

Pentamerus        orHollies limestone; (2) Caradoc shale; (3) Wen

strenuously opposed              by
                               Professor M'Coy; but           had      oppor           we            no

sandstone   *. I may further state, that during two short visits
to the Onny section, made by my friend John Ruthven and
myself, in the summers of 1846 and 1851, for the sole purpose
of collecting fossils, we did not find a single characteristic Cara
doc species over the Hollies limestone.     The state of the river
had on both occasions been very unfavourable to our examination
of the shales near Stretford Bridge; but my friend Mr. Duppa,
of Cheney Longville, promised        1851)      (in
                                              make excavations      to

waters.   He has since then amply performed his promise, and
his excavations have not laid bare any characteristic Caradoc
species    in the shales immediately above the bridge.                therefore   I
now accept      a  suggestion (more than once made                  Mr. Salter    by
and Prof. M'Coy), that,           my note-book
                                 in                    1842, had mistaken

in  this way the section         ofthe Onny            longer (as
                                                       is      no      will ap         it

May Hill and the Malverns.
    These preliminary remarks will sufficiently explain the pur
pose  of our short visit, made near the end            August (1853),

    My first intention was          re-examine (during the early part

                                                                       I                         by
the way, that these important beds had been carefully laid down
in  1843      byMr. Salter and myself, and were                 that time con

                                as                     After having effected
this first purpose,       I hoped       follow the same grits and sand
                                           to

the Bala limestone; and if we make sections from these highest
beds to the limestones on the two sides of the trough, we find
a discrepancy in thickness which can be readily explained by the
discordant position of the overlying mass, and cannot, think,                              I
be explained any other way.                      I
                                 state this fact from my remem
brance of the sections made by Mr. Salter and myself in 1843.

   Lastly, it is think clear, from a glance over the map of the
Government Survey, that their so-called “Middle Silurian”
group is generally unconformable to the older Cambrian rocks
on which it rests.     It must, therefore, be obvious, that the task
I  had proposed to myself was immediately connected with the
facts and conclusions of my preceding paper (read Nov. 3rd,
1852); but the bad state of my health compelled me, very
reluctantly, to abandon the greater part of                           it.
   There remained, however,         second and shorter task

soft yielding materials (like those just alluded to),                often                it   is

conformity, which may become still more deceptive                    cases                    in
where both the upper and lower masses have been afterwards

                   II.   Pentamerus beds               of Norbury    and         Linley*.
   The extension of these beds along the southern edge of the
 Longmynd chain, upon which they rest unconformably, has been
 well known to geologists since the publication of the “Silurian
 System.’ In Siluria they were discovered, and there they have
their best, and perhaps their only unequivocal type. Their
thickness is not great, and at Linley and Norbury the thickness
might, on a superficial view, be easily overrated, inasmuch as
the beds dip very nearly with the inclination of the ground, and
therefore are spread over a considerable surface.     It would be
idle for me to attempt any detailed description of these well
known beds; but I may just remark, -(1) That some of the
lowest beds are very irregular, coarse, and of mechanical struc
ture, and with very few traces of fossils. (2) That over the
above are five or six feet of a bluish-gray ragstone: the beds
with very uneven upper and lower surfaces, separated by semi
indurated wayboards, marked by many ferruginous stains, and
with a few casts of fossils.   (3) That higher in the section are
five or six feet of gray and yellowish-gray beds, slightly ferrugi
nous, and with many cellular streaks marking the presence of
fossil casts; also bands of ferruginous “rotten-stone,” with                                        in
numerable casts of fossils. As usual, the calcareous matter had
quite disappeared from the “rotten-stone” bands.          (4) That
over the above comes the well-known and beautiful Pentamerus
(or Norbury) limestone.         This limestone        the Norbury          is,   in
quarries, extensively worked for the neighbouring lime-kilns.
The beds are very irregularly deposited, but their average thick
                          six feet. The preceding group plunges

                                Linley and Norbury.
  First of all, we may remark that we have, especially in                     some
of the upper beds, the Pentamerus oblongus and the Pentamerus
lavis in infinite abundance. Here, indeed (as I believe also at
the Hollies and other well-known localities), they seem to have
in a great measure supplied the calcareous matter of the lime
stone.   But in addition to these two abundant fossils, and after
rejecting many specimens which were too imperfect to give secure
results, Prof. M'Coy determined the following species, the list of
which is here given in his own words:–
  “Ptylodictya lanceolata (as at Dudley).
  Palaeopora        interstincta     (common       to Cambrian and Silurian
rocks).
  Favosites multiporatus (do.).
  Petraia bina (as in Wenlock limestone and May Hill sandstone).
  P. bina, an unnamed species (same as at May Hill). .
  Encrinurus punctatus (common to Cambrian and Silurian
rocks).
   Leptana transversalis (as in the Wenlock limestone of Wool
hope, Dudley, and in the May Hill sandstone).
   Leptana euglypha (Wenlock limestone and Dudley limestone).
  Orthis elegantula (common to Cambrian and Silurian rocks).
  O. pecten (do.).                         -
  O. Davidsoni (Wenlock limestone of Walsall and May Hill
sandstone).
  Spirigerina reticularis (Cambrian, Silurian and Devonian).
  Littorina Octavia (same as in Wenlock limestone).”
  Upon this list I may remark, that out of fifteen carefully de
termined species, eight have not yet, so far as I have heard, been
found except in the Wenlock group or                     its
                                           equivalents; and that,
of the remaining seven species, one ranges                      to up
                                                     the Devonian       to
rocks inclusive. The remaining six belong       species which were
already    known      to   be  both
                                common Cambrian and Silurian
                                                    to
rocks.     And lastly, that             all
                             those very abundant types, which
have hitherto been found eaclusively   the Bala and other un
                                                   in
doubted Cambrian groups, are here entirely wanting. We found
 noother examples          of
                   species common                       to
                                        Cambrian and Silurian
                                by
                                     a no
rocks. But we were        means surprised
                                                                  at to
                                               find several well
known common species       deposit which

Wenlock shale.          Itthe exact locality where we should have
                             is
expected    tofind such species.
   By itself, this evidence might not                   be
                                            considered sufficient                  to
prove that the Norbury group                  is   be
                                         cut off from the Caradoc

this evidence cannot be taken by itself. It it be called doubtful,
there is other evidence in reserve which is not doubtful, and which,
I think, proves that this Norbury group is an integral part of
the May Hill sandstone; that it is unconformable to the Cam
brian rocks where the sections are most complete; and that it
does form a portion of those important arenaceous and shelly
deposits which are, both physically and palaeontologically, the
true base of          all
                 the overlying Silurian groups*.

                     I                                 1842) that the
Caradoc shale extended, they found many Wenlock fossils un
mixed with any older types. Prof. M'Coy's notes are         follows:—             as
   “1.          In

of the seetion.

     4.   “About thirty yards higher       the river up

beds   of Horderley.”
    In the above section the highest beds are undoubted Wenlock
shale.    The lower beds (groups 3,4 and 5) are undoubted Cam
brian (one of the upper sandstones of the Bala group). The
intermediate, or May Hill group, is lost.                     -
    There is therefore no contradiction in the section to the views
given in my previous paper of Nov. 3, 1852. We have no alter
nation of true Cambrian and true Silurian types; and              I now
believe that the Trinucleus shale laid bare by an excavation a
little above Longville Bridge, was (by an error in my notes in
 1842) placed a little above Stretford Bridge. This conclusion
I  should have come to sooner, had        I  dared to coax my notes into
an   agreement     with  my  subsequent   views.
IV.    Sections near Shineton through a part of the Caradoc terrace,
               a few miles to the north-west of Wenlock.
    What    I had   first thought the most important object of our
excursion    was to examine the whole Caradoc terrace between the
Onny and the Severn, in order that we might learn whether
there existed in that district any unequivocal traces of the May
 Hill sandstone interposed between the true Caradoc beds and
the Wenlock shale.          I  thought it probable when my former
paper was written (Nov. 1852), that here (as in the lower part of
 Glyn Ceiriog) the Wenlock shale might by an overlap have been
brought immediately into contact with the true Caradoc group.
But before we commenced our excursion, we learnt from Mr.
Salter, who had just before visited the country near Wenlock,
that the previous conjecture was erroneous, and that there did
exist at Shineton and other places along the Caradoc terrace, a
series of beds which represented the May Hill sandstone.             He
gave us his best localities, and a short list of the fossils he had
 collected from them; and he added his conviction, that these
 so-called May Hill beds at the base of the Wenlock shale were
 unconformable to the contiguous parts of the true Caradoc
 sandstone.
             I
    While was still unable to take the field, Prof. M'Coy not
only traversed the north-eastern end of the Caradoc terrace, but
completely verified the previous observations of Mr. Salter; and
 I will give the result of his observations in his own words.
    (1) “On the road-side, close to Shineton Church, are olive
 coloured shales which dip about 35° E. of south, and at about
 30°. They were found to contain the following fossils:—
    Agnostus pisiformis (as at Llandeilo, &c.) in great abundance.

                 and the Palaeozoic System       of England.              311
    Olenus”? (same species as at Hollybush,_Malvern sections
of Phillips).
    Asaphus *, undetermined fragments.
    Cytheropsis Aldensis (as at Aldens on the Stincher, N. B.).
    Siphonotreta      micula (as at Wellsfield near Builth, and a
                                                                              -
Pentre, north of Llangynyw).
    All the above are Cambrian types.
    (2.) “Over these olive shales, and also over some black
shalest, with a few traces of Fuci and Orthoceratites in Belswar
dine Brook, are several thin beds of May Hill sandstone and
Pentamerus limestone.            Dip about 50° E. of south, at 20°. The
fossils observed were,
    Hemithyris     hemisphaerica.
    Pentamerus      lavis.
            oblongus.
    Petraia (unnamed species, same as at May Hill and Malvern).
    (3.)   “One mile     west    of Harley are olive-coloured shales, like
those of Shineton, and with nearly the same dip and strike.
They are overlaid (with a small degree of unconformity) by very
coarse unfossiliferous May Hill conglomerates; exactly like
those which appear at the base of the May Hill sandstone near
the top of May Hill. They are seen in numerous openings
along the road to Church Green.
    (4.) “Beneath the above conglomerates, in large quarries near
Harmage Grange, the true Caradoc sandstone and limestone are
both found, dipping 10° E. of South, at about 20°, and full of
the following fossilsf.
           Orthis eapamsa.                        Orthis parva.
                    vespertilio,
                    elegantula, var. a.            —     Actoniae.
                                                         bilobata.
All of which are exclusively Cambrian.”
    Such were Prof. M'Coy's notes.               His excursion was made
during a day of almost unrelenting rain, otherwise his fossil lists
would have been more complete.                 The above facts, combined
   * This   was one of the species in Mr. Salter's list.
   f   In these black shales (as in those of Holly Bush described by Professor
 Phillips) have been several ignorant trials for coal.
                                               I
   † Professor M'Coy does not assert (as stated by mistake to the Geo
logical Society) that the sandstones near Harnage Grange underlie the olive
coloured Olenus shales of Shimeton.       He merely states facts, and leaves in
doubt the eract sectional position of the shales.     But he regarded them as
probably forming the base of the Caradoc terrace which extends from
 Horderley to the Severn. The fossils of the olive-coloured shales evidently
 indicate their true position, and prove them to be on the same parallel with
 the beds at Builth and Llandeilo.         I was led into the mistake above
 mentioned by the shortness of Professor M'Coy's notes, and by finding
 that Shineton was close to the Wenlock terrace on the Geological Map.

    312               Prof. Sedgwick on the May Hill Sandstone,
    with those previously observed by Mr. Salter, were, however,
    sufficient for our purpose, and enabled us to draw the following
    conclusions:—                          -
       (1.) There can now be very little doubt about the geological
    place of the Hollybush Olenus shales.     They are where   had                      I
    provisionally placed them in my last paper; adopting without
    reserve the published views                 of Professor Phillips, who first dis
    covered and described them.
       Near Shineton, there is nothing in the sections to indicate
    the protrusion of any very ancient rock; nor any igneous rock
    (like the Malvern syenite) to disturb the relations of the neigh
    bouring strata.     Hence it appears certain that the Shineton
    beds (although inferior to the above-mentioned beds of Harnage
    Grange) must be arranged with the shales which form the base
    of the Horderley or Caradoc terrace; in which case they must
    be subordinate to the Bala group.
        The note of interrogation after the word Olenus in the pre
    vious list may perhaps show that Prof. M'Coy is not certain as
    to the genus; but, whatever it may be hereafter called, he is certain
    that it is identical with the Olenus of the Hollybush shales.
        (2.) The (supposed) typical section through Caer Caradoc,
    Wenlock Edge, &c., is not a truly continuous, but a broken
    section.    The true Caradoc sandstone and Caradoc shale do not
    graduate into the beds which immediately surmount them; and
    the conglomerates, grits, and Pentamerus limestone, &c. (which
    discordantly overlie the true Caradoc sandstone) must here, as
    at the south end of the Malvern Hills, be cut off from the Cara
    doc terrace and arranged with the Wenlock group.
-       (3.) From the above facts, and from          have seenall
                                                               I   learnt          or

    neighbouring English counties,        think may conclude, that

   Now if the groups 2, 3, 4, 5, &c. be unbroken and con
tinuous, we can only account for the position of the Cambrian
group (No. 1) by the hypothesis of a great fault; and in this
way, and this way only, can we bring the beds (No. 1) into co
ordination with their supposed place in the ideal vertical section
(fig. 5).
   As a matter of fact, however, there is no necessity for the in

316                    Prof. Sedgwick on                   the       May Hill Sandstone,
The establishment of the May Hill sandstone, as a true Silurian
group, does away at once with                                  all
                                        these three assumptions.
   For several     years  after the publication      the “Silurian Sy                 of
stem,”   I believed   that, between the lower    groups     the Silurian                        of
system and the upper Cambrian groups, there was              overlap,                              an                  or

gradually produced an extinction of many of the older and
most characteristic organic types.   And in the discordant posi
tion of the overlying May   Hill sandstone, we have not only the
proof of great anterior mechanical movements among the upper
Cambrian groups, but in it we find the commencement of a new
succession of the regular Silurian deposit; and along with this
new physical succession we find a co-ordinate change of the
organic types.        For in the May Hill sandstone the old cha
racteristic  organic   types have suddenly disappeared; and in their
place we have another set of types, which are characteristic of
the lower groups of Siluria.           In short (to use a language now
in common      use),  we have in this way the introduction of a new
“system,” physically and palaeontologically distinct from the
whole system of Cambria.

  THE“On        the Effect of the Pressure    of the Atmosphere on the
  Mean Level of the Ocean.”          By Captain Sir James Clark Ross,  .
  R.N., F.R.S.
     The author states that, in September 1848, Her Majesty's ships
 Enterprize and Investigator having anchored in the harbour of Port
 Leopold in lat. 74° N. and long. 91° W., a heavy pack of ice was
 driven down upon and completely closed the harbour's mouth, thus
 effectually preventing their egress, and compelling them there to
 pass the winter of 1848–49.        It was during that period that the
 series of observations here presented to the Royal Society was ob
 tained; and, as the observations were made under peculiarly favour
 able circumstances, the author considers they will throw some light
 on the movements of the tides, and on some of the causes of their
 apparent irregularities.
     Soon after the harbour had been completely frozen over, a very
 heavy pressure from the main pack forced the newly-formed sheet
 of ice, which covered the bay, far up towards its head, carrying
 the ships with it into such shallow water that at low spring-tides
 their keels sometimes rested on the ground.        Under these circum
 stances the movements of the tides became to the author an object
 of great anxiety, and consequently of careful observation, in order
 to ascertain the amount of irregularities to which they were liable
 in that particular locality.
    The first few days' observations evidenced much larger differences
 in the elevation or depression of successive high or low-waters than
 could be accounted for by any of the generally received causes of
 disturbance; and the author was at once led to connect them with
 changes of the pressure of the atmosphere, from perceiving that on
the days of great atmospheric pressure high-water was not so high
as it ought to have been, and low-water was lower than its proper
height; and that the reverse took place on the days of smaller
pressure.
    As it was found that the usual method of determining the mean
level of the sea, by taking the mean of successive high- and low
waters, was inadequate to the detection of small quantities arising
from a change in the pressure, a system of observation was adopted
different from that heretofore practised, in order to determine the
mean level of the sea on each day.
    In the first instance, simultaneous observations of the height of
the tide and of the mercury in the barometer were made every
quarter of an hour throughout the twenty-four hours. - From these
it was found that the mean level of the sea for each day could be
determined with great accuracy, and that the variation in the daily
                                                             *

mean level and in the mean pressure of the atmosphere followed
each other in a remarkable manner, so that a rise in the former cor
responded to a diminution in the latter.           Subsequently however
hourly observations were adopted.
     The peculiar advantages of the position of the ships at Port Leo
pold for making tidal observations are stated to have consisted in    :-
     1. The great width of the entrance of the harbour admitting
the free ingress and egress of the water, combined with the large
field of ice which covered the whole of the bay, completely subduing
every undulation of the water.
     2. The steady movement of the immense platform of ice, rising
and falling with such singular regularity and precision as to admit
the reading off the marks of the tide-pole with the greatest exactness,
even to the tenth of an inch.
     3. The shallowness of the water and the evenness and solidity
of the clay bottom admitting the fixture of the tide-pole with im
moveable firmness.
     4. The whole surface of the sea in the neighbourhood being, for
the greater part of the time, covered by a sheet of ice, preventing
 those irregularities which occur in other localities from the violence
 of the wind raising or depressing the sea in as many different de
 grees as it varied in strength or duration.
     For fixing the tide-pole for the “Enterprize” a hole 2 feet square
 was cut through the icy platform, and a strong pole, nearly 40 feet
 long, was passed through it and driven firmly down several feet into
 the clay, being fixed by heavy iron weights, which also rested on
 the clay and prevented any movement of the pole.         It was placed in
 about 21 feet      depth of water at the time of mean level of the sea.
 Another such tide-pole was, in a like manner, fixed through a hole
 in the ice close to the “Investigator,” for the sake of reference and
 comparison.            -
      Hourly observations of the height of the tide and of the barometer
 were commenced on the 1st of November, and were continued by
  the officers of each ship throughout the whole of the nine following
  months to the end of July.        After forty-seven days of observation
 an    interruption   in one of the series occurred in consequence of the
 tide-pole of the “Enterprize” having been drawn up by the ice, to
 the under part of which it had become frozen.         The amount of dis
  placement of the pole was easily determined by a comparison with
 that of the “Investigator,” but several days elapsed before it could
  be satisfactorily fixed at the same point in which it had been origi
  mally. The observations of these forty-seven days are those which
  are given in the paper, and their discussion is the immediate object
  of the communication.
      It is stated that subsequent observations seem to show that, from
   the time of the interruption to the middle of July, there was a pro
   gressive elevation of the mean level of the sea, which, although of
   small amount, was sufficiently evident from month to month to
   render the subdivision of the series desirable, in order that the indi
   vidual observations of each separate division should be strictly com
   parable.

   The height of the sea and the corresponding height of the mer.
cury in the barometer, at every hour in each day, from the 1st No
vember to the 18th December 1848 are given in tables.         In these
the arithmetic mean of the hourly heights of the sea for each day is
taken as the mean level of the sea for that day, and the mean of
the hourly heights of the barometer is taken as the corresponding
height of the barometer.     These mean levels and corresponding
mean barometric heights are given in another two-columm table,
arranged in the order of the days of observation; and in a third
table these are arranged in the order of the heights of the barometer
with the corresponding mean levels, without regard to the dates of
observation, for the purpose of showing the dependence which the
latter have on the former.                                        --
   On these tables the author makes the following remarks. The
forty-seven days of hourly observations give for the mean height of
the barometer 29.874 inches, and of the mark of the mean level of
the sea 21 feet 0:21 in.

      NOTE   ON  THE PRODUCTION OF PYRO-ELECTRIC CURRENTS.
                              BY M. BECQUEREL.
THE         disengagement of electricity is produced by various means—
       friction, heat, light, the action of magnets, induction, molecular
and chemical actions, &c. I have endeavoured to produce the electric
force by combining the action of heat with that of the affinities.
My expectations have been realized; I have succeeded in producing
currents which I shall call pyro-electric currents, by analogy with
the currents obtained in the ordinary batteries, and to distinguish
them from the thermo-electric currents, which are due to heat alone.
    These currents, which have a constant power as long as the tem
perature does not vary very sensibly, are produced whenever solid
 metallic or other substances, conductors of electricity, are in contact
 with glass or any other vitreous substance in a state of igneous fusion,
 or softened by heat; but the greatest effect takes place only when
 the substance is fused.
     In the memoir which I presented to the Academy on the 1st of May
 last, on the disengagement of electricity in chemical actions*, I
 showed that glass even at a slightly elevated temperature began to
 conduct electrical currents, and that this property might be made
 use of to study the disengagement of electricity produced by the
 contact of platinum wires with flame. This conductibility begins to
 be sensible at about 482°F.         I have since tried to ascertain whether,
  this conducting power increasing with the temperature, it would not
  be possible when the glass is fused, or even before this takes place,
  to substitute it for the acids and saline solutions in voltaic batteries.
  I operated in the following manner: —
     First experiment.—If a rod of soft iron and a rod of copper be intro
  duced into a furnace filled with lighted coals, each of them being in
  communication with the ends of the wire of an ordinary multiplier,

by means of an iron and a copper wire, the magnetic needle is not
deviated, whatever may be the temperature. But it is very different
if the copper rod be inclosed in a tube of hard glass, and the
temperature be brought to the point of fusion of the latter.               If a
multiplier and a tangent galvanometer be placed in the circuit, it is
 seen that long before the glass has become red-hot, the needle of the
 multiplier deviates; by continuing the heat up to the melting-point,
 the intensity of the current constantly increases, attains a maximum,
 and remains constant. Long before this it is necessary to take away
 the multiplier and only make use of the tangent galvanometer; this
 current is directed from the iron to the copper, across the charcoal
 and glass; that is to say, the iron during its oxidation disengages
 negative electricity, and the copper, of which the surface remains
 clear and bright, evolves positive electricity.          Thus the copper,
 although exposed to a high temperature, remains intact, as is also
 the case when, in contact with zinc or iron, it is immersed in an
 oxidizing liquid. It is consequently indebted to            electro-negative      its
           for   its
                preservation                        an

 state                                 elevated                   The current
remains constant         long   as  the temperature undergoes         sensible                      no
variation and the iron does not become covered with                thick layer                 a
of   oxide; but should the tube partially fuse and the copper touch
the iron,        all
               the signs      electricity disappear. This fact proves that

the current       not thermo-electric.

exactly, it is necessary to determine, by means of Ohm's law, the
conductive power of the sources themselves.      The experiments
which I have hitherto made show, that under the most favourable
circumstances, when the temperature approaches the melting-point
of copper, the conductive power of the two sources is nearly the same,

gradually increases in the pyro-electric couple.                            .        .

    Sixth experiment.—In the pyro-electric couples just described,
copper has been employed             the electro-negative element; but
platinum and coke may also                        be as
                                    used, although both        them present                     byof
certain   disadvantages.    The   platinum      attacked       the glass and

disintegrated; the coke burns very slowly and produces                current                              a
in  the opposite direction, which diminishes the action          the current                         of

get rid  of  this inconvenience       introducing    by

this body that     I
               give the name of hydrocyanaldine.     is insipid, has It
no reaction upon vegetable colours, dissolves in water, aether, and
more   readily in alcohol.    It fuses at a low temperature, and sub
limes at a moderate    heat;   when briskly heated it is decomposed with
an   odour,  analogous  to that of hydrocyanic acid. The solution of
this  body  is not precipitated  by salts of silver, even after the addition
of nitric acid; but when the solution is heated with silver salts,
cyanide of silver is precipitated and aldehyde developed.             When
heated with potash, hydrocyanaldine evolves ammonia, and the solu
tion becomes brown, with separation of resin of aldehyde.
   The analysis of hydrocyanaldine gave me the formula C9H8 Nº
or C18H19N*, and its formation is expressed by the equation—
3(C. H. O. NH3)4-3C,            HN+2HCl=Cls H* Nº 4-2NH. Cl 4-6HO.
Aldehyd.    ammonia.
     This exhibits some analogy with the formation of thialdine,—
        3(C. H. O. NH3)4-6HS=Cls His NS++2NH4SH-6HO.
   Hydrocyanaldine nevertheless differs greatly from thialdine, espe
cially because it has not distinct basic properties; at least I have
not succeeded in preparing saline compounds of this body.—Comptes

XLIII.      Observations on Meteorolites or Aérolites, considered Geo

IT iscomplete list of well-authenticated
           many years since any attempt       has been made to give a
                                                meteoric falls; recently,
indeed, M. Partsch of Vienna has published an interesting ac
count, as well as catalogue, of the meteoric irons and stones in
the Imperial Museum of that city; and Professor Shepard of the
United States has also given us a list of the meteorites in his
own collection, as well as a thesis on American meteorites; but
I   am ignorant of anything approaching a complete or compen
 dious catalogue of the falls of these bodies.
     The accompanying catalogue has been carefully compiled from
various sourcest; where possible, concise particulars, not only as
to date and locality are given, but mention is also made of weights,
specific gravity, appearances, &c.; and several analytical and sta
tistical tables are added, which may not be without importance
in the present as well as future consideration of this subject.
     Great care has been taken to avoid erroneous dates or con
fusion of localities; and queries are occasionally annexed, where
there wants evidence to establish fully the authenticity or cor
 rectness of the fall.

    It is more especially my present object to investigate some
of the results apparently indicated by these tables, constructed
purposely from the general catalogue; and            shall consider the             I
subject, first geographically, i. e. with regard to the geographical
distribution or deposition of acrolites on the surface of the globe;
secondly, statistically, with reference to dates and numbers; and
                 I
thirdly, if may use the term, cosmically.
   Considerable allowance must be made in the following, as in
deed in       all
              considerations respecting these singular bodies; but
I am     ofopinion that the number        falls now brought together
                                                           of
in tabulated form will be sufficient to furnish us with some
    a
evidence,      indeed only
                if               negative kind,
                                         of      a    start from. The              to
three following tables tend          prove the not otherwise than

332            Mr. R. P. Greg on Meteorolites or Aérolites,
might appear from a too superficial or limited examination, that
such was not the case, a view, indeed, apparently adopted by
Professor Shepard, in some remarks he published in 1850, re
specting the “Geographical Distribution” of these bodies. He
considers that there are some regions of the earth’s surface,
or certain zones, towards or in which there is a tendency to
“concentration in the deposition” of meteoric matter; and he
instances particular countries, as Canada, Portugal, Spain, South
Italy, Sicily, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and North
ern Russia, which furnish few or no instances of meteoric depo
sition.    As regards Canada and Norway only, can his remarks,
I  consider, strictly hold good, as will be admitted on a perusal
of the localities given in the catalogue accompanying this paper:
that there are some irregularities no one will deny, yet consider
ing the strange nature                 of,
                              and the phaenomena exhibited by, these
bodies, and making due allowance for various causes likely                                             to
affect    anobservable uniformity        deposition,

able how uniformly they have everywhere been observed”.
    Professor Shepard correctly takes for the United States the
parallel     of
              37°         N,
                         the line

 an  angle     of

I     shall now    quote Prof. Shepard's own words:–
    “If   then      appears
                     it      that these aérial strangers alight upon

and reasons for so doing.
   It would indeed be strange should these bodies, varying in
size and weight from half an ounce to 30,000 lbs., sometimes
containing no iron at all, and occasionally composed of nothing
but iron, with an oblique direction generally from east to west,
and a velocity of fifteen to thirty miles in a second,-be attracted
by particular countries more than others, or arrange themselves
in zones parallel to the isothermal or isodynamic lines.

several comparative dissimilarities result. The marked poverty      of
of meteors observed     March and May does not agree with the
                                   in
number      acrolites observed for the same months,

Table D., where March has over the average and May about the
average number, for the whole year.

                    This may perhaps        the result      chance, but                               of
not    sowhen we take the months             August and November
(Table E.); these two months show decided and even enormous          a
preponderance      the number
                        in         luminous meteors observed, owing
                                                   of
principally     the periodic displays which usually take place from
                  to
the 9th     to
             the 13th              of
                          each month.
   Referring now      Table D.,
                             to      will     observed that the num
                                                     it                       be

                             acrolites ascertained       have fallen for                         to
these two   months,  barely exceeds the   average     the whole twelve                      of
months.
   This deserves some attention, since out             more than 150                        of
meteorites (or acrolites) whose precise date        fall are well ascer                    of
tained, there are but four (see Table F.) which fell          any    the                                    on              of
twelve  days  included between the 9th       14th days      August  and   to                          of
November respectively.       From this we are,      think, justified                   I                                           in
drawing the conclusion, that, with many phaenomena                 com                                             in

336              Mr. R. P. Greg             on Meteorolites           or Aérolites,
pose to be somewhat of the same character as that existing be
tween planet and comet; the former composed of matter in a
solid form and revolving round the sun in orbits less elliptical
than the latter, but more so than those of the larger planets, the
latter having also a gaseous or perhaps fluid mature.
   Some attempts have been made to ascertain the orbits of the
periodically recurring meteor showers of August and September,
and Professor Olmstead calculated that the one seen on the night
of the 13th of November 1833, had                          its
                                          aphelion near the earth's
orbit, and        its
              perihelion within the orbit    Mercury; that          of                                  is,   its
mean distance from the sun lies within the earth’s orbit.       (See

   new and important step gained towards         just consideration
of a

 I    have just expressed the opinion that there probably existed
a difference between aérolites and luminous meteors or meteoric
showers, and based that opinion partly                              on
                                                   the fact that there                                        is

epochs for luminous meteors; and                               on
                                               comparing the aérolite
epochs (see notes        and                b,

                  e.     asprincipally without the earth’s orbit.
 I   am not now     proposing    any new theory, but only supporting
and carrying out the supposition long ago entertained                                                         by
Dr. Chladni, and since then advocated                           by
                                                 most astronomers, that
meteoric stones are     true,  though    minute,   planetary fragments;
but from want        data,    of        no
                                serious attempt       anything amount       at
ing    to
        demonstrative     proof has yet been made; and there are
now many scientific men who attribute                        atmospheric               an
                                                                    is to
                                                   them
or lunar origin.     When, therefore, there        still    much conjec            so

    considered Geographically,                  Statistically, and Cosmically.                              337
ture and so much confusion respecting the nature, origin and
phaenomena of these bodies, any ray of light is acceptable to the
theorist, and anything like fact or tabulated statistics, of value.
In continuation, then, and in search of further evidence, this
part of our subject may also be incidentally considered in another
way.
    The average specific gravity of about seventy stonesl     find                                      I
to be 3-4, the highest being about 3.95 and the lowest 17; but
as those possessing the smallest specific gravity are necessarily
the most destructible and fragile, and after meteoric explosion
less likely to arrive on the surface of the earth in an entire or
tangible state, we may very fairly take their average density
nearer the mean of these two extremes, say 3-0.
   We may now construct a table of densities (taking water as                                                     1),
which    not without interest,
        is                       perhaps bearing  as the subject                            on
in hand.

     1.    “The excentricities of                   the orbits of the known asteroids can
suffer very small changes as the effect of perturbation.   These
excentricities, which are now quite large, have then always been
and will always remain large.
   2. “The same is true of the inclination of their orbits; so
that the amount of excentricity and inclination answers to the
primitive conditions of the formation of the group.
   8. “These propositions are only true for distances from the
sun above 2:00.     An asteroid situated between Mars and the
distance of about 2:00 would not be stable in the meaning which
is attached to that word in celestial mechanics.
    “Flora, which is nearest to the sun of the known asteroids, is
2:20 distant. M. Le Verrier also observes that it is remarkable
that a planet has been found almost up to the line which theory
assigns as the limit of stability, and that none have been found
beyond         it.
                Must we believe that the same cause which has
given origin         tomany asteroids above the distance 2:00, has
                           so

should obtain for the same substance a different birefractive

negative, which is inadmissible.
   It might be hoped that these researches would conduct to
some simple ratio between the birefractive power which may be
called specific, and the other properties of the body. My first
experiments, which were made with some specimens of glass only,
had furnished a sensibly constant value for the birefractive power;
and if this constancy had been general, important consequences
relative to the distribution of force in bodies naturally birefractive
would have flowed from                        it.
                                  But since these first experiments,                                                I

For the plate of spar we have

                                               P=E.
It  would therefore be necessary to apply to the plate of crown a
pressure of 6220 kilogrammes to each square millimetre of                                                    the
transverse section perpendicular    the thickness; that  to   say,                                is   to
a  pressure more than    thousand times  greater than that which
would crush the glass   pieces.        to a

tity                       corresponds,             in the formulae of M. Neumann, to

*—we           find it equal to 0-157 by the old formulae, and equal to
0.168 by the new ones; this latter differs much less from the
value 0-191 which we have obtained by direct experiment.
But the difference becomes still less when we take into account
that M. Neumann has applied his calculation to the means of
measurements    taken on two bands which were not of the same
description of glass; further, in their composition the glasses of
Germany employed by M. Neumann differ sufficiently from those
of France to prevent the values of E and of C from remaining
the same. A band of Bohemian glass has given me, by means
of transversal vibrations, a coefficient of mechanical elasticity of-
6594, which is notably superior to that of our glasses.

                                  of

                                          cases convince ourselves
that the rotation has completely disappeared when the difference

presents     itself infallibly whenever we make use of thin plates; it
is impossible to render the surfaces between which the pressure
is exerted so completely plane and parallel that they shall rigor
ously produce nothing more than an effect of compression.       It
is therefore necessary that the glass itself offer sufficient resist
ance to flexure to cause its effect to become insensible, and this
is attained by giving the plate a thickness (height) of from 2 to
3 centimetres.   It is hardly possible to obtain by refoulement so
thick a glass; on the other hand, the cast glasses always present
a great number of striae in a direction perpendicular to their
pressure, which is the precise direction in which they would be
traversed by the light.                  I

of several layers of plate glass placed one upon the other;

dually ascend through the whole series of tints, and with a press
ure of 26,000 we shall come to zero.    Consequently, and with
out  adding  anything to the optical  apparatus,  we can proceed
anew to a negative double refraction                         of Tº     which would be ob
tained with a total pressure of 39,000 kilogrammes, and so on.
   This apparatus appears to me capable of being employed in a
great number of scientific experiments, and it would enable
engineers to graduate in a rigorous manner manometers, safety
valves, and other instruments of measurement which are ha
bitually applied.
   I will confine myself to citing a few examples.
   With two small screws turned by the fingers merely, we can
produce a pressure of 220 kilogrammes.
   To copy a letter with an ordinary copying-press, a pressure of
800 to 900 kilogrammes is usually exerted.

   We have denoted by P' the force which is applied to one arm
of the lever, and by P the effect produced; the constant quan
tity 66.5, which is independent of the force P, represents the
inertia of the instrument and the friction in the screw which
corresponds to this inertia:                    if,

whatever       P',    we
                   remove the   force,  the pressure will not entirely
disappear;     coloration still exists corresponding       pressure            to

66.5 kilogrammes, which evidently arises from the inertia
the apparatus. We see, then, that this force, which generally                       is
neglected,     may certain cases become very considerable.

  The first numbers were obtained with the piece of flint No. 13,
and it was not until 1000 kilogrammes had been reached that
we made use of the larger piece of plate glass. The only difficulty
consists in always having two plates, one fixed and the other

                  have subjected to compression a parallelopiped,
very little different from a cube, cut from a perfectly pure dia
mond, and of which two pairs of faces were exactly parallel to
each other; the three dimensions of this parallelopiped are 2.847,
2.874, and 2.760 millimetres*.       After having eliminated, as
much as possible, the effect of the very emergetic laminar polar
ization in this diamond, we find as means of six experiments
which were made by taking successively each of the dimensions
for height, for width and for length, the following numbers:–
PA                                       PA                              Ps

and finally, the coefficient of optic elasticity C=43985; we have
besides Io-2,470 (Brewster), but the value of I, is unknown.
Let it be remarked, however, that for all the bodies which we
have examined, the value                      of the ratio          lººk varies         between 0.04
and 0-14; hence, assuming for the diamond a value equal to
that of fluor-spar, or in round numbers, equal to 0-1, we shall
have          Ie-I,
              =0.247 and E= 10865.     The coefficient of elasti
city of diamond would thus be nearly equal to that of copper,
and not at              all
                   proportion  in great hardness.   to   its
  C.         Determination          of   the length       of   an   undulation     of     a   given light,
     We have already remarked that these experiments furnish                                            us

are  not rigorously equal to each other, nor exactly proportional
to the weights, as long as the latter are small; but these dif
ferences disappear as the charges become more considerable, and
long before any sensible permanent changes have been produced.
    Ifwe take the weights as abscissae, and the lengthenings or
shortenings corresponding as ordinates, the first below, and the
second above, two similar, if not equal curves, will be obtained,
the first of which is convex, and the second concave towards
the axis of the abscissae; the curves straighten insensibly, and,
for linear changes hardly measurable by ordinary means, become
confounded with a straight line, which proves the proportionality
between the charges and their temporary effects.         These facts
are confirmed by direct experiments made by different observers,
experiments the results of which were however too uncertain to
be regarded as a demonstration of the law. This confirmation
is exhibited in a notable degree by the experiments of Mr.
Hodgkinson, when they are calculated with reference to the
temporary effects alone, and when we take into account the
sources of error which influence                  all

   Neither of those laws indicates any particular relation between

A*       a sequel to the previous details,       subjoin the following
        remarks on the classification and nomenclature of the
British palaeozoic rocks. The triple division of our whole series
of fossil-bearing rocks into primary, secondary, and tertiary,
may still be conveniently retained; and, when these three divi
sions are described with reference to their organic types, they
have been respectively defined by the terms palaeozoic, mesozoic,
and canozoic.     To each of the three great divisions would, on                             I
palaeontological grounds, give the name of System.            Thus, in
the following corrected tabular view,            the palaeozoic rocks, all
from the oldest Cambrian          the Permian inclusive, are described
                                            to
as  forming parts       one system—the Palaeozoic.

other a similar succession of organic types, and each might have
its appropriate nomenclature. Nature has been so true to her
workmanship, that the two would, with a very few exceptions,
run harmoniously together. But in the actual state of our
information, we have done well constantly to use both kinds of
evidence; and on both together has our best, and our only
consistent and secure, momenclature been founded. If it be
true that experienced geologists have sometimes, from the
neglect of palaeontology, blundered in the arrangement of phy
sical groups, it is equally true, that very expert palaeontologists,
from some mistake of arrangement among the physical groups,
have sometimes blundered in their palaeontology.   The double
kind of evidence above described, has seldom been lost sight of
                                                                -
with impunity.
   We have, within a few years, had an excellent illustration of
the combined value of physical and fossil evidence, in the defini
tion of our oldest tertiary groups, and in the determination of
their nomenclature by Mr. Prestwich; and principles precisely
similar have led to a good geographical nomenclature of the
great subdivisions of our whole palaeozoic system.         So far as
our palaeozoic nomenclature is good, and fitted to endure, it has
been grounded both on physical and palaeontological evidence.
So far as it is inadequate or erroneous, it has either been derived
from sections which were misinterpreted, or from a positive de
sertion of those principles of combined evidence on which all
the good and enduring parts of our palaeozoic momenclature are
grounded.

    Immediately above these three groups there is a great change
of physical conditions.               The most characteristic old organic
types disappear, and new types take their place.                       The sections
 are usually broken and discontinuous; and the upper (or Silu
rian) groups sometimes overlap the lower (or Cambrian) groups.
 Here, therefore (to adopt a language in common use), we have
the commencement of a new system.
   * The Longmynd slates are here arranged with the Bangor group, partly
 on the authority of the Government Survey. The other Cambrian groups
are exclusively from my own observations.           In a letter, published as an Ap
 pendix to a Guide to the Lakes (Hudson, Kendal, June 1853),              I have used
 the following words:–“After the granitic rocks of Wales, we have Meta
morphic and Hypozoic rocks. The Metamorphic, of a great, but some
what doubtful age, and of great thickness.               The Hypozoic rocks (of
Longmynd, &c.) of very great thickness, and also of doubtful age, but
probably to be linked to the lowest Cambrian groups, and to be placed on
the general parallel of the Skiddaw slates. If so, they will cease to be
Hypozoic, and may then be considered as the lowest known base of the
Cambrian     series.

    The introduction of the May Hill sandstone as a part of the
 Wenlock group is the only change                     I  have made in this portion
 of the ‘Tabular View,’ which is prefixed to the ‘Second Fasciculus
 of the Cambridge Palaeozoic Fossils.”                       It gives a true physical
 and palaeontological base to the Silurian series; and assuredly
there is not (under this arrangement) any such thing in nature
 as a “Middle Silurian Group,” which inseparably links together
the Cambrian and Silurian series, and makes them into one
system.

    In  Devon and Cornwall the above series has no base; and
we are without any good evidence as to the beds below the
lowest Devonian group.                 Hence there is much uncertainty as
to the exact coordination of the series of Herefordshire with that
of Cornwall; for the Herefordshire cornstone has characteristic
fishes without characteristic shells and corals; while the Devon
shire and Cornish series has characteristic shells and corals,
but is without fishes.

The Herefordshire fish-beds (cornstone)          had formerly placed               I
over the   Plymouth     group,  on the    understanding     that certain
supposed fish-beds of Cornwall were probably of the age of the
Dartmouth group.         As, however, the Cornish fish-beds have
disappeared from the sections,                                  I
                                     should think it much the safest
to place the cornstone group at the base of          the groups      De                all                     of

clature is right, because it has the unquestionable right of
priority,+because it is geographically true—and because it is
also palaeontologically   true.   On the contrary, the scheme by
which it has been opposed is an innovation, without being an
improvement derived from progressive evidence.        It has been
vindicated  only  by   a direct desertion of the system  of double
evidence on which the true Silurian groups were firmly esta
blished.   Hence it is geographically untrue, and it is palaeonto
logically erroneous.*.
   So long as geologists believed in the existence of a so-called
“Middle Silurian Group,” there was unquestionably a great
palaeontological difficulty; and there was a show of reason for
affirming that             all
                      the rocks                       of

were      of
           one palaeozoic system, and must therefore have one
name, and might therefore                             be
                                     called “Silurian.”        But we

                 fossils.   But we cannot carry the scheme down
wards, below the May Hill sandstone, without positive desertion                    a
of  our former scheme of evidence.        No wonder that        momen                            a
clature derived from such inconsistency          evidence and change    of
of  principle, should lead        glaring geographical incongruity.

paper be controversial, they are brought forward with no petu
lance, but with a truth-loving spirit, and in a conviction of their
importance. It is impossible that observers should agree during
the investigations of a continually advancing science; and earnest
respectful discussions on unsettled points of nomenclature or
classification of facts, so far from being unfit for the considera-                                                               .

are loosened, not only from the surface of the object, but also                                                 (if

    Now this circumstance, that, in thus proceeding, porosity is
perceptible in entirely fresh organic formations too, immediately
meets the objection which perhaps might be taken—that this
porosity is merely an artificial product, the effect of drying. I
would here however bring to especial remembrance the fact,
that, as experience shows, organic formations by no means lose
their natural texture through mere drying; for dried animal and
vegetable textures, through fresh moistening, reassume their
former appearance and original condition *.
    Very conspicuous are the pores in the roots of plants when
examined after proceeding in the following manner.             Take fresh
roots filled with their juices or after having lain in water,
remove the earth, apply gentle scraping, and then spread out
upon glass for examination, without a covering of glass, the de
tritus adhering to the knife. Then, as the fine scrapings on the
glass dry up and the moisture contained in their interstices
evaporates under the eyes of the observer, the pores in their
substance, with intense illumination, are brought out in so
distinct a manner that the whole scrapings appear composed of
a network of variously twisted and overlapping filaments and
scales, leaflets and granules; and in fact everywhere present a
composition like that of sponge.          The addition of water having
been avoided, there is besides observable in the neighbourhood
of the scrapings some detritus still much finer than the rest, in
which one may very well recognize the disposition of the granular
materials to form minute filaments, and the interstices thereby
arising between them.       It requires however a good light and a
trustworthy microscope to recognize these pores of the roots of
plants; yet a linear enlargement of from 200 to 300 is always
 sufficient, and from the greater clearness tº ereby effected, is
 preferable to higher magnifying powers.

corpuscles are seen slowly revolving, and even performing loco

chloric acid was decomposed.      In these experiments either both
electrodes consisted of platinum, in which case the polarization
Pt(Cl)+Pt(H) had to be subtracted from the original force of the
current, or the positive plate consisted of zinc, and was

was immersed in a solution of sulphate of copper, in which case
the polarization was Pt(Cl).      In the last two cases the force of
a second  battery was introduced into the circle; that     PtCl                is,       H

Consequently, the charges have here been added together; but
the absolute magnitudes of these charges are the same as those
which  I before found for the electromotive forces of chlorine and
hydrogen in a gas battery; for the latter, when reduced to the
present unit, would be 10:10 and 17.89%.

               to               terrestrial magnetism, furnished
                                             of                                                                     its

and with astronomical exactness.          The first conclusions thus
obtained were very important. Amidst many irregularities very

   But thus far the inquiry had been comparatively restricted:
the vastness   the problem required larger field,—the whole

Europe, and still more the portion     over which the magnetic  it
observatories extended,  being very small   compared with the                  as
entire globe. To study the problem adequately,    was necessary                          it

 388             M. A. Secchi             on the Periodical Variations
    One was established at Toronto in Canada, and another at Wan
Diemen’s Island; these two points were chosen as being near to
the two points of maximum magnetic force, and because, being
almost antipodal to each other, they were eminently suited to
show the differences which the opposition of the seasons in the
two hemispheres might introduce in the variations.
   A third observatory was placed at the Cape of Good Hope as
the southern extremity of the African continent, and a point
important for the large amount of secular change taking place in
the magnetic elements.       Lastly, the fourth was established at
St. Helena as a point situated within the tropics, and at a small
distance from the magnetic and geographic equators, as well as
from the line of minimum force.
    The system of observations established at these four places                                 was
 in the highest degree such as science might demand, and as should
 form a true monument to posterity. The instruments were
                                                                                               all

 mentary instruments, with which the magnetic constants might
 be   determined from time             time without touching the large
                                           to
magnets, which experience had shown ought never                            dis        to   be
placed. All these instruments were furnished with mirrors                                        or
 collimators and microscopes, and were observed from                  distance       a

                                    disturb their action.
    The observatories were erected             open situations and without
                                                     in
iron fastenings. All were furnished with proper astronomical
instruments for the exact determination                 time, and with

sphere.     That such a series of observations might be carried on
with due precision, a military service was organized (under the
general direction of Colonel Sabine), in which the observers suc
ceeded each other day and night.            They were taken from the
corps of Artillery, selecting among the most intelligent those
who showed most taste for the work. The staff of each observa
tory consisted of at least four non-commissioned officers and two
soldiers, under the direction of a captain fully instructed in the
duties to be carried on. The series was maintained for several
years; in some cases more, in others less, but nowhere for less
than five years.
    If the quality of the instruments, the system of distribution of
the observatories, and above all the moral character of the nation,
constant and assiduous in carrying through whatever it under
takes, be considered, it will be owned that here was ground for
expecting the manifestation of any discoverable laws, and that
such data deserve full confidence as a basis of serious discussion.
But undigested masses of figures are of small profit to science,
and remain always a useless incumbrance in libraries and archives,
if they are not reduced, ea'amined, and discussed.
    This second part of the work, perhaps not less laborious than
the first, and requiring more ability, was also confided to the
care of Colonel Sabine; and under his direction the numerous
calculations of the reductions have been made, and published in
nine large quarto volumes, at the expense of the British govern
ment, and which have been liberally distributed; the last was
published a few months ago, and more volumes are in course of
 publication.
    Besides the numerical calculations, Colonel Sabine has given,
 in the Introductions to these volumes, graphical representations
 of the variations at each place, and has compared the results
 from the different parts of the world, in order to deduce from
 them the most important conclusions. The whole has been
 executed with surprising sagacity, and at the same time with
 the greatest reserve as to theoretic hypotheses, a thing diffi
 cult in such matters, but strictly requisite where the funda
 mental data of a science have to be fixed.           As this work is the
 most extensive of those hitherto      published   in tabular reductions,
 and the most important in respect of the points of the globe
 occupied, so it will be our principal point of departure in the
 deduction of laws%. We shall not however omit putting under
    * The work of reduction is of the highest importance, and it is necessary
 that it should be executed by those who have made or superintended the
 observations, to avoid the multifarious doubts which arise in its course.
  But in such reductions it is not sufficient to give annual and monthly
  means; it is also necessary to give graphical constructions, which are of

only one which can faithfully and fully illuminate the labyrinth
of magnetic observation. I will briefly notice in what the appa
ratus, which has been working since 1847, consists, and will
describe what was registered in the volume of the Meteorological
Observations of Greenwich for 1847, and which      saw in 1849                             I
through the kindness of Messrs. Airy and Glaisher.
   The magnetic observatory is erected in a garden adjacent to
the astronomical observatory; and the instruments, of which
the march is photographically registered, are the declinometer,
bifilar and balance magnetometers, and, for meteorology, the
barometer, dry- and wet-bulb thermometers,    &c.   To speak
here only of the magnetic instruments, the principle of regis
tration is the following. Each magnetic bar has attached to it
a small mirror, which receives through an aperture the rays
of a gas-light passed through vapour of naphtha, to render                                                     its
photographic action more efficacious.   The mirror reflects these
rays      on
           lens, which concentrates them

                                   have traced of what has been
already done for the study of the variations of terrestrial mag
netism, it will be clear that observations are not wanting; and
what is more, that they have been made systematically and with
extraordinary perseverance, guided by experience, and with unex
ceptionable instruments; whence we may conclude, that if there
were obtained at any place results opposed to the laws deduced
from so imposing a mass of data, amounting to several millions,
they ought to be attributed to faults either in the instruments,
the observations, or the methods of reduction; in short, to some
local or accidental cause; but we shall see that the results are
more accordant than would be believed, and                         it is of   these that
we now proceed to speak.
      PART II.-Principal results obtained from the study of the
                             Magnetic Variations.
  Magnetic variations are of three kinds; the first ordinary
and periodical; the second extraordinary, and apparently irre
gular; and the third requiring for their completion a great and
unknown series of years, and therefore termed secular.       All the
magnetic elements, i.e. the Declination, the Intensity of the Force,
and the Inclination, are subject to these variations. We will
begin with what belongs to the declination and         movements,       its
which fall under some    principal laws, which      will proceed   we                 to
expose.

     First Law.—“The diurnal variations                     of   the magnetic     needle

   Declaration.—The          first discoverers of the diurnal variations               of
the magnetic declination suspected that the needle followed the
           the sun, and therefore the true (or apparent) time

entire circumference of the globe.  In the same manner that
many meteorological   vicissitudes may be simultaneous for such
extents, so may also the magnetic perturbations which might be
produced by them; but as it can rarely happen that meteoro
logical causes occupy the whole surface of the earth, so simul
taneous perturbations produced by them and extending over the
whole globe would be equally rare.
    In fact, if we inspect the magnetic curves, traced in Göttingen
time, for Göttingen and Prague in Europe, and for places situated
in Canada and the United States of America, we shall find that
the places in each continent commonly agree very well with each
other; but that agreement between the continents is seldom
found, although their distance apart is not great compared to
the whole globe.
    It is necessary however to discriminate accurately between two
kinds of periodical variations; those which strictly follow local
time, and those which in their periods occur at the same moment
of absolute time at different stations. We shall speak of the
latter subsequently; but in respect to the former,                                        let   it    be
regarded       asassured that local time              alone considered;

ern limit.” (Toronto Observations, vol. i. p. 14.)   And at Ho
barton as follows:—“The north end of the magnet has two
eastern and two western elongations or turning-points, at both
periods of the year; from October to February the principal
eastern elongation is at 2h, and the minor one at 15h; from
April to August the hours of these turning-points become
respectively 3" and 16"; from October to February the principal
western elongation is between 20% and 21h, and the minor one
at 11"; whilst from April to August the corresponding phae
nomena occur at 22h and 11h.”       Then, comparing the figures
which represent these movements with those of Toronto, he
concludes that they are identical, only having opposite signs,
eacept that the turning-points or periods are earlier at Toronto than
at Hobarton.
   The opposition of these movements is shown in our figure in

   Corollary      III.-A
                       consequence of the                              dependence          on the
magnetic meridian is the advancement or retardation of the
phases with the seasons, as in the course of the year the sun
arrives at the same azimuth from the geographical meridian by
describing a different horary angle, greater in winter and less in
summer; but the discussion of this point will be more suitably
placed in the consideration of the elementary movements of the
needle.
  We will not however omit to notice here one important point.
The needle, in         its
                 nocturnal oscillation, and especially winter,                         in
makes an excursion     which sometimes exceeds the diurnal one.
This has sometimes caused                         be
                                       believed, that the maximum
                                        it   to
of deviation, especially          of
                            western  deviation,  was subject    great                      to
displacement.    But the case      otherwise.
                                            is   The  proper  maxima
of the semi-diurnal excursions always remain         nearly the same       at
hours; but   if  should happen that the nocturnal should exceed
     diurnal,     we it                   say, without qualification,
                                                       to

that the maximum occurs           the evening; the times and the

periods are      todistinguished, and
                      be                    will        all
                                                    clear; for     the     be               if
absolute maximum     may   happen       night,  the relative maxima
                                                  at
however (eliminating the perturbations) follow constantly the
period above enounced; and              these relative maxima and
                                             it   is
minima which constitute the characteristic properties              the                      of
variations    the magnetic

   Remark.-The two laws hitherto enounced are themselves no
other than corollaries            of
                              another more general law, which                                      we
will now   proceed      expose; but

   Third Law.—“The diurnal excursion              the needle  of  the sum             is                :

horary angle, and the second depends besides            the sun's decli    on

upon each other, produce           by

 that the sun should act thus oppositely by his change of
 declination in these two places and not in the others, limiting
itself in these last to only diminishing the fluctuations. It was
added, that the changes at St. Helena and at the Cape not
having reference to the sun’s zenith-distances, his influence
ought to be due to an astronomical rather than to a geographical
and local cause.      It may however naturally be expected that
such a period is marked by the many convolutions and superim
positions of different causes acting on the needle; to extricate it
was not easy, and would have been actually impossible without
the previous labours of Colonel Sabine, which         have happily       I
found sufficient for the purpose.

           L.   On   the   Electricity   of   Flame.        By M. MATTEUccI+.
I
           MY   DEAR GRove,
           HAVE
              gladly taken advantage of a few days’ leisure in the
      country to comply with your request, and at the same time
satisfy my own curiosity, by making some experiments on the
                                     I
electricity of flame, and now send you the little which I have
gathered from my own observations on the subject.           began by           I
studying the conductibility of flame, and employed for this pur
pose a galvanometer constructed by Ruhmkorff, similar to that
of M. du Bois Reymond, the fine copper wire of which makes
24,000 evolutions round a good astatic system. The flame used
in most of my experiments was that of a common spirit-lamp,
or of a double current lamp belonging to the laboratory. The
circuit, which contained two Daniell’s couples, was formed by two
platinum wires, two-thirds of a millimetre in diameter, placed
horizontally, and leaving between them a fixed interval of 8 mil
lims.    All was perfectly insulated, and the flame completed the
circuit. On seeking to ascertain the conducting power of the
different parts of the flame, it is soon found that this conducti
bility increases rapidly in going from the base or root of the
flame towards the summit.       To give an idea of this difference,                   I
mention here that             I
                       had from 4° to 5° of deflection at the base,
8° to 10° at the middle, and from 30° to 40° at the upper part
of the flame. By placing the platinum wires in the flame of a
double current lamp, much more striking effects are obtained,
which are evidently in proportion with the temperature of the
gas composing the flame.        If we hold the platinum wires at a
less interval apart, that     from   is,   millims., over the flame

which you obtained from the flame of alcohol or of hydrogen is
of the same nature as that which is obtained if the two platinum
wires are placed in water after having been in contact, or while
in contact, the one with hydrogen, the other with oxygen gas:
the current in the former case is feebler, owing to the bad con
ducting power of flame.     We should thus be led to suppose,
1st, that the action between the platinum and the gases takes
place even at a very high temperature, which supposition is in
accordance with experiment; 2nd, that vapour, like water in a
liquid state, is decomposed by the electrical current, which
remains to be proved.

       GENTLEMEN,
    In communicating the above interesting experiments,               am               I
tempted to add a few words of comment; for though                  do not         I
differ much from the interpretation of the flame-current given
by my friend M. Matteucci, it interests me in a different point
of view. This I can best explain by stating a conviction I very
early acquired from the chemical theory of Voltaism, and which
has led to many of the experimental results that               have from I
time to time communicated to the Philosophical Magazine.               It
is,  that  every chemical  synthetic  action   may,             by

above in the absence of an electrolyte; but M. Matteucci seems,
if I rightly read his letter, to regard the steam in the flame as
having an electrolytic action, being, in fact, the substitute                                                  for

           ON SOME    NEW DERIVATIVES OF CHLOROFORM.
                        BY PROF. WILLIAMSON.
       CCORDING to the results of recent   researches in the constitution
      of salts and the methods thence introduced of explaining chemical
reactions, it is equally correct to represent such a reaction as that of
hydrochloric acid on hydrate of potash, as consisting in an exchange
of hydrogen of the one for potassium of the other, or of chlorine in
one for peroxide of hydrogen in the other.      In Mr. Kay's researches
as described in the following brief outline, this notion has obtained
very striking illustration; for he has obtained a peculiar body in
which the chlorine of chloroform is replaced by peroxide of aethyle
by the action of chloroform on three atoms of aethylate of sodium,
which product may be equally well conceived to be a body in which
the hydrogen of three atoms of alcohol is replaced by the tribasic
radical of chloroform.
   According to the older theories of the capacity of saturation of
salts, this compound would contain a tribasic modification of formic
acid, for it has the same relation to formic aether as a so-called tri
                                                            -
basic phosphate has to a monobasic one.
    To one equivalent of chloroform were added, by degrees, three
equivalents of dry and powdered aethylate of soda, a violent action
                                                                       º
taking place with the evolution of much heat; the liquid was entirely
distilled from the residue (chloride of sodium) by means of an oil
bath, and then subjected to a series of fractional distillations, which
yielded a small distillate between 50° and 60°C., smelling strongl
of vinous aether, a large distillate (about three-fourths of the
between 77° and 78°C., which was chiefly alcohol, and another small
distillate (about one-sixth) between 145° and 145°-3 C.
     The distillates obtained by the above process, except that of alcohol,
being small, the following modification was adopted.
     Sodium was dissolved in absolute alcohol until the action became
 feeble, chloroform was then added, care being taken to keep the
 liquid alkaline; more sodium was then added, and the process re
 peated several times, until the chloride of sodium precipitated be
 came very bulky. The liquid was then distilled off and chloroform
 added to the residue, and also distilled off.     To this first distillate
 sodium was again added, and treated with the last distillate instead
 of pure chloroform, the same precautions being used as before. This
 method gave similar distillates, and in about the same proportion as
 that first used; the highest distillate however boiled constantly at
  146° instead of at 145°-3 C.
     This compound which boils at 145° to 146°C. is a colourless
 limpid liquid, only slightly soluble in water, having a strongly aro
  matic odour, readily inflammable and burning without much smoke;
 its   specific gravity
                      is  '8964;   itremained liquid    0°F.
                                                         at
      Several   analyses made of  this body agree    giving
                                                    in           tothe for
                                                                  it

  tribasic formic-aether; the density   its be
                                             vapour also corresponds very
  closely with the same formula.

   Pentachloride of phosphorus added to a portion of the compound
produced a heavy liquid having the odour of chloroform.
   A small quantity of the body was dissolved in alcohol, distilled
upwards for two or three hours with solid hydrate of potash and
then distilled off; the residue was next dissolved in water and made
exactly neutral by hydrochloric acid, filtered to remove the turbidity,
and then a few drops of chloride of mercury added; after a little time
and by the application of heat, a very slight precipitate of subchlo
ride of mercury was formed; also the colour of sesquichloride of
iron was a little darkened by another portion of the solution, thus
showing that the action of potash on the compound had produced
formic acid, but in very small quantity.
   An equivalent of dry hydrochloric acid was passed into a portion
of the compound; the gas was wholly absorbed, a considerable amount
of heat being evolved and the liquid assuming a brownish colour; the
liquid after the absorption of the gas still remained perfectly neutral.
It was next distilled with the thermometer: it began to boil at 20°C.
and rose gradually to 100°; it was collected in three portions, the first
(about one-sixth of the whole) passing over between 20° and 50°, the
second (about one-third) between 50° and 68°, the third (one-half)
between 68° and 100°.        I was unable to carry these distillations
further in consequence of the small quantity of the liquid available.
   Two equivalents of dry hydrochloric acid were passed into a
larger quantity of the compound; towards the close the gas was
absorbed less freely, a portion passing through; after this treatment,
the liquid fumed and was highly acid; it was distilled upwards for
some time, by which a portion of free hydrochloric acid was expelled,
and then distilled fractionally; about one-third came over between
56° and 60°C., one-fourth between 60° and 70°, one-sixth between
70° and 80°, and the remainder (about one-fourth) between 80° and
88°. To the lowest distillate about an equal bulk of water was
added; the substance floated on the surface and seemed to be little,
if at all  dissolved          by
                           the water;      sufficient quantity
                                            a                       carbonate  of
of soda was next added            neutralize the free acid, and the liquid
pipetted from the water,           it to
                                 was then distilled upwards for some time
with   dry  chloride     calcium,
                             of    and afterwards distilled off; this distil
late was found         boil
                         to  constantly     55°5at       An analysis made
                                                             C.                            of
this  body   agrees  closely  with the formula C6H14 O”.
   The distillate which came over between 60° and 70° after being
treated  in  the same way        the lower distillate, also yielded
                                    as                                  liquid      a
which boiled at 56°C.

                                                                          of

         LII.       On the Mechanical Energies of the Solar System.
                       By Professor WILLIAM THoMson +.
 Tº      mutual actions and motions of the heavenly bodies have
     long been regarded as the grandest phaenomena of mechanical
 energy in nature. But their light has been seen, and their heat
 has been felt, without the slightest suspicion that we had thus a
 direct perception of mechanical energy at all. Even after it has
 been shownt that the almost inconceivably minute fraction of
 the sun’s heat and light reaching the earth is the source of
energy from which                     all
                           the mechanical actions      organic life,               of
and   nearly every motion       inorganic natureof      surface, are          at    its
derived, the energy       this source has been scarcely thought

 at any instant such as to correspond to elliptical or circular orbits
 round the sun, the effects of the resisting medium would gradually
 bring them in to strike his surface. Also, it is easy to prove
 dynamically that meteors falling in to the sun, whatever may
 have been their previous state of motion, must enter his atmo
 sphere, or strike his surface, with, on the whole, immensely
 greater relative velocities than those with which meteors falling
 to the earth enter the earth’s atmosphere, or strike the earth's
 surface.    Now, Joule has shown what enormous quantities of
 heat must be generated from this relative motion in the case of
 meteors coming to the earth; and by his explanation* of “fall

    The amount of matter, drawn by the sun in any time from
 surrounding space, would be such as in 47# years to amount to
 a mass equal to that of the earth.       Now there is no reason what
 ever to suppose that 100 times the earth’s mass drawn in to
 the sun, would be missed from the zodiacal light (or from meteors
 revolving inside the orbit of Mercury, whether visible as the
 “zodiacal light” or not); and we may conclude that there is no
 difficulty whatever in accounting for a constancy of solar heat
 during 5000 years of time past or to come.              Even physical
 astronomy can raise no objection by showing that the sun’s mass
 has not experienced such an augmentation; for according to the
 form of the gravitation theory which              I
                                             have proposed, the added
 matter is drawn from a space where it acts on the planets with
 very nearly the same forces as when incorporated in the sun.
 This form of the gravitation theory then, which may be proved
 to require a greater mass of meteoric matter to produce the solar
 heat than would be required on any other assumption that could
 be made regarding the previous positions and motions of the
 meteors, requires not more than it is perfectly possible does fall
 in to the sun. Hence I think we may regard the adequacy of
 the meteoric theory to be fully established.
    Let us now consider how much chemical action would be re
 quired to produce the same effects, with a view both to test the
 adequacy of the theory that the sun is merely a burning mass
 without a supply of either fuel or dynamical energy from without,
 and to ascertain the extent to which, in the third theory, the
 combustion of meteors may contribute, along with their dynamical
 energies, to the supply of solar heat.            Taking the former
 estimate, 2781 thermal units Centigrade, or 3,869,000 foot-lbs.
 as the rate per second of emission of energy from a square foot
 of the sun’s surface, equivalent to 7000 horse-power, we find

units, and of a pound of potassium in chlorine 2655; a pound
of potassium in oxygen 1700 according to Joule; and carbon in
oxygen, according to various observers, 8000. The greatest of
these numbers, multiplied by 1890 to reduce to foot-pounds,
expresses only the 6000dth part, according to Mr. Waterston’s
theory, and, according to the form of the gravitation theory
now proposed, only the 3000dth part, of the least amount of
dynamical energy a meteor can have on entering the region of
ignition in the sun’s atmosphere.        Hence a mass of carbon

strike the sun with the velocity due to half the potential energy
of gravitation lost in coming in from an infinite distance to his
surface.   The other half of this energy goes to generate heat
very slowly and diffusely in the resisting medium.       Many a
meteor, however, we cannot doubt, comes in to the sun at once
in the   course of a rectilineal or hyperbolic path, without having
spent any appreciable energy in the resisting medium; and,
consequently, enters the region of ignition at his surface with a
velocity due to the descent from              previous state  its  motion                       of              or

   Meteors which when at great distances possessed, relatively to
the centre of gravity of the solar system, velocities not incom
parably smaller than the velocity due to gravitation to the sun’s
surface, must strike the surfaces of the earth and of the other
planets not incomparably less frequently than equal areas of the
sun's surface, and with not incomparably smaller velocities, and
consequently must generate heat at the surfaces of the earth and
other planets not incomparably less copiously than at equal areas
                            º
of the sun's surface.    But the whole heat emitted from any part
of the sun's surface is incomparably greater than       that   gene                   all             is

therefore    incomparably greater than

Chººs            who have been in the habit of using Wollaston's
        goniometer are aware of the trouble and sometimes diffi
culty of making each face of the crystal so reflect the black lines,
that, on moving the instrument until both approximate, they shall
be truly parallel, and at length, as the movement is continued,
perfectly coincide.
   Most operators find it difficult, in moving the crystal with the
fingers on the wax, to prevent disturbing the first adjustment
while making the second. With some crystals this is compara
tively easy, with others great loss of time is occasioned by                                                  it.
The fact          is,
             that the movements        the fingers are too coarse, and

   Principle I.-Probability is always relative to our actual state
of information.   Upon the actual connexions of events it depends
 no further than as such connexions are known to us.
     This doctrine of the nature of probability, it may be added,
 has been fully recognized by acute and thoughtful minds ap
 proaching the subject from a point of view different from the
 mathematical one”.
     I  proceed to the statement of an important principle founded
 on the nature of language as an instrument of expression.                        It
 is,               theory       probabilities,

   These results (4) and (5) are both given by the development
(Laws of Thought, p. 322). The probabilities (3), together with
the relation (4), are equivalent to the data of the problem as
expressed in terms of a, y, and 2 in the section referred to.
Now I remark that the mere probabilities (3) do not of them
selves furnish any relations connecting w, y, s and t.         The whole
of the relation connecting those elements is given by (4), and it
is given in the form of a logical equation, i.e. of an equation
interpretable into a proposition. We possess of that relation an
eaplicit and available knowledge.       But it is not so with the rela
tion connecting the elements w, y, z, when, as in the primary
statement of the problem, these are assumed as simple events.
We are explicitly informed that these elements are connected by
the relation 2(1–4)(1—y)=0; but beside this, they are con
nected with each other in a complex manner through the data
   Prob. a =                cl,

These data exhibit both      and        connected with
                                                  a        y and thereby
                                                                as                                2,
also connected with each other.       But that connexion         not                                    is            of

 what the same expressions logical become when we change, as

probabilities (Principle I.).
  Probabilities before the nexus:—
       V   (quantitative) = probability of the drawing of a ball                                       not of
             the species D.
       V.(quantitative) = probability of the drawing of a ball                                         of the
             species s but not of the species D.
       V.(quantitative) = probability of the drawing of a ball                                         of the
             species t but not of the species D.
       A  (quantitative) = probability of the drawing of a ball                                        of the
            species   A.
       Now, after the
                    newus, the probability of the drawing of a ball
of the species s is obviously the same as the probability before
the nexus,  that if a ball not of the species D be drawn, it will be
of the species s. Hence

442                       Prof. Boole on a General Method in
the ratios s, t, &c. being found from (9), must be substituted in
(10). These ratios being positive fractions, we must employ a
set of values of s, t, &c., which consists solely of positive frac
tions.   It will hereafter be shown, that when the problem is a
real one,  the system (9) furnishes one, and only one set of values
answering the required description: that set must therefore be
taken. This is the only addition required to the general rule as
given in the Laws of Thought.
   The combined systems (9) and (10) may be elegantly deduced
by the following method, originally communicated to me by
Professor Donkin.
   The probabilities, before the nexus, of the events V, W, Wº..
and A are the corresponding quantitative functions V,         W, ..                                       V,
and A. The probabilities of the same events after the nexus are
1, p, q      ...
           and    respectively.  Now the only effect     the nexus                                  of
                        a u

           the above events, without affecting the cases favourable
 totheir happening.   Hence the several probabilities have      each                                       to
                                                                           :p as

September,  October, and November 1845, and for the period
consisting of these four months.     The ratios for the several
months in the fourth column of this table show a much less
extent of deviation from the mean ratio of one to one and a
quarter than those for shorter periods; and in them also is evi
dent a tendency to increase on the approach of winter.
  11. It is a question of some interest whether the excess         of the
rain-fall at the  gauge   G above that at the    gauge  H is principally
caused by the greater elevation of the ground at the former
gauge, or by the greater proximity of the gauge G to the chain
of summits of the mountain range.
   In order to throw some light on this question, there are added
in the fifth column of Table          the depths II. rain,    published        of          to,as

       concerning the phaenomena attending the fall of meteorites
and fire-balls, &c., or give a list of the analyses which have from
time to time been made of various meteoric irons and stones.
Sufficeit to say, that no new chemical element has yet been dis
covered in these bodies, though several new mineral compounds
have been observed. Most, indeed nearly all, the simple chemical
elements have been detected in them.
  Some consist of pure iron; others of iron alloyed with nickel,
perhaps also accompanied with small quantities of carbon, chro
mium, cobalt, arsenic and phosphorus; and some few are me
chanically combined with crystallized olivine; the majority have,
however, a common or normal character, both internally and
externally.  They have been variously classified; as by Prof.
Shepard in the following way, treating them as it were minera

  meteoric irons and stones; a theory principally supported by the
  chemists and electricians, as Sir H. Davy, Fusinieri, M. Biot,
  Prof. Shepard, M. F. G. Fischer and others. Before concluding
  this paper I shall shortly allude to this theory, as it bears
   strongly on the general subject. I cannot do better than again
  quote from Prof. Shepard.       (See his Report on American Me
   teorites, published in the American Journal of Science.)
      “The extra-terrestrial origin of meteoric stones and iron
  masses seems likely to be more and more called in question, with
  the advance of knowledge respecting such substances, and as
  additions continue to be made to the connected sciences; I may
  therefore take an early occasion of presenting some views,
  founded partly upon Biot’s theory of the aurora borealis, which
  seem to favour such an origin of meteorites.
      “The recent study of those frequently occurring and wide
  spread atmospheric accumulations of meteoric dust (a single case
  being recorded where the area must have been thousands of
  square miles in extent, and where the quantity of earthy matter
  precipitated must have been from 50 to 500,000 tons in weight),
  makes known to us the vast scale on which terrestrial matter is
  often pervading the regions of the upper atmosphere, and pre
  pares us to appreciate the mode in which peculiar constituents
  of meteorites may be translated to those remote distances, where,
  according to the theory of Biot, the clouds of meteoric dust are
  retained.                                           -
      “Great electrical excitation is known to accompany volcanic
  eruptions, which may reasonably be supposed to occasion some
  chemical changes in the volcanic ashes ejected; these being
 wafted by the ascensional force of the eruption into the regions
 of the magneto-polar influence, may there undergo a species of
 magnetic analysis. The most highly magnetic elements (iron,
 nickel, cobalt, chromium, &c.), or compounds in which these
 predominate, would thereby be separated and become suspended
 in the form of metallic dust, forming those columnar clouds so
 often illuminated in auroral displays, and whose position con
 forms to the direction of the dipping-needle.      While certain of
 the    diamagnetic   elements (or combinations of them), on the
 other    hand, may  under the control of the same force be collected
 into different masses, taking up a position at right angles to
 the former (which Faraday has shown to be the fact in respect
 to such bodies), and thus produce those more or less regular
 arches, transverse to the magnetic meridian, that are often re
cognized in the phaenomena of the aurora borealis.
     “Any great disturbance of the forces maintaining these clouds
of meteor-dust, like that produced by a magnetic storm, might
lead to the precipitation of portions of the matter thus suspended,

    considered Geographically, Statistically, and Cosmically.                                                    451
If the disturbance was confined to the magnetic dust, iron-masses
would fall; if to the diamagnetic dust, a non-ferruginous stone;
if it should extend to both classes simultaneously, a blending of
the two characters would ensue in the precipitate, and a rain of
ordinary meteoric stones would take place.
    “As favouring this view, we are struck with the rounded,
hailstone-like form of many of the particles of composition (even
though consisting of widely different substances) in nearly                                                           all
stones, and even         many    in
                                  the iron masses. ofNor are these
shapes         to    be
                referred     fusion;  they evidently
                                          to         depend  upon                                                      a
cause  analogous               to
                      that which determines the same   configuration
in  hailstones themselves.

but there is no recorded or historic instance of a stone fall; yet in
the United States there have been seventeen falls of stones this

        SIR,
   The experiments on electro-dynamic induction in liquids which
you have published in a letter to M. de la Rive, have excited
our lively interest, not only because the phaenomenon appeared
to us to be of importance in itself, but especially because it
seemed likely to throw some light upon the manner in which
                                                             -
electricity is propagated in liquids.
   Do liquids conduct exclusively by electrolysis, or do they also
possess a proper conductibility, similar to that of metals       An
experiment that we have made may perhaps assist in the solution
of this question. It is well known that the conductibility of
liquids increases with their temperature, whilst the opposite
effect takes place with the metals, a fact which is easily explained
if we suppose that liquids, in general oppose less resistance to
decomposition in proportion as their temperature is raised.                                         If
this explanation be the true one, the next thing to be ascertained
is, whether liquid will also exhibit this increase
                   a                                  conductibility            of
for    acurrent        so
                     weak               as
                                 traverse    without
                                                 to  producing   any
                                                                 it
apparent chemical decomposition.      this were the case, would
                                                            If                               it
appear probable that the decomposition nevertheless took place,
and that      was
               it           by    its
                           intervention that the current passed
through the liquid. We have endeavoured           solve this question     to
by the following experiment.      We passed the current         small                       of
                                                                                             a
Daniell’s element through      column    a                      of
                                          distilled water 24 centi
metres      length, contained
           in in
                                     glass tube   in  about
                                                       a        milli          of            15
metres     diameter;  the electrodes were   platinum wire. One       of                             of
these electrodes was connected with the zinc pole     the battery,the          of
other with one end          of    the helix            of   a   galvanometer           of   which the

466                      MM. Van Breda                  and Logeman on the
wire made 1800 coils, the other end of which communicated with
the copper pole. The tube was immersed in a water-bath, the
temperature of which could be raised by means of a spirit-lamp.
When the water was at 59°F., the needle of the galvanometer
deviated 4°.   When the lamp was lighted, this deviation was
seen to increase regularly.   At a temperature of 152°6 F., the
deviation was   7°,  and at 190°4 F. it was 11°. The increase
of the conductibility of the liquid by heat was therefore proved,
even when traversed by an excessively feeble current.   Had any
chemical decomposition  of the water taken place     during this
experiment    Its direct result led to the belief that such was
the   case,but we were also fortified in this opinion by the follow
ing circumstances.    When the liquid was cooled, the communi
cations remaining untouched, the needle of the galvanometer no
longer showed any appreciable deviation.       When the direction
of the current in the column of water was reversed, the needle
immediately deviated 8° and returned insensibly, but in a short
time to 4°, at which point it remained stationary.      It was con
sequently an effect of the polarization of the electrodes that we
observed in this case, a polarization which opposed the current
at the first moment of                      its
                            passing, without, however, being able
                by it,
to annul             but which annulled  completely whenit  had become                it
stronger             the passage     the stronger
                                              of   current through the
heated      liquid.
     But     this polarization the peculiar effect, and consequently
            is
the   irrefragable proof,                   of
                              chemical action       There are many          ?
experiments which render this opinion,        not absolutely certain, if
at  least  exceedingly  probable.    We  may   mention      particular                  in
those       Schönbein,
           of            who found that the effect continues when
the electrodes which have served         introduce              to
                                                       current into              a                              a

has been passed, and also that effects exactly similar          those                                          of

               Conductibility of Liquids for Electricity.         467
dynamic induction in liquids might furnish a means of submitting
this opinion to an experimental test, by trying whether the
electrodes, employed in that experiment to conduct the instan
taneous current of the fluid helix to the galvanometer, are or
are not polarized by this current.      To obtain a decisive effect it
was necessary to reproduce the phaenomenon with more intensity
than when, as in your experiments, the question was merely to
prove the phaenomenon itself.        For this purpose we made use
of a  tube of vulcanized Indian rubber, of about 1 centimetre in
internal diameter and 13 metres in length. We twisted it round
the two branches of the large electro-magnet intended for experi
ments in diamagnetism, which, if we are not mistaken, has the
same form and the same dimensions as your own; it is covered
by a coil of copper wire 3 millimetres in diameter and 180 metres
long. The tube was entirely filled with a mixture of 6 parts by
volume of water and 1 part of sulphuric acid.       It was terminated
at both ends     by glass  tubes of about 4 centimetres in length;
into each of these     passed  a platinum wire of 1 millimetre in
diameter, the portion of which immersed in the liquid was about
2.5 centimetres in length. All being thus arranged, the ends
of the two platinum wires were connected with the galvanometer
of 1800 coils which was placed at a distance of 10 metres. We
had ascertained previously that at this distance the magnet did
not exercise any sensible action upon the needles.       The moment
the two ends of the copper-wire coil of the electro-magnet were
put in connexion with the poles of a Grove’s battery of 60 large
elements, arranged in a double series of 30, the needle of the
galvanometer deviated suddenly about 40°, and returned, after
oscillations which occupied between 1 and 2 minutes, to 0°.
 When the circuit of the pile was interrupted, the galvanometer
deviated again about the same number of degrees, but in the
opposite direction, returning again to 0° in the same manner.
The needle returning in both cases to 0°, one would be tempted,
at first sight, to think that there was no polarization of the elec
trodes.    But the strong impulsion communicated to the very
astatic system of the galvanometer        by the induced current,
causing the needles to oscillate during a considerable period
as we have just stated, the circuit remaining always complete, it
appeared possible that the polarization, if it existed, had already
exhausted itself before the needles had arrived at a state of repose.
To get rid of this difficulty we put the two electrodes in direct
communication with each other by means of a copper wire of
only 10 centimetres in length, although they still remained in
connexion with the galvanometer.         The induced current pro
duced when the circuit of the      pile was established, then passed
by this wire rather than by the infinitely longer wire of the

galvanometer, and the needles remained    rest.  But when this                             at
wire was removed after the establishment of the communication
with the pile, we saw the galvanometer deviate instantly                                                                        in   an
opposite direction   the deviation produced to the induced current                              by

10°.    By replacing the wire, then interrupting the circuit and
again removing the wire, we saw the galvanometer deviate         the                                                            in
contrary direction, and rest,     the same manner,    about 10°    in                                        at                      on
the other side     the divided arc. of     both cases the deviation               In

not communicate directly with the ground, and the communica
tion with the galvanometer had been established, the needle
deviated from 3° to 4° in one direction, and the same distance in
the opposite direction when the current of the spark was passed
through the water the other way. This deviation could be brought
to 15° or more by throwing several sparks instead of one upon
one of the plates, or by connecting the plate for a very short
time with the conductor of the machine during the movement
of its plate.

first a north wind, but the further north the place from whence
this north wind comes the more will it change into a N.E. wind,
 as the velocity of rotation of the earth is less in the higher than
in the lower latitudes; therefore the wind that left Edinburgh
as a N. wind reaches London, we will say, as a N.N.E. wind;
if it left the latitude of Shetland as a N. wind, it reaches London
as a N.E. wind; and if it left the polar circle as a N. wind, it
reaches London as an E.N.E. wind.           It is plain that in these
cases we have only to do with one unaltered current, which, the
further it proceeds, the more                         its
                                     original direction appears de

coldest and driest.

476               Prof. Sedgwick on the May Hill Sandstone,
probably filled with Wenlock shale, and near the latter place
some large protruding bosses of igneous rock have elevated a
fine mass of limestone, which dips in a north-westerly direction
towards the valley. On the opposite side of the valley, and about
two miles from Presteign, rises another and a similar mass of
limestone, dipping also towards the valley, in a south-easterly
direction and at a great angle.    From beneath this second mass
of limestone rise some thin beds of arenaceous and calcareous
shale, succeeded by beds of yellowish sandstone of considerable
thickness, which are thrown into a saddle, and form a pictu
resque ridge.    Near the summit of the ridge the sandstone be
comes more    coarse, and passes into a conglomerate very like that
near the   top of the well-known beds of May Hill. As we de
scend from the ridge towards Presteign the dip becomes reversed,
and we again meet with the limestone, which (though broken
and interrupted) seems to have wrapped round the protruding
ridge, so as to dip, wherever it appears, from the sandstone.
  If the shale of the valleybe Wenlock shale, the limestone must
be in the place of the limestone of Woolhope; and         fossils are             its
unquestionably those      the Wenlock group.

   1. Immediately on the west side of the Silurian hills is the
rugged trappean ridge which forms the base of the section.
Some parts of it are highly cellular and amygdaloidal; and if it
were originally submarine,   it must have been formed at least in
                                                               -
a  very shallow sea.
    2. Next follows a remarkable series of beds, which towards
the north become greatly expanded, and which on the sectional
line are of considerable thickness. They are made up of a kind
of trappean breccia, and of a fine granular recomposed trap, in
some places forming a good building-stone.     And these masses
alternate with some beds (especially in the more northern parts
of the range) to which the name ash might, I think, be fairly
given—though I greatly limit the meaning of the word ash, as
used in the Government Survey. In                            its

     The beds (in a quarry under Pen Cerrig House) which are

  Orthoceras (?); and we found in them no other fossil.

   From the above statements the following conclusions seem
naturally to follow:—
   1st. The Pentamerus beds (or Norbury limestone, No.4) must
be arranged with the shales (No. 5. fig. 2), as their fossils belong
to a group which is entirely distinct from that of the Builth flag.
The case is exactly like that at Norbury and in the neighbour
hood of Wenlock, where the same beds were cut off from the
Caradoc sandstone, and arranged by Professor M'Coy and myself
as the base of the upper or true Silurian series.      Here (just as
in Bohemia) there                 is,
                        after the intervention         bed      trap,         of    a         of

                                      is in
rian, while the lower    Cambrian: and similar remark applies,     a

    Of what date then are the Dol Fan conglomerates and the
 associated beds        grit and slate? The answer can only

 plied     by
           the fossils.        my old collection,
                                         In       made   1846,   have                 in          I
 but one species from the neighbourhood           Dol Fan, viz. Euom    of
 phalus tricinctus.
    During the year 1846           made, however, another traverse
                                              I

                 and the Palaeozoic System    of England.               481
through the conglomerates, which are finely exhibited between
Llandovery and Pumsant; and at Bwlch Trebennau                  I found the
following fossils, which were determined by Mr. Salter:—
Encrinite     stems (abundant).         Orthis elegantula (abundant).
Favosites andother ill-preserved        Atrypa crassa.
    corals.                             Calymene, small fragment not
Turbinolopsis (a large species).          specifically determinable.
Leptana sericea (abundant).
    The parcel containing this list never reached the Cambridge
Museum, and Bwlch Trebennau does not, therefore, appear in
M'Coy's alphabetical list of “Lower Palaeozoic Localities*.” But
I  lately revisited the same spot, along with him; and we pro
cured from it the two following species, Euomphalus tricinctus
and E. triporcatus.        Both species are true Cambrian types; and
the former helps us to connect the conglomerates of Trebennau
with those of Dol Fan. Taken collectively, the above list, how
ever imperfect, seems clearly to indicate a group below the May
Hill sandstone, and is therefore Cambrian.
    IV.    Intimately associated with the above conglomerates, and,
I  believe,    on a lower geological stage, is a very great develop
ment of rather earthy slates, and of arenaceous flagstones, some
times coarse, and almost deserving the name of conglomerates,
in which case they are often ferruginous. The shaly slates of
this group are well seen in the high hills which form the water
shed between Builth and Llandovery, both on the old road and
on the newer road by Llanwrtyd and the Sugarloaf.                      Beds
of the same      general age  range  far  up  the hills on both sides of
the Towy above Llangadoc, and here and there show somewhat
rugged crests of hard, brown sandstone or conglomerate.
    This group is in some places extremely fossiliferous, and may
be well seen in an excursion northward from Llandeilo to Taliaris,
 and round the hills near Garn Fawr. This excursion was made
by Mr. Salter and myself in 1846, and we obtained fossils from
the following localities, viz. below Taliaris, Park Lodge, Garn
 Fawr, Cil-y-waun, and other places on our track.             I  have in my
 note-book the lists made out by Mr. Salter, with which I will
 not trouble the reader, as the fossils may be far better studied
 in the Museum of Practical Geology than in the Cambridge col
 lection.      But this  I  may state, on the authority of Professor
 M'Coy, that so far as my lists and species go, they form a very
 characteristic upper Bala group, and contain not so much as one
 species which can be regarded as characteristic of a May Hill or
 a Wenlock group.
    *  At the same time was lost a small but valuable parcel, containing the
 fossils from the neighbourhood of Devil's Bridge.

482          Prof. Sedgwick on     the   May Hill Sandstone,
   The above great and ill-defined group seems to range through
the water-shed last mentioned, and so to pass under the Wen
lock escarpment.    On the southern side of the valley between
Llandovery and Llangadoc the same group is exposed, and from
various quarries (e.g. Pen-y-lan, Goleugod, Cefn Rhyddan)                  I
obtained the species described by Professor M'Coy in his List of
the Cambridge Palaeozoic Fossils.     As among them were some
species which rather seemed to indicate a May Hill group, it
became important to re-examine some of the localities, which               I
will notice in the order in which we visited them.
   1st. Penlan (or Pen-y-lan), a little more than a mile E.S.E.
of Llandovery.
   The quarry with the fossils is near the crest of the hill, and
contains some beds of sandstone, alternating with a decomposing
flagstone and indurated shale. It was formerly used for building,
but is now deserted.    The beds dip at a great angle about N.W.
Some of the beds of the ridge, which ranges to the N.E., are
nearly perpendicular.    In a new quarry, nearly a mile towards
the N.E., and at a lower level, we found the beds dipping about
S.E. at an angle of 70°. We believe it almost impossible to
determine, by the evidence of sections, what exact relation the
Penlan beds bear to the rocks in the immediate neighbourhood;
but among the ruins of the deserted quarry we collected the
following species:—
      Halysites catenulatus.              Stenopora fibrosa.
      Petraia uniserialis.                Pentamerus globosus.
            bina.              -
                                                oblongus (very      abun
      Palaeopora megastoma.                        dant).
   This list does not contain any species which has hitherto been
regarded as exclusively characteristic of Cambrian rocks, and it
gives us a true and characteristic May Hill group of fossils.

its north side, and third quarry

             abundance).                                        Leptana sericea.
                     testudinaria.                                        quinquecostata.
                                                                          -
                    jlabellulum.
  This is a very characteristic Cambrian group, containing only
two species, which are common to the May Hill beds.
  The third quarry we had not time to examine in detail, but it
contained Leptaena sericea abundantly (a good Cambrian species,
never found by us in the May Hill or Wenlock groups).
  Here (as in the former case) we are not able to define the place
of the Goleugod ridge by help of the sections.      The country is
broken and faulted, and      the beds are highly inclined; but

   Two of the above (E. punctatus and O. testudinaria) are some
times found in Silurian rocks, the others are exclusively Cambrian.
   2nd. North side of the hill, from an old quarry, and thence
down to the level of the river.
           Stenopora fibrosa.                        Pentamerus      oblongus (abundant).
           Petraia uniserialis.                               linguiferus (including
           Spirigerina reticularis.                           wndatus).
           Leptagonia depressa.                      Turritella cancellata (?).
   Here we have not one exclusively Cambrian species, but several
which are common to Cambrian and Silurian rocks.           Ilike that
of Penlan, it is a good May Hill fossil group.
   Such were the results of a single day’s examination of the very
broken and difficult country to the south of Llandovery.            It
would, perhaps, have been impossible to arrange          beds     any                   its           in
approximate geological order had there been         clearer evidence          no
in  any other typical country.      There   are,  however,        this                                in
country two very distinct fossil groups,      May Hill group, and    a
 an upper Bala     Cambrian group. These two groups are
                          or                                                                                  in

490               Prof. Sedgwick on the May Hill Sandstone,
lists published in the “Silurian System,” and in the descriptive
lists of the Cambridge Palaeozoic fossils by M'Coy.     We added,
 during our late hasty visit, only one new species, and it would
be idle for me to give many extracts from my note-book; but                                         I
 will make one exception in favour of the quarries of Bird’s Hill
 near Llandeilo, where there are several beds of limestone which
 dip N.W., and are on the northern side of the              saddle.
    In those quarries are three or four bands of limestone marked
                                                                         1.

 portions are more like the Coniston limestone and       associated            its
 calcareous slates, than any other portions   the Llandeilo group  of
in  the neighbourhood.     From these beds we obtained the follow
 ing species:—                      -

                          the facts above described,      can now affirm,I
 on fuller evidence than was given           my preceding paper (which
                                                    in

 classification, and consequently of nomenclature, given in the
 Tabular View (supra, p. 362) is true for the whole Cambrian
 series, L-that it is the only approach to a good analysis of this
 series which has yet been given—that it was worked out correctly
 by my own labours among the older rocks of Wales, and has the
 claim of priority—that it is geographically appropriate; that
it is physically true, because it makes a break between the Cam
 brian and the overlying Silurian series where mature herself had
 made it—and lastly, that it is palaeontologically             true, inasmuch
 as that break is followed by an immediate and great change of
the fossil species.       It is true, exactly for the same reason that
 Smith's    original   classification and nomenclature (however un
couth and harsh sounding) of the Oolitic series was true—because
founded on true sections backed by lists of fossils.                  It is true,
for the same reason that Mr. Prestwich’s            analysis    of the deposits
above our chalk is true.          Lastly, it is true, for the same reason
that the classification and nomenclature of the “Upper Silurian *
rocks is true, Nor is there, in the past history of British geology,
any example of a single group, or series of groups, which has
stood   its ground and been established, except                 principles like
                                                                   on

    When the progress of information proved that the Caradoc
group had in many places been misinterpreted, and that the
Llandeilo group had been placed at the base of the “System ’’
by a great misconception of the Llandeilo section, one might
have looked for some modification of the nomenclature.          On the
long run it would have been wise for the Author of the “System ’’
to have changed his nomenclature: but for present advocacy it
 would have been unwise; for those who have accepted and used

sections; were              its
                     subdivisions natural,            names geographically  its

each speaker absolutely evaded the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th questions, and
left the obvious inference drawn from my own affirmative answers
untouched. Whether this was done out of forbearance towards
myself I must leave the reader to judge.                As a matter of fact
my questions were evaded, and both the facts and inferences of
my paper remained absolutely untouched.                                        -
    One of the leading members of the Government Survey affirmed
that I had only raised a question of words—a question already
settled.     I reply that, between us, it is not a question of words
but of   facts, and of the classification of certain natural groups.
If  my interpretation of the sections of Castell Craig Gwyddon,
of the great group between Dol Fan and Garn Fawr, and of cer
tain groups south of Llandovery be right, the Government Sur
veyors have misinterpreted them.                                   If
                                                    they have understood
them, I have blundered in their interpretation. There is a plain
question of fact between us; and till it is settled the discussion
is by no means one of mere words. Again, the discussion of the

   probable that they were below the Bala limestone, because they were                                                 at
a much less sectional distance from the Harlech grits      Nant Francon than          of
was the Bala limestone from the same grits near the Merioneth anticlinal.

496            Prof. Sedgwick on the May Hill Sandstone,
and taking up in 1832 the task where I had left it in 1831,                  I
crossed other nearly symmetrical undulations till               I  established
the great Merioneth anticlinal.           It is the key to the structure of
North Wales, whether we take sections north and south from the
apseoftheanticlinal to the mountainsof Festiniog, or make parallel
east and west sections from different parts of the anticlinal across
the Berwyn chain, and thence to the carboniferous or triassic
groups on the English frontier; for we have a base of Llanberris
slates and Harlech grits whereon to construct the sections*. From
this base, them,     I constructed a section over Great Arenig to the
Bala limestone, and from that limestone over the Berwyn chain,
near the line of the Llanrhaidr road; and a second section
further south so as to pass down the Llanwdden valley; and
they gave similar results. From the base line, or Merioneth
anticlinal, to the Bala limestone is an ascending section of
enormous thickness.            Above the limestone the section on the
first line is still ascending for some thousand feet, when the
eastern dip is reversed so as to throw the beds into a synclinal
 form, on the eastern side of which, and just beyond the water
 shed of the chain, the Bala limestone is again brought out,
 beyond which we have a descending section through inferior
 slate and porphyries. The second (or Llawdden) line repeats the
 synclinal, and brings out the Bala limestone far west of the
 southern Berwyn watershed.             There are other complicated phº
 momena in this section which          I  cannot dwell on heref.
     In like manner,    during     1832,  I examined the northern part of
 the Berwyn chain. Older Cambrian rocks are there seen on the
 highest crest; and them after a great flexure and perhaps fault,
 are overlapped by a great series of the upper Bala beds, which
 give an ascending section with a northern dip as far as Corwen.
 I  afterwards determined the place of a great group composed of
 sandstones, slates, and more rarely of conglomerates, which form
 the base of the Denbigh flag, and, along with that flag, range
 in a position discordant to the Bala rocks. This group believed     I
 to be immediately superior to the Cambrian slates of Corwen,
 though the sections were broken and discontinuous.
     All the facts and inferences above stated were discussed, and
                          I
    * By Harlech grits mean a remarkable stage of coarse siliceous sand
 stone, sometimes almost a conglomerate, which overlies the great Llanberris
 and Nant Francon slate quarries.        Its finest exhibition is in the Rhinog
 Fawr chain between Festiniog and Dolgelly. In the Government Survey it
 is called Barmouth sandstone; and if         I  mistake not, includes a larger
 group of strata than    I  include under the Harlech grits. As the typical
 grits under Harlech Castle are a detached mass of the rock, I am not sure
                                                                      -

 498           Prof. Sedgwick      on the May Hill Sandstone,
 found in 1836+. In a country like South Wales we may rejoice
 if we can but take one safe step.            I then made two complete
 traverses across the      Upper    Cambrian groups of South Wales,
 between the Silurian terrace and the sea, still looking and in
 quiring for a trace of the Bala limestone, but in vain.             But I
 did gain what I thought good evidence to prove, that the equi
 valent of the Bala limestone, whatever form it now took, was
 not far from the base of the great undulating series of South
 Wales; and from this opinion I have never swerved.
     To examine the Llandeilo sections of the Towy was not then my
 object, but I crossed two lines, pointed out to me by Murchison,
 which seemed to connect the Llandeilo Flag with the base of the
 Wenlock terrace.        This done, I made a hasty traverse through
 a portion of the South Welsh coalfield, and so ended the labours
 of one summer, the hardest I think of my geological life.
     In 1833 I was, during the early summer months, crippled by
 illness and incapable of taking the field; but I saw the beautiful
 Silurian sections which were exhibited before the British Asso
                                                               I
 ciation by the author of the “Silurian System;’ and also gave a
 short summary of my results in Cambria as above described;
 and I remarked that our work seemed to be interlaced on the
 east side of the Berwyns, and that we could not connect our
 groups together without some joint labour in the field.
     In 1834 we did visit, together, the best Silurian sections from
 Caermarthenshire to Denbighshire.            I believed the sections on
 what appeared the evidence of demonstration; they were the
                                                           I
 most clear and striking I had ever beheld; but never saw their
 base, or considered their relations as admitting of any doubt.
 I  accepted them as they were offered in the supposed Silurian
 order of superposition (fig. 5. p. 313).           But when we reached
 the sections on the eastern side of the        Berwyns,   a country I had
 previously examined,      I  became startled at the conclusions which
followed. The Meifod and Craig-y-Glyn beds were pronounced
 to be Caradoc and Llandeilot.           Now if the Meifod beds were
 Lower   Silurian,   then the    Glyn  Ceiriog  beds must also be Lower
 Silurian.     But the Bala limestone and calcareous slate were not
 Lower Silurian, because they underlaid the great Upper Cam
 brian series of South Wales, over which, in the Silurian sections,
 were placed the Lower Silurian rocks.            On this point there was,
in fact, no difference of opinion; for, as a conclusion from the
Berwyn sections alone, my friend excluded the Bala limestone
    * The visit in 1836 was made for the purpose of comparing the Culm
trough of Devon with that of South Wales.        When my friend and fellow:
labourer had left me, I devoted a few days to the older Cambrian rocks of
Pembrokeshire.

two sub-groups, but had greatly mistaken their place in the

Sir R. I. Murchison himself) for the whole Cambrian series,
it being expressly understood that wherever the demarcation
could be drawn,                all

      I
     believe the Director of the Government Survey thought that
I had abandoned my old momenclature (and well might he think
so after what           I
                  have stated respecting the tampering with the
names of my reduced map), and that the Silurian momenclature
was to be taken as a fact established; and hence, that the primary
object of the Surveyors was to follow out, and give meaning                                                            to,
the Lower Silurian groups.             this              Be

by the name Llandeilo flag, is to blink, and not to solve, the
difficulties of a most intricate and perplexing country; but to
determine the western emergence of the Llandeilo flag of the
Towy (whatever be the mineral type it puts on) would be a real
step in physical geology.     Nor is the country altogether without
fossils; for example, in the district north of the Devil’s Bridge,
and in the upper valley of the Cothi, where to the well-known
Diplograpsus pristis M'Coy added a second old Cambrian grap
tolite.                      I
           Nor should yet despair of finding May Hill or Wen
lock beds among the great folds of South Wales; but I must not
lengthen out a paper already far too long, by enlarging on
speculations and hypotheses.                   -
    Once for  all, then, I confidently affirm,   that the great Cam
brian series is a natural and true   series, and that its subdivisions
have been   rightly  named. On the other     hand,            I
                                                     contend that the
classification and momenclature of the same series in the scheme
of the Government Survey is erroneous and untenable, 1st.
Because it overlooked the true physical and palaeontological base
of the Silurian series; 2nd. Because its nomenclature is but an
expansion of Silurian names derived from sections which were
not true to nature. 3rd. Because no section, within the limits
 of Siluria, gives us a good older Palaeozoic type. 4th. Because
the nomenclature of the Cambrian series (as given in the Survey)
 was not deduced from the natural groups; but, on the contrary,
 the natural groups were so packed as to fall in with a previous
(Silurian) nomenclature, which was based on erroneous sections.
5th. Because it introduces two different and incongruous schemes
of nomenclature into one system, and consequently involves the
nomenclature in most needless geographical contradictions and
incongruities.    There ought never to have been any controversy
on the questions I have been discussing; and since the establish
ment of the May Hill sandstone, there is now at least no shadow
of reason for its continuance.
                                      Conclusion.
   Before   I
            close this paper permit me to notice, as shortly as                      I
can, one or two points which do not affect the conclusions have                I
vindicated, but do belong to the history of the controversy, and
to my conduct in          it.                 -

the sectional truth of a part of another series, which turned out
to be wrong.

   Another paragraph       my letter
                                   of       follows:—“When the

 groups would offer a sufficiency of new forms to characterize an in
 ferior system,”              I
                      can only reply, that the hope to which he clung

 was not derived from anything had ever said or written; and that
I  had not, in 1842 and 1843, the shadow of a hope that any new
 system of animal life, any group of new forms “marking an                                                  in
ferior system,” would be found among the Lower Cambrian
groups.            I
               had constantly expressed, and repeatedly published,
a directly contrary opinion.”
     Ithen quote the fact (published in Jan. or Feb. 1837) that my
small collection of the most common and characteristic species o
the Bala limestone, was found by Mr. Sowerby not to have as
much as one which was not in his MS. Silurian lists. Again,
in 1838, I state                           (in
                              the Proceedings           the Geol. Soc.),       of

 to the Silurian system; but on what authority?         On the sole
 authority of the Lower Silurian sections, and of the author’s man

facesof transparent bodies, given by Fresnel and Brewster, are
only approximate laws, except in the case of some glasses of a
certain refractive index and reflecting power, in which the laws
of Brewster and Fresnel become as exact as can be expected in
such experiments.     But although the fact that these laws are
only approximate was well known, it was not until the experi
ments of M. Jamin were published that we had a numerical
statement of the extent of deviation from these generally received
laws. These experiments are published in the Annales de Chimie
et de Physique, vol. xxix. p. 263, and must be regarded as a
model of accurate and unprejudiced observations of facts. The
facts ascertained by M. Jamin in his examination are summed
up by him as follows:—
   1st. That almost     solid substances polarize light imperfectly
                                  all
by reflexion.
   2nd. That they transform            incident plane-polarized beam

508             The Rev. S. Haughton on                       some new       Laws
is not peculiar to                 formulae, but that Mr. Green's
                          M. Cauchy’s
formulae (subject to a modification which      have suggested) ex   I
plain the facts at least as well as M. Cauchy's.
   Since writing the paper just mentioned,       have had an oppor      I
tunity of trying many experiments with an apparatus similar to
that used by M. Jamin, and fully described by him in pp. 271
276 of the memoir already quoted.        To avoid repetition, refer                       I
the reader to M. Jamin's    description,  and shall proceed at once
to a description of the new facts which I have been fortunate
enough to ascertain.
   It occurred to me, on reading M. Jamin's memoir and repeat
ing some of his experiments, that it would be instructive to
ascertain the position of the major axis of the reflected elliptically
polarized light, and to tabulate the ratio of the axes of the ellipse
for different conditions of incidence and azimuths of incident
plane-polarized light. I accordingly investigated formulae                                           for
the position and ratio      axes ofterms     the quantities measured
                                            in                of
in by
    direct experiment.    The details    this investigation are given

observation, have succeeded
                I                establishing the following facts

elliptically-polarized light diminishes from infinity                               at    0°       to   a

principal incidence; and as the incident angle increases from the
principal incidence to 90°, the axis major moves from OB to
 Oy and back again to OG.
    Previous to entering upon a description of the experiments by
 which the foregoing six laws are proved, it will be useful to show
by an example the manner in which the received laws of Fresnel
 and Arago deviate from the observed facts.
    According to Fresnel, if a unit"of light be polarized in the
 plane of incidence and reflected from an uncrystalline transparent
 body, the intensity of the reflected beam will be measured by the
 square of the fraction
                              _- sin (i-r)          -    -    -     -  -     -  (1)

 of light be polarized in a plane perpendicular to the plane of                 in

cidence, the intensity of the reflected light will                                      be measured           by
the square of the fraction
                                               _tan (i-r)                                                        (3)

polarized in a plane making an azimuth A with the plane of in

of the compensator as follows:—
   It is known from a comparison of the wave theory of thin
plates with Newton’s experimental laws, that if a beam of light
be reflected perpendicularly from a transparent surface, there is
a difference of phase of 180° between the incident and reflected
light; a fact which has been admirably illustrated by Dr. Young,
by means of the analogy of the impact of elastic balls. The differ

Tables VII., VIII., IX. proves the truth                                                   of Law IV.
   The principal incidence is 55° 13', and                                                 the quantity of light in
the plane of incidence is to the quantity                                                  of light in the perpen
dicular plane as 1:1-82.
   Having ascertained the truth of the                                                     six laws stated             at the
commencement       of                 removed the compensator and
                                     this paper,                      I
made the following direct experiment, by which is shown the
possibility of obtaining circularly-polarized light by means of a
single reflexion, not total, at the surface of a transparent body:—
                          Angle of incidence                                .     .        =55° 0'

   On turning the analyser round through 360°, it was not pos
sible to detect any change in the intensity of the light, which
was therefore                sensibly circularly polarized, proving the truth of
Law III. directly.
  The truth of Laws II.,   III., IV. is made very evident by                                                                the

case unless the trinomial hº–2pur-H Crº be equivalent to a single
term of the second order of small quantities. To satisfy this
condition, the constants h and C must be related to each other.
The required relation may be found as follows. Put for r in the
above expression w-Hv, and assume w to be much larger than v.
Then the expression becomes
                       h°–2p (w-H v)+C(w-H        v)*,

and
                                –2p-H2Cw=0.

                             w=%               #.
    The reasoning by which the above relation between h and C
is deduced, appears to be perfectly cogent.               I cannot, after the
fullest consideration, perceive that any step can be called in
question. It may be observed that the constant C was intro
duced by an integration performed anterior to any limitation of
the question, and that the relation between h and C results from
the limitation given to the problem by assuming the moon’s
true motion in longitude to differ little from a mean motion.
It is not my intention to introduce the equation h’C=p.” into
the investigation at present, because         I wish to prove, first, that
if h and C be     regarded     as  independent   of each other, the solu
tion of the lunar     problem     deduced from the equation (C) is iden
tical with the ordinary solution.         It must, however, be borne in
mind, that if the foregoing reasoning be good, neither method
of solution ought, in strict logic, to be proceeded with until the
above relation between the constants has been deduced”.
    * As in this part of the reasoning my method is distinguished from every
other that has been applied to the lunar theory,    I will endeavour to put the
argument in as succinct a form as possible, that it may be the more readily

    Suppose the expression   —Crº–h4+2ur--            to contain terms higher
in  value than the last term.
    Then the only legitimate   process of approximation is to integrate, ne
glecting the small term, so as to obtain an approximate value of r, to sub
stitute this value in the small term and integrate again, and so on.
    By this process the approximation commences with a fixed, ellipse of
arbitrary eccentricity, and is found in succeeding steps to introduce terms
which may increase indefinitely with the time, and which are therefore       in
 compatible with the hypothesis that the true values of the radius-vector and
the longitude differ little from mean values.

   The limited time which has elapsed since the publication of
M. Regnault’s experiments prevents my being yet able to bring
the details of the investigation, of the formulae, and of the com
parison of their results with those of experiment, into a shape
suited for publication; but                          I
                                  shall here add some remarks on
their  degree  of accuracy and the extent of their applicability.
   8. M.   Regnault   explains, that his experiments were made by
two methods; at low temperatures, by determining the pressure of
the vapour in vacuo; at high temperatures, by determining the
boiling-point under the pressure of an artificial atmosphere. For
each fluid, the pressures determined by both those methods were
compared throughout a certain series of intermediate tempe
ratures.
   For     all
           fluids        state   absolute purity, the results

                 Maximum Pressure and Latent Heat                                of    Vapours.           533
       Essence        of   has been discovered by M. Regnault to
                           Turpentine
undergo a molecular change by continued boiling.         For this
fluid the  agreement   between the formula and the experiments is
satisfactory above 40° Centigrade, and up to the limit of the
experiments, 222°, but not below 40°.
    It is impossible to obtain Chloroform free from an admixture
of foreign substances.      Accordingly, M. Regnault has found
that the two methods of determining the pressure of the vapour
of this fluid give widely different results, neither of which can be
represented accurately by the formula now proposed below the
temperature of 70° Cent. From this temperature, however, up
to 130° Cent., the limit of the experiments, the agreement is
close.

           the cases of alcohol and turpentime, the discrepancies
           10.
between the formulae and the experiments at very low tempera
tures are such as to indicate that they might be removed by                                                   in
troducing a fourth term into the formulae, inversely proportional
to the cube of the absolute temperature; but the trifling and
uncertain advantage to be thus obtained would be outweighed
by the inconvenience in calculation, and especially by the neces
sity for solving a cubic equation in computing the temperature
from the pressure; whereas with formulae of three terms, it is
only necessary to extract a square root, as the formula No. 2
shows.

536              Mr.       J. J.          Sylvester's Note on Burman's Law for
man’s general formula. I recently have had occasion (as a prelimi
nary step to the investigation of the laws of inverse transformation
between two systems of t variables each, instead of between two
single variables only, an investigation in which        have already                                          I
made such progress that I expect shortly to be in possession of
the general formula for the purpose) to reconsider what I shall
term Burman’s law, and have been somewhat surprised to find,
that so far from affording a complicated expression, it does, when
properly stated, give rise to an expression of the very simplest
form that could be conceived or desired, and one that admits of
an easy and elementary proof.
    To fix the ideas, let us take the case of

      of the caeca, so as to form a rude network.        This arrangement is
      peculiarly well marked in Terebratula caput-serpentis, as shown in the
      figure (fig. 2); and to those who are familiar with the condition of the
      circulating apparatus in the inferior Mollusca, it is scarcely possible
      not to recognize in it a ‘sinus-system,” corresponding to that which
      is formed in the Tunicata by the partial adhesion of the second and
      third tunics to each other.
          Considered under this point of view, the caecal structure (as was
      first suggested to me by my friend Mr. T. H. Huxley) bears a close
      resemblance to the vascular prolongations, which, in many Asci
      dians, pass from the sinus-system into the substance of the “test;’
      the chief difference lying in this,    that whilst each of the vascular
      prolongations into the “test” of the Ascidians contains both an affe
      rent and an efferent canal,—no such distinction ordinarily manifests
      itself in these prolongations of the intra-palleal sinus-system of Tere
      bratula, although      I
                            have met with indications of it in Crania. Their
      cascal character, however, is by no means opposed to the views I
      am now giving of their physiological nature; for it has been shown
      by M. de Quatrefages, that the prolongations of the ‘general cavity
      of the body,’ which pass into the branchiae and other appendages of
      Annelida, transmitting to them                  its
                                              nutritive fluid for acration, are
      always caecal, notwithstanding     that they are sometimes distributed

in optical spectra, embraced the results in respect of colour in the
images impressed on the retina, as derived simply from the influence
of light.                                      -
    The    optical spectra from  white, gray, or black opake objects under
faint   illumination,   or of ordinary  windows or apertures transmitting
low   degrees    of light, were usually  found to be without colour.   But
ordinary daylight, and, much more, the light from bright sunshine
(as is well known), yield chromatic spectra of vivid or brilliant hues.
By viewing with slightly closed eyes, the pictures impressed on the
retina by a few seconds' steady gazing at some fixed point of an
illuminated object, and noting the various effects, disappearances and
changes, a considerable number of characteristic phaenomena were
elicited, and the effects of a variety of modifying circumstances satis
factorily determined.        The most prevailing influences in modifying
 the phaenomena—whatever other causes might tend to the produc
tion of variation in the colours—were found to be referable to differ
 ences in the degree of intensity of the external light, in the extent
 of time occupied in gazing at the illuminated object, in the quantity
 of light penetrating the chamber of the eye whilst examining the
 spectra, and in the normal condition of the eye itself.      These, with
 other modifying circumstances, had been somewhat elaborately           in
 vestigated.
     Different degrees of light, whether reflected from white objects,
 or transmitted by colourless glass, had obviously the tendency to
 yield differences in the colours of the primarily developed pictures
 on the retina, with corresponding varieties in the nature and number
 of the subsequent changes. Thus the viewing for a few seconds of
 an aperture in a window the size of a pane of glass, whilst all the
 rest was covered with a thick brown-paper screen, gave, with a low
 degree of daylight, transparent pictures of a dingy orange, olive, yel
 low-gray or bluish black tint, changing, most usually, into a rusty
 tinted blackish spectrum, and disappearing, for the most part, in a
 minute of time or less. From medium degrees of daylight, the pri
 mary pictures embraced a considerable variety of colours, such as
  crimson-pink, purple-pink, violet, purple, indigo, blue,        the blue
  being the highest in the scale of intensity.          The most marked
  changes, commencing with blue, were usually from blue to red, or
 to crimson, olive, black fading into blackish gray.       In certain cases
 rapid and evanescent glances were had of several intermediate colours.
 The general photochromatic effects of the higher degrees of light,
  such as from a clear sky in full sunshine, were far more uniform
 than those from inferior light. The spectrum first elicited, even
 after viewing a window or window-aperture for three or four seconds
 only, was almost always green, with the character of illuminated
 transparency; the shades of colour however varied with the inten
 sity of the impression.       The picture always appeared within four
 or five seconds after closing the eyes, and when the light had been
 strong and the gazing continued for a quarter of a minute or more,
 the picture would burst out almost instantly. The restoration of
 the picture in new colours, after the vanishing, had very much the

  character and appearance of the dissolving views effected by the magic
  lanthorn.    The frame of the window or aperture, and the cross
  bars, were always pictured in colours different from those of the
  panes, besides a fine marginal line of another colour dividing the
  glass and the frames. These consequential colours, constitute, as is
  well known, a remarkable feature in the phaenomena.           They have
  generally a certain complementary relation, or tendency to such, to
  the colours of the primary picture.     Thus in the clear green or blue
 spectrum of a window, derived from strong illumination, the re
  mainder of the field of the eye will generally, in the first instance,
  be covered with a ground of glowing crimson, with cross-bars simi
 lar, and purple edgings; and when the picture changes to crimson
  or red, the antagonistic tint will also change, perhaps to purple, or
 orange or brown.      The original spectra were found to fade away at
 intervals, often of tolerable equality, such as of eight or nine seconds,
 disappearing perhaps for two or three seconds, and then reappearing
 under, generally, some change of shade or tint, through an extent of
 very numerous repetitions.      The changes of colour from the bright
 or emerald green, as very frequently traced, went rapidly through
 yellow-green, yellow, orange, red, scarlet, crimson and brown, or olive.
 And this series, it is observable, is particularly accordant, in respect
 to the principal or fundamental colours, with that of the prismatic
 spectrum from green to yellow, orange and red. These visual photo
 graphs, besides having the sharpest definition, and often the most
brilliant illuminated colours, were found to possess, under strong
 intensities of impression, a remarkable degree of permanency—ex
tending sometimes to endurance for an hour or longer after the act
of gazing.
    Investigations on the relation of the photochromatic developments
 to the time of gazing, gave results in many respects corresponding
 with those derived from differences in the degree of external light.
Thus the higher colours of the spectral series elicited by strong light,
could, within certain limits, be also developed by more continuous
gazing with inferior light: so that the pink-coloured spectrum de
rived from ten to twenty seconds’ gazing in low degrees of light,
could be elicited by a single glance under bright sunshine.           The
results, therefore, were clearly in relation to the intensity of the im
pression; and, taken in the form of a general proposition, we shall
not be far wrong, perhaps, in considering the intensity of impression
as the product of the time of gazing into the relative quantity of
light admitted by the aperture.
  The relation of the colours primarily elicited to the intensity of
the impression, yielded (comparatively and roughly       taken) the   fol
lowing series,—crimson-pink,   purple-pink, purple, blue, green, the
                                                                    -
latter being the produce of the highest intensity tried.
   As in the foregoing researches, the relative degrees of light were
but broadly assumed, whilst the comparative experiments comprised
a variety of differences affecting the photochromatic          results,
another series of experiments on the simple effects of degrees of
light was instituted, in which    all
                                  these other differences were elimi

nated.     In this series the quantity of light was varied by partial or
sectional screens of glass, or other transparent or semitransparent
substances. The results were particularly satisfactory,          different
tints or shades of colour being obtained by the same view and in the
same spectrum of a window-aperture, when different thicknesses of
window glass were placed in the several sections (six in number) into
which the aperture was divided.
    A beautiful example of the chromatic effects of partial and varied
screening of light on the optical spectrum elicited, was incidentally
obtained by viewing an aperture in the clouds, when the sky was
otherwise densely covered. After gazing for a few seconds on the
middle of this aperture, the spectrum, as viewed with gently closed
eyes, exhibited a singular variety of the richest tints according to the
differences in the light screened off by the edges of the cloud and
by certain little patches within the aperture. The spectrum resem
bled the variegation and richness of colouring as elicited in certain
transparent or semitransparent substances when examined by polar
ized light.
    The experiments on binocular and multiple spectra, as described
in Part I. of the author's paper, being repeated under degrees of
light adequate for yielding colour, gave pictures, in many cases, of
much interest and beauty. The multiple spectra, however, which
proved the most strikingly beautiful, were derived from the sun,
which was viewed indirectly, and on occasions, near setting, in winter,
when the intensity of its light was duly subdued by passing through
a dense condition of atmosphere.      Under such circumstances, images,
sometimes in 100 to 150 repetitions, were impressed on the retina
by rapid glances at the sky immediately around the sun. These were
taken by quick movements of the head, winking intermediately, at
the rate of 60 to 120 impressions in the minute; and the result,
when viewed with closed eyes, presented a splendid spectacle like a
 cluster of coloured stars, or rather of round planetary discs, brilliant
 in green, yellow, orange, red, crimson and purple !
    Besides the experiments thus far described, in which the spectral
 images were viewed, for the most part, with gently closed eyes kept
 steadily in the direction in which the objects were gazed on, the
 differences, which were often very remarkable, produced by alter
 ations in the quantity of light admitted into the chamber of the eye
 whilst the image was viewed, were also investigated.          Sometimes
 the smallest change in the light thus transmitted was found to alter
 greatly the character of the spectrum.       In certain cases, the com
 pressing of the eyelids, or the mere passing of the hands betwixt the
 eyes and the light, would serve to change a negative picture into a
 positive, or the colours, as viewed in the usual way, into their com
 plementary tints.

 plications and general results.-1. As to the elucidation yielded by

 illusions.—6. As to the practical use of the process of examining the
 ocular spectra, for the determination of quantities of light relatively
intercepted by different portions or thicknesses of glass or other trans
parent media.—7. For assisting in the determination of the relative
 degrees of illumination of lamps, candles, &c., and of quantities of
light reflected from opake objects.-8. For aiding in the selection
and harmonizing of colours in ornamental and decorative depart
ments of art.—9. For the examination of the condition of the inte
rior of the eyes in certain states of disease. The author having had
the opportunity of trying this process in case of amaurosis, found
that it afforded a perfect picture of defects in the surface of the
retina of the eyes separately, when there was no visible defect, and
when the patient had no other perception of a diseased eye, or patch
on the retinal surface, except the partial distortion or interruption
of vision.    Founded on this, the author suggests a plan of scotome
trical examination of retinal defects, by which not only the accurate
form and relative proportions of diseased patches on the retina may
be determined, but their actual dimensions may probably be deduced.

the glycerine being added by a few drops at a time.
    It is heavier than water, in which it is slightly soluble, and is
soluble in alcohol and in aether.
    From its proneness to decomposition in drying, even by the air

of constitution discovered by Wurtz may be conceived as basic.
The processes for preparing the compound are thus described by
 Mr. Railton.
   1st. When three atoms of absolute alcohol are acted upon by one
atom of PC13, this compound is formed.    The alcohol is introduced
into a retort which is connected with an apparatus for upward distil
lation, and the retort is surrounded with a freezing mixture.   The
terchloride is then added drop by drop, the whole is then gently
heated for some time, the vapour being allowed to run back into the
 retort.    It is now distilled and the portion which comes off between
 140°C. and 196°C. collected and redistilled, that portion being pre
 served which boils between 188° and 191° C.                The quantity of pure
 aether obtained by this process was not large, and there was left in
the retort a considerable amount of PO3 and other products, which
 on further heating evolved inflammable phosphuretted hydrogen.
    2nd. This aether is obtained with the greatest facility from aethyl
 ate of soda and terchloride of phosphorus.
    I introduce into a thirty ounce stoppered retort about a pint of
aether, which must be perfectly free from alcohol and from water.
The aethylate of soda is then added, and as much PCl3 is taken as
is necessary to form chloride of sodium and phosphite of aethyle. The
aether is absolutely necessary, for without              the action    it,
                                                                        the PCl3                 of                 is

                                    the aethylate.
   The PCl3          introduced into the mixture
                      is                                                   of

soda through           long funnel, which
                          a                         drawn        isextremely fine to   an

                                                     drop into the mixture, thus
avoiding the violent action which otherwise occurs.

   These results being satisfactory as regards the formula, the den
sity of the vapour was then ascertained and found to be in strict
accordance with theory.      The method of taking the vapour densities
of bodies liable to oxidation was described by me about twelve months
ago, in the Chemical Society's Quarterly Journal.      It was used in
the following experiments.
   1st. Weight of globe filled with air at 53°F. and 30.2 in. baro

   -05 cub. in. hydrogen at 60°F. become 094 cub. in. at 521°F.,
and weigh .002 gr.
   6:40–'094=6:306 cub. in. vapour at 521°F., which at 60°F.
and 30 in. barometer = 3:376 cub. in.
   Hence 192:387–'002=192:385–186.313=6-072                grains, the
weight of 3:376 cub. in. vapour.
                    100 cubic inches... = 179-86 grs.
                    100 cubic inches air= 31-01 grs.
The density is therefore 5'800, from which it appears that      its   com
bining measure  isfour volumes.

white flame, is soluble in water, alcohol, and aether, and is slowly
decomposed in contact with air.
   On boiling phosphite of aethyle with concentrated solution of baryta,
in water, it is decomposed into alcohol and a salt which varies
according to the amount of baryta used.        If one atom of the aether
be treated with one of baryta, a crystallized salt is produced on eva
poration, the carbon and hydrogen in which are, according to an
analysis I have just completed,—

    In that marked ‘required” I have supposed the salt to bear the fol
lowing formula and to be completely anhydrous, 20°H*O, BaO, PO3,
but if we suppose that four atoms of water are present in the salt
analysed, the relation will stand thus:

                          5' 356            5'540
    The formula would then be 2C4H8O, BaO, PO3 + 4HO.
    When two atoms of baryta are made to act upon one atom of
the aether, a salt is obtained which does not crystallize, and it may
be evaporated in air without sensible decomposition.      This salt is per
fectly neutral to test paper; when dry it is a white friable delique
scent mass, the formula of which will be C4H8O, 2BaO, POS.                If
an excess of baryta is used, a white salt is thrown down on boiling,
which I suppose to be HO, 2.BaO, PO9.
    I have prepared another compound with three equivalents of amyle.
This was obtained from amylate of soda by an analogous process to
that described for the phosphite of aethyle.
    Analysis has pointed out the formula 3C19H110, P09. Like
phosphite of aethyle it is easily decomposed on being heated in air;
heated in hydrogen it is more stable and then boils at 236°C.          It is
soluble in aether and in alcohol, but only slightly soluble in water.
    “On   the Constitution of Coal-tar Creosote.”      By Prof. William
 SOIl.                                                              s
    For some years past it has been a debated question among che
 mists, whether the peculiar body originally described by Reichen
bach as creosote, and subsequently analysed by Ettling and others,
has any real existence, or whether the properties which were attri
buted to it are not to be more correctly ascribed to the hydrate of
phenyle, which can be obtained in a state of great purity from at
least one sort of commercial creosote by mere distillation, and which
possesses in an eminent degree the antiseptic properties for which
 creosote is remarkable.
    With a view of obtaining some light on this question, Mr. Fairlie
 undertook, in the laboratory of University College, an investigation
 of the portions of coal-tar creosote which boil higher than the hydrate
 of phenyle. The result of his experiments has been to show that a

body homologous to hydrate of phenyle may be obtained from the
crude creosote, in fact the next term of the series above hydrate of
phenyle itself.    Some qualities of commercial creosote contain a
greater quantity of this hydrate of cresyle (as it may be termed) than
others; and it is most advantageously prepared from those portions
which in the first distillation come over between 200° Cent. and 220°.
After a great number of fractional distillations, a colourless, highly
dispersive liquid is obtained, boiling at 203°Cent., and possessing
the composition represented by the formula C14H8O2.
   This hydrate of cresyle resembles the corresponding phenyle com
pound in most of its properties; but it may be easily distinguished
from that compound by           almost complete insolubility

somewhat difficult and tedious manipulation necessary, when com
paratively accurate determinations were required. The most serious
impediment        carrying out the usual alkalimetrical processes, arises,
                        in
            known,                               carbonic acid, the presence

 mercial carbonate contains only about 50 per cent.            Now in the
 several alkalimetrical processes employed in the arts, the 50 per
 cent. of alkali is estimated, and not the 85 per cent. of impurities.
 Constituting, as these impurities invariably do, by far the smaller
 proportion of the commercial alkalies or alkaline carbonates, it will
 in practice, I believe, be found advantageous to employ a method
 which, by indicating the amount of impurities present, will give the
 available proportion of alkali.
    As I have previously remarked, the primary difficulty to be over
 come is the entire expulsion of carbonic acid, the presence of but
 a small quantity of which entirely prevents accurate determination,
 not only owing to the change of tint produced by            presence                             its                    on   a

     The apparatus I have found most convenient for containing and
 preserving standard solutions, and more particularly solutions of
 ammonia, consists of a vessel similar to a wash-bottle, to which
 is attached an India rubber bulb ; so that when it is desired to fill the
 burette, it is only necessary to compress the bulb.     This arrange
 ment affords   great  facility for replenishing  the burette;   and by
 placing a piece of India rubber tubing, closed at one end, on the
jet, an air-tight reservoir for the solution is obtained.—Chem. Gaz.
