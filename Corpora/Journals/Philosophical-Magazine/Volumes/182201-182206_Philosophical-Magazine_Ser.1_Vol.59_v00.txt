 layer through the wood even to the root, and have shown me that
 each mark is peculiar to the sort of wood to which it belongs.

 large numbers together; they generally appear grouped in a
 circle, as at Plate I. fig. 1; and it is hardly possible to pass
 through the wood, and then take fibre from fibre, without en
 countering innumerable buds thus passing up from the root per
pendicularly, or crossing the stem at right angles to            former     its
 direction.     As    is

tween the animal and vegetable world.
   In the various comments made on my work, many said it was
absolutely impossible the bud should come from the root, that
there was no occasion to dissect wood to be convinced of that
proposition; in short, it was affirmed in as many words that there
was no occasion to examine woods ; that they possessed so per
fect and so intuitive a knowledge of nature independent of                 in
quiry, as made it unnecessary.      Another gentleman assured my
friend that the fact was well known, and exactly described by
Sir J. Smith. To put an end to this objection, I shall transcribe
his own observation in his work on physiological botany.       He
says, “Mr. Knight in the Philosophical Transactions for 1805
has shown that buds originate in the alburnum next the bark,
as might indeed have been expected.”      This seems to show that
Sir J. Smith is of the same opinion. This opinion is certainly
very different from mine, as I have repeatedly shown that they
protrude from the root. Willdenow thought that they were
formed in the bark.       Du Hamel gave no decided opinion on
the  subject.   How these gentlemen could suppose they passed
through the bark first, when the round head of the bud first ap
pears peeping through the wood, I cannot conceive.              Grew
alone has announced that he has seen the bud pass up through
the middle of the plant in the interior, full six months before it
shows itself at the exterior of the plant: he must therefore have
seen it in the root; for the new shoot, at the top of which they
afterwards appear, could not at that time be formed. How then
should the bud be protruded there       'Tis plain, therefore, it ap
pears, even at the exterior, first in a lower part of the plant.
   The buds passing from the root will alone explain some cu
rious passages to be found in Cicero and Pliny, where they de
scribe the situation of the tree when the buds were running up:
and it is plain that the secret of cutting down the tree at the
proper season, was carefully preserved by the few who possessed
it, with the most strict attention paid     the time; otherwise the
                                               to

 *    The Flemish farmers find their weeds not only drawn for them, but
taken off, and the ground thoroughly weeded     byhand labour     spring; and
                                                                   in

by  the neighbouring poor, for the purpose      procuring the food for their
                                               of
cattle; and those very poor who have not cattle, are paid for gathering        it
for those that have. The farmer   isthus freed from nuisance, and the food

      Pliny's description of the lesser Maple (the ancient Bruscum)
  is well worth citing in the original; and immediately brought to
  my mind the different figures of the roots of various trees when
  cut down at the proper season; for this does not last above a
 fortnight or three weeks at most, in any tree; but if taken within
  that time, most roots form a very beautiful picture which explains
  many passages in both authors.        The trees which have this pro
  perty are the Yew, the Citron, and the Maple, not only the Italian
  but the French one.      Pliny’s description is: “Acer, operum ele
  gantiá et subtilitate Citro secundum, Gallicum in Transpadana
  Italia transque Alpes nascens. Alterum genus, crispo macularum
 discursu, qui, cum excellentior fuit, asimilitudine caudae pavonum
 nomen accepit.”        There are several kinds, especially the white,
 which is wonderfully beautiful. This is called the French Maple,
 growing in that part of Italy that is on the other side of the Po,
 beyond the Alps. The other has a curled appearance so curious
  (fig. 5), that from a near resemblance it was usually called the
 Peacock's Tail. Lib. xvi. c. 16. It is very curious that I should
 have some of this curled figured wood so exactly described by Pliny,
 in many foreign woods (fig. 7) as well as the Maples, and in the
 Bird's Eye American Maple, which of course they could not then
 know, that directly showed me what Pliny meant.          He goes on to
 comment on those of      Istria, and those trees growing on the moun
 tains, and esteemed the best, and to sing forth the praises of the
 Bruscum knots. But the Molluscum was counted by the Romans
 as the most precious. I have among my Indian woods many spe
 cimens admirably marked; I have also one which rises up in
 stripes, and bears the appearance of a Fir within (fig. 6).       They
 are not     large enough   to make    any thing  but the ladies' sets of
 tables in fashion a few years past, but served to stand by the
 couches of the Romans when they dined, or after dinner; which
 gives a higher idea of their luxurious customs than any fact I have
 yet read of them. But I hope I shall never live to see that extra
 vagance imitated in this country, which gave rise to the curious
 Roman saying coinmon among the gentlemen of Rome, when
 they exclaimed that the ladies had “turned the tables on them.”
 As when they reproached the ladies with the expense of their
jewels and ornaments, the ladies reminded them of the tables
that had often cost from six to ten thousand sesterces; even the
grave Cicero gave, I think, and boasts of giving, eight thousand
for a set, and they must have been small.
     The Bruscum is more intricately crisped and curled than
the Molluscum (fig. 8); but the planks are larger and the
 pattern is fuller; “and had we,” says Cicero, “trees to make
                                                                       or

I have some very beautiful specimens of the Ash that takes a
perfect polish; it had the exact resemblance of a large crab, or
rather spider, which was not only displayed in the root, but
showed itself in one of the branches of a smaller size.         I had
also one of Beech that was in    regular stripes of green,  brown, or
pale yellow, constantly flowing from the iron and copper which
must have been nearly under the tap root, and which plainly
proves in what an exact line the sap flows: although this is not
the general opinion, it certainly evinces that there is no aperture
to let the sap pass from one layer of wood to the other; but
that each is completely inclosed within       own cylinder.       was its                           If  it
not  so, indeed, how could  poison  flow    one cylinder, and    per in                              a

   When it appeared that the heat no longer separated anything
from the black matter in the retort, which still however retained
a degree of fluidity, the apparatus was suffered to cool; during
which time the residuum became fixed, and to the eye resembled
pitch.
   The several products of the distillation above described being
carefully separated from each other, the more remarkable of them
were submitted to examination; but as leisure was wanting for
a full investigation of their characters, the Society is requested
to accept, with some indulgence, the following description of
such of their properties as were ascertained.

   Of all the characters of the white concrete substance described

     If a piece of cotton twine be coiled up like the wick of a can

thin transparent laminae.
    This experiment affords one mark of distinction between this
substance and benzoic acid, and also between it and camphor :
for, under similar circumstances, benzoic acid crystallizes in aci
cular crystals, which are often grouped in a stelliform manner;
and camphor crystallizes, or is rather congealed, in globular
particles having a stalagmitic appearance.
     The most usual crystalline form of this substance is a rhombic
plate, of which the greater angle appears to be from 100° to
 105°: crystals at least of that form I have repeatedly obtained

   It remains for me to propose a name for the white concrete
substance which has been described in this paper: and, unless a
more appropriate term should be suggested by others,                                                I   would
propose to call it Naphthaline.

not therefore         have been better to refer to some                   work of undoubted
reputation with the public, than to have attempted to explain
them by calculations, of which it cannot be said that any one
result is accurate 2 But in this manner his readers would have
been better able to judge of his consistency and fairness of
arguing, when they found him affirming gravely that there is no
want of convergency of the series, at the very time the default
of convergency obliges him to employ subsidiary expedients.
   By taking the whole values of the variable quantities at two
intervals, he seems to have considerably diminished the error
arising from the want of convergency of the series.    But, how
many intervals must be taken in order to exhaust it completely
We thus fall upon the same discussions agitated from the origin
of the science. At any rate it appears necessary that he push
his calculations up to the mark of truth, at least in some one
instance, before the methods he recommends can be fairly com
pared with those usually followed. But, however this be, it must
not be forgotten that the method of calculating by intervals, has
nothing to do with the construction of the table in the Nautical
Almanack.
  The formula used in the construction of the table contains
four terms; and the horizontal refraction in the table, is imme
diately found by solving the proper equation.       But when we take
a case of real theory; that                  is,

this must be considered as an imperfection and a blemish, if we
may be allowed to use such words in speaking of a matter that
so highly concerned the benefit of mankind. A few years ago,
the Academy of Sciences proposed, for their prize-question, the
Construction of Lunar Tables by Theory alone, the fortunate
competitors being M. Damoiseau and M.M. Plana and Carlini.
But, in the case of the refractions, we are desired to hold a re
trograde course, and are required to re-compute by an empirical
formula the very same numbers already calculated by theory.
   The author of the Apology misquotes my words, and slurs over
the question of the identity of his table with that of the French.
It is not enough to say that they agree in      ordinary cases; for            all

 tities as greatly to diminish, and even almost to annihilate, the
 differences between the formula and observation, or between the
 formula and a given table of refractions.  And this, 1 conceive,
 is a just and sufficient account of the coincidence between the
 tables of mean refraction in the Nautical Almanack and the
 Connaissance des Tems.                             -
   Suppose Dr. Young's formula with literal coefficients was given
to each of two computers, one in London and one in Paris; and
they were directed to determine the numerical values so as to
represent the French table: it is by no means clear that both
would hit upon the same numbers for the coefficients.        It will
not appear improbable to any one who has attended to the va
riety of numerical formulae for calculating the refractions *, that
the result of such an experiment might be, two different for
                                                                -

    It will not, I hope, be inferred from any thing that has been
said, that an empirical table of refractions is supposed to be of
little value. It can indeed have no value at all unless it have a
proper foundation of                 its

And such differences must always occur, unless some general
principles be adopted, or some general mode of solution can be
found out.
   Allow me, sir, before I conclude, to say a word about the
“Concessions” in your Mag. for last November.       It is not easy
to state distinctly what is conceded and what is withheld.    The
 balance seems to be poised with a very even hand, between the
 concessions to be made, and the tone of authority to be kept up.
 If F might presume to give an opinion, I would say that the only
error I am now charged with, relates to my number -00419 which
he makes 00416; amounting to                                 rºart
                                                 of an inch, if we speak

 the existing quantity.     There      some refinement  is     this way                      in
 reckoning; for the less the quantity, the greater the error.           am                                   I

    sonants alone—the simplest vowel characters devisable being
    subsequently applied, whether in the beginning, the middle or
    the end of words, as the writer shall consider them expedient.
        Thirdly, As to the reading of an extensive manuscript in which
    these or any other short-hand characters are solely used, with
    satisfactory readiness, at a glance, when the subject itself is                               al
    together or very nearly forgotten by the writer: although some
    of our stenographic bookmakers may insist on the facility of so
    doing, after a few months or even weeks of application; yet I
    cannot by any means hold out so fallacious an expectation.           On
    the contrary, years are indispensable: nor is it likely that any
    one gentleman in a thousand (I speak not of the professional
    stenographist) shall ever attain this ultimate object by any other
    process than that which I have seen successfully adopted;—the
    intermixing, with his common writing, the pronouns, auxiliary
    verbs, conjunctions and other minor parts of speech expressed
    in short-hand; and proceeding from thence, step by step, slowly
    yet systematically, to encroach upon his long-hand.
        Lastly, With respect to the possibility of ever following a
    speaker, verbatim, by the apparently slow method I have sug
    gested—the sequel shall determine.           In the mean time let the
    literary gentleman reflect, that even if no other object be attain
    able than that of expressing                all
                                          our ordinary words          short             in

reign of Elizabeth, and who, as we are informed, was the first
inventor of a stenographic Alphabet, which he dedicated to that
Queen.     I should even rally my countrymen upon their various
whimsies styled improvements of the art; such as the writing

which, like our musical stave, shall metamorphose one letter
into another at pleasure, or even dispense altogether with cer
tain commencing letters, through the agency of the name of that
place upon which the second letter shall be made.           Neither
should I hesitate to set forth the pedantic introduction, called
“ Invention,” of a whole host of Latin prepositions, such as
omni, post, and preter—ill suited to the genius of our language,
and calculated neither for perspicuity, nor, on the great average
of syllables, even for brevity itself. I should perhaps also state
the various important controversies of our very learned crypto
graphists—whether, in the writing of any individual word, the
hand should or should not be ever lifted at all: but as I cannot
ensure to myself a patient reading, by the unlearned world, of
such enlightened topics, I shall pass on in my own way with
the subject, and lay before you what many will consider a very
usefu though perhaps not a very amusing Table of    the short              all

   Note. The average number of words attachable to the fore
going table; or, in other terms, the average number of words
expressed by 6418 short-hand consonants, is 2743, which is
almost fractionally equal to 2+* such consonants for every indi
vidual word.     Arbitraries, it is true, may provide for some of
these ; but comparatively for so few that this table must serve,
with sufficient accuracy, as the basis of any intended calculation.
   Suppose that, for example's sake, I were to start a question,
Let the descending oblique right line                      /
                                             be excluded as an inde
pendent letter; and the writer be privileged to exchange, when
desirable, the perpendicular line I for the foregoing oblique
one  ....  thus obviating many difficult angles: What loss, then,
shall be sustained by adopting, for the letter L, the looped cha
racter A in place of the relinquished line               taking it for  /;
granted that looped characters, except in the beginning of words,
are nearly equal to simplest;-but that in the beginning of words,
or when alone, a loss equal to                l;
                                     right line is sustained by every
looped character
   In my opinion, this question may be solved by the judicious
application of our table, thus:
   Let the aggregate of our consonants, 6418, be rated on the
average, as equal to            l;
                          right line each [near enough for our

constantly takes but two short-hand characters, or thereabout, to every

or, in round numbers, 13,000.
   Now, if in writing a number = 13,000 right lines, the let
ter L, as an incipient, shall occur but 77 times, producing a loss
 = 115 right lines; the aggregated loss is evidently but the licth
part of the whole, or very nearly equal to half a minute in an
hour.
   Pursuing the same mode of calculation, incipient K, too, if
expressed by 6 N in place of       \,
                                  will yield a loss of almost ex
actly one minute in an hour;—and this sacrifice, as well as that
arising from the looped L (supposing even the aggregate loss           in
creased by one-half in consequence of the disadvantage of these
characters when intermediate or final), I shall make to a           cer

  * The plan of prepositives which I mean, by and by, to suggest, will
almost wholly remove the incipient disadvantage.

VI. On the boiling             Springs of Iceland.                  By Mr. John MURRAY.”
IN   reading the description of the boiling springs or geysers of
Iceland, as given to us by Stanley, Hooker, Mackenzie, and by
Henderson, I found it difficult to account for the intermission
of the jets, supposing the subterranean fire to continue uniform
in temperature.
   I caused an apparatus to be con
structed, which tended to explain the
phaenomena          of the intermission of the
jet and recession from the basin into
the central pipe.    A section of that
simple apparatus        is on the margin,
and     its
          phaenomena clearly and satis
factorily prove that the circumstances
adverted to, are ascribable                the  to
cooling       of
               the water from the united
influences         radiation and evapo
                   of
ration.       Radiation, from the sur
face of the water           the basin into
                               in
which    it rises; and   Evaporation,    from
that dispersed into the atmosphere

of the stalactites depending from the roof are hooked, or curved
upwards).     Now on this supposition, if a stone or stones were
thrown   in, either wholly or partially to blockade that orifice, the
steam  would be thereby confined, and sooner he raised to a
maximum, because the water is then prevented from            slow                                            its

   When raised in vapour over hot mercury, and detonated with
excess of oxygen, a quantity of carbonic acid gas and chloride of
mercury were produced.     There was no change in the volume
of gas used; and lime water being passed into it absorbed the
carbonic gas, became turbid, and left a residuum of pure oxy
gen.   Acetic acid being then added, to dissolve the carbonate
of lime, the solution was tested for chlorine, which was readily
found in  it.    When detonated with oxygen, the substance being

 1820, and continues to the end of the present year—that part,
 therefore, which remains unexpired, I now transmit. It is rather
 singular, that no one has already pointed out this circumstance

X. Trial of      Meridian Circle, made by Reiche NBACH

I  HoPED to be enabled to furnish you with a complete account
of the observations, hitherto made with the meridian circle of
Reichenbach; but several examinations (which appear to me to
be necessary) have not yet been completed; partly on account
of the very bad weather in this year, and partly on account of the
late arrival of a particular microscopical apparatus which Privy
 Counsellor Pistor has not only admirably contrived, but also
correctly executed for me.    This apparatus has been in my pos
session about a  month,  and I have already attained by it the ob
ject I had in view: but, there are still some things which I must
ascertain before I can assert that my declinations are so correctly
determined as this beautiful instrument seems capable of doing.
I could, indeed, produce many observations, such as the instru
ment has given them; and l could add that several improve
ments (which are not yet made) will be very trifling, and that I
might even effect them by approximation: but yet
                                                                                     be all

would   be  only preliminary,  and these   appear      me        little  to     to                      in
teresting, since we already possess several similar data which
want, more      orless, the required confidence.        shall therefore,  I
for the present, pass over the declinations          total silence. in

From the change of the daily and annual temperature, the de
gree of light, &c. &c. as well as from the reductions which must
be applied in observations, small errors may arise, which perhaps
we shall never learn how to bring into account; but which, by
a continuation                  through                                     several seasons,                     we may render of less
importance.
     If we
         deduct the mean difference of the two catalogues from
the several differences above given, the result of Mr. Pond's                                                                                                             in

    The other difference of the two catalogues (viz. that the southern
stars have, according to Mr. Pond, much less right ascension
than with me) seems to proceed from a constant error in the

works    I have had access, make no essential difference between
 some   parts  of Addition and some parts of Subtraction of Algebra.
  From an attentive consideration of the subject, I feel persuaded
 that the operations of Addition should be restricted to quantities,
 whether like or unlike, which have like signs.         That part of
 Addition which is employed in collecting quantities, whether like
 or unlike, which have unlike signs, should be classed under the
 rule for the Subtraction of simple quantities. Our authors de
 fine clearly enough that the sign + denotes Addition, and that
 the sign — denotes Subtraction; they then blend these signs,
 or blend the quantities to which these signs are prefixed, and
 sometimes call the mixture Addition, and sometimes call it Sub
 traction. Dissatisfied with this procedure, Mr. Bonnycastle re
 commends new names for these two primary rules; as if there
 were some secret charm in a name absurdly applied.        If any ob
jection    lieagainst the term Subtraction,    Mr.  Bonnycastle  sup
 poses and affirms, that objection may                      removing       be as                    by

 XIII.    On the Temperature of a Room indicatedly two Thermo

                                                 To Dr. Tilloch.
SIR,     -       ON my return
                         from the Continent in 1819, I brought
with me Breguet’s “Thermometre Métallique,”—an instrument
susceptible of the most delicate sensibility, and with which I have
made many interesting experiments.         In a still room without a
fire, in the summer months, it readily communicated the differ
ence in temperature between the floor and a chair, and this last
and the table.
      The   phaenomena    induced ine to make a series of experiments
 on the difference of temperature indicated by two thermometers
 at different altitudes, yet otherwise under similar circumstances.
     In the first series of experiments made at Nottingham from the
 21st to the 28th October last inclusive, I was surprised to find,
 that any deviation from         uniformity had  its   immediate relation           an
to   the radiation      the terrestrial temperature
                              of                          the heavens;–                  to
 indeed,     am much deceived        the difference     question
                                                       if         may not            in

   Jan. 11.—A PAPER was read “On the Theory of Astro
nomical Instruments” by B. Gompertz, Esq. wherein the author,
after stating the respective provinces of the practice and theory
in relation to the construction of astronomical instruments, pro
ceeds to divide them into two classes: viz. those constructed ac
 cording to the best rules of the art, which he proposes to call
instruments formed by direct construction; whilst others of in
 ferior merit, and whose formation is not so perfect, he proposes
 to call instruments formed by inverse construction.     The ob
ject of the paper is to examine the results which may be pro
duced by instruments of the latter kind; and to show that, pro
vided they are strong, and the parts, not intended for motion
well fixed, a proper application of theory and observation will
nevertheless enable the astronomer to obtain accurate results.
His method is illustrated by several formulae and examples.
   A notice was also communicated from Mr. Bowdich, re
specting some errors which appear to have crept into Mr. Park’s
calculations of the latitudes of several places in Africa. These
errors seem to have arisen from Mr. Park having inadvertently
reckoned on the month of April as having thirty one days; in
consequence of which            all
                             his subsequent dates were incorrect.
And when the declinations of the sun and moon were taken
from the Nautical Almanac, for the purpose       computation,             of
they were taken out for the wrong day.    Mr. Bowdich gives                               a
table of the corrected latitudes upwards   twenty places; the
                                             of                 of
differences    which vary from

 A NEW GREEN COLOUR DISCOVERED BY M. BIZIO OF VENICE.
   In repeating the beautiful experiment of Brugnatelli on the
colouring matter of coffee, I had occasion to observe some new
phaenomena.     When a drop of the infusion or decoction of
the grain fell upon a piece of cloth, it formed a yellow spot sur
rounded with a beautiful green border.        I attributed this green
colour to the oxidation of the oil of coffee.     In order to fix that
colour I boiled a hectogramme   of coffee  powder    and reduced the
decoction to eight hectogrammes. I added an equal quantity of
sulphate of copper dissolved in water, and used as a precipitate
a solution of caustic soda. A deposit was formed weighing 105
grammes, which on drying in the air took a green colour; the
more it was exposed to the air while it remained humid, the
brighter the colour became. Water, ether, alcohol and the                        al
kaline subcarbonates had no effect on the colour. Ammonia                        in
dicated the presence of copper; caustic potash changed it to
sky blue, and took itself a green colour; caustic soda did not
alter  it,

of Isis, in the Island of Philae, to Ptolomaeus Euergetus the

    According to M. Letronne, the date of this Petition must have
 been previous to the year 126 of our era. The object of his
 Memoir is to extol and explain the various peculiarities which the
 Greek text presents, to explain the customs to which several
 passages of the Petition refer, and to form from it some idea of
 the state to which the cast of Priests was reduced under the do
 mination of Ptolemy.        M. Letronne by no means joins in the
 expectations which have been conceived of the advantages of
 comparing the Greek text engraved upon the pedestal with the
 hieroglyphics on the obelisk itself.        He seems to think, both
 from the sense and the object of the Greek inscription, that, if
 the obelisk is not of a more ancient date, and afterwards re
 stored by the priests of lsis, and consequently, if the hierogly
 phics which cover it were really sculptured on this occasion,
 which seems to him the more reasonable hypothesis, these hiero
 glyphics contain, in the terms of the Greek text, a testimonial
 of the gratitude of the Priests to the Princes, and not a second
 copy, in the Sacred Language, of the Petition inscribed on the
 pedestal.
          THE LATE EXPLOSION AT CORVII.LE COLLIERY.
Extract of a letter from  Mr. H. ATKINson of Newcastle, to Mr. RIDDLE
                                                                    -
                  of the Royal Naval Asylum, Greenwich.
    “You would see in the papers an account of the dreadful ex
plosion which took place in the pit beside Mr. Buddle's, where
they have lately begun working the principal seam that lies be
tween the high and low mains.          It was not true, however, as
was stated, that Mr. Buddle himself went down immediately, he
was not there at the time it happened; it was an overman who
ventured his own life in endeavouring to save the lives of his
companions.       You may judge of the quantity of gas which is
continually escaping from the coal, from this circumstance: If a
hole of about three quarters of an inch in diameter be bored
five yards into the coal, it affords a constant supply of gas suffi
cient to keep up a flame, at the orifice, two inches in length, for
about a fortnight.       There were several such lights in the pit,
and yet the men were working with candles; although they not
only knew this, but were also aware that the discharge of gas
from the surface of the coal, wherever it had been lately ex
posed, was so great as to keep the air immediately in contact
with it almost constantly at the firing point.        The result how
ever will surely be a lesson to them not to rely upon ventilation
alone, where they have other means of safety, and where the .
danger is so great.”

  OF CUMBERLAND.
   On the 19th of February 1818, a party of gentlemen made an
excursion in the mine of Hudgilburn, to view a cavern in the
limestone rock there, discovered but a short time previous to
that date.
   At about 4 P. M. being dressed in the working habiliments of
the miners, and seated in ore waggons, two in each, vis a vis, we
were hurled along into the interior region of the mountain of
Middle Fell.
   We entered the cavern—a light was sent forward, which show
ed the direction to be in a straight line for a great distance. The
light appeared dim, and like a star peeping through a dingy
cloud.    The width varies from about three to six feet, as I
thought, but we did not then measure either the width or the
height. The roof has along                centre          its
                                                       indentation the whole an
length, and           its
                    chasm    appeared    somewhat wider            the top than              at
          at   bottom;     which,               groove        rent      the mid       or

    Advancing about half way, we came                     thin rock which    to   a                               di

                   QUADRATURE OF THE CIRCLE.
   M.    Scamarella,   a Venetian geometrician, announces in the
Gazette of Venice of 23d November, that he has solved the pro
blem of the quadrature of the circle, and that he is ready to de
monstrate it incontrovertibly to all the mathematicians in the
world. According to M. Scamarella, the superficies of a circle is
equal to the square of the proportional between the diameter of
the circle and a line equal to three-fourths of the same diameter.
It is also equal to the square of the circumference multiplied by
half the radius, estimating their ratio as 7 to 21, and not as 7 to
22, as Archimedes taught. M. Scamarella further engages to solve
 allthe most difficult problems   this nature,  offaccia qualcun      in          a

   The third is a   cage, very   large and highly   ornamented.    On
the top is a black man who beats time to the chiming of several
satyrs and two monkeys, one of whom grins quite ludicrously.
But the most wonderful things are two Canary birds that sing the
natural notes of these birds, flutter and flap their wings, and
spring from one perch to another.        In this cage is a fountain,
which falls   by several stories;   and the artificial arrangement of
pieces of glass represents so naturally the sound and glitter of
falling water, that both the eye and the ear may be deceived.
   The fourth is a park with two country seats, out of which
come two ladies, who exchange mutual salutations, and bow to
the company.      Attracted by the sudden flight and song of a bird
in a grove beside them, they turn and listen. The bird, not
larger than a bee, sings and flutters for some time, and then flies
away among the trees. Upon this, the ladies repeat their bows
and curtsies to each other and to the company, and withdraw
into their houses. On the top of the dome above, is a large but
terfly, which closes and expands                      its
                                        wings and moves       feet                          its      in

66                      Fascination    of the Snake.
                      FASCINATION OF THE SNAke.
      (From a letter signed Caroliniensis, in the New York Columbian.)
    A  friend in South Carolina, to whom I was on a visit, invited
me to a morning walk round his plantation, and recommended
our fowling-pieces as companions.             The day proved to be very
sultry; and while my friend proceeded to give some directions
to a gang of his Negroes at a distance, he advised me to take
the benefit of a shade formed by a wood adjoining the field in
which we then were. I took the hint; and while leaning on
the fence, (which was constructed on a bank between two dry
ditches,) I was alarmed by the rattle of a snake very near me.
I instantly sprung on the top rail of the fence, and the next
Imoment discovered the nonster in one of the ditches within ten
feet of the spot where I was seated.               As I levelled my gun at
his  head,   and was in the act of    pulling    the trigger, his tail ceased
to vibrate.     Conscious,    from his      position,   that I was not the
object of his regard, and that I was in no danger from him,
and confident that I could destroy him at any moment I pleased,
I sat still to observe his further movements.            As his eyes seemed
to be riveted to a particular spot, I followed their direction,
and discovered a wood-rat. At the moment of my first seeing
this little animal, he was rising from a crouching posture, and
endeavouring to retire by a retrograde movement. This attempt
was immediately followed by a second tremendous exercise of
the rattle, and the rat again sunk to the ground. I witnessed
several repetitions of this operation; and the result was, that,
 at length, the rat appeared perfectly exhausted; the snake ad
vanced towards his prey, and was in the act of taking it into his
mouth, when I discharged my two barrels at his head, and
killed him on the spot. Whether any of my pellets struck the
rat, l am unable to say; but, after the closest search, we could
 detect no mark of violence about his body, and he was dead
when I took him up,
    Some years after the foregoing circumstance had taken place,
 as I was accompanying a lady to church in a gig, we were
 alarmed by the rattle of a snake on the road side.              After I had
 tranquillized the horse, and prevailed on the lady to hold the
 reins, I returned to the spot from whence the noise seemed to
 issue, and soon discovered the subject of our alarm.             The mon
 ster was lying in a coil, ready to strike, but manifested no con
 cern at my approach.        Having armed myself with a long fence
 rail, I was in the act of crushing his head, when I saw a rabbit
 in the very same posture and condition which the rat had ex
 hibited.—The fall of my weapon disabled the snake, and I
                                                                         º 1S*

 from the snake         or

   Captain Vetch and Mr. Drummond, the engineer officers            in
trusted with the conduct of the Trigonometrical Survey in the
North of Scotland, have finished their task in Orkney and Zet
land, by establishing in those clusters of islands the several posi
tions which serve to connect them with the main land of Scot
land.   In their operations they were attended by the Protector
gun-brig, Captain Hewet commander; and that gentleman was
employed at the same time in a nautical survey of various har
bours among those islands, which stood in need, particularly in
Zetland, of more accurate charts than have yet been given to
mariners.    The laborious and hazardous task has been brought
to a conclusion, with one loss; Mr. Fitzjames, midshipman, and
four men, having gone from the rendezvous at Calfsound in Eda,
to the island of Sanda for some provisions, were lost on their re
turn, in one of those fearful currents of tide (the Lashy roast),
which are frequent among those islands.

   SIR,-With     my last register of 1820, I mentioned that less
 rain had fallen that year than for several preceding, and that a
 want of water had been felt both by mills and canals.      A similar
 observation will not be  applicable to the  year past,  for the re
gister now sent shows a very great excess to the quantity of
 London and             its
                  neighbourhood, beyond many former years. The
evaporation has been rather less than the average       the last four               of
years.      may
             It       worthy      be
                                 remark, that the rainy and most
                                              of
 tempestuous weather                    in
                           the two last months has been         wide                       of
extent, and that the great storm about Christmas, when the ba
rometer was      low    so             as
                         28-07 (say twenty-eight inches and seven
hundredths), was very disastrous both here and         the Mediter              in
ranean, and that earthquakes occurred           Bavaria and other     in
places.           As
              the different heights    rain gauges above the con
                                                     of
tiguous ground                    on
                      which they are placed, has     material effect          a

on the quantity of rain caught, it would be well if every person fa
vouring the public with their observations would with every re
gister mention the height at which their instruments were placed
above the ground.     I remain, sir, your obedient servant,
   To Dr. Tilloch.                            HENRY L.Awson.

                                                      three inches.
On the 29th, the Barometer again fell         27-73, after whichto                                     it
rose rapidly.    From the 16th                to
                                       the 31st      never attained         it
29:00, though the changes               its

                                   in

76                    Barometric Observations.
 degree above that of the preceding year, and is owing to the
 mildness of the autumnal and winter months, fully compensated
 for the decrease from the usual averages experienced in May,
 June, and July, which were the only months below the means of
 the corresponding periods in 1820.
    Wind.—The prevailing winds are again S.W. and W. The
North and Southerly ones are nearly equal, and the N.W. and
S.E. exactly so. The strongest winds have blown from the
 South, and particularly towards the close of the year.
    Rain.—The amount of rain, which has annually and gradually
decreased since the wet year 1816, is less than that of the pre
ceding one, though the two last months have nearly brought up
the usual average.     If the rain be taken from the last quarter of
the  moon,  commencing     the 16th ult. up to the same time of the
present period (the 15th), the total amount exceeds six inches
and a half, a most unusual quantity for these parts.

    DEAR SIR,-Having sent the calculated results of the ob
servations on the Barometer in my last, up to November, and
having completed the year 1821, as to the monthly observations,
I consider it due to yourself and correspondents to acknowledge
the obligation I feel for the attention shown to the subject pro
posed by me; and to assure you that I shall feel great pleasure,
at some future period, in renewing the course under some im
provements, and hope to be able to                the zero    fix permanent      by   a
mark,                    or               places      London;    whence,                              by

state of ebullition, by carbonate of ammonia.       The whole of the
iron to the last  atom,   is precipitated, and the whole of the other
metals present (which I suppose to be manganese, cerium, nickel,

and cobalt) remain in solution.
   The precautions necessary to ensure success in this process are
few and simple.      In the first place, the solution must contain no
oxide of manganese or cerium above the first degree of oxidation,
otherwise it will be separated with the iron.        It is scarcely pro
bable in   ordinary   cases that   any  such should be present, the
protoxides only of these metals forming salts of any stability;
but should they be suspected, a short ebullition with a little sugar
will reduce them to the minimum.          If nitric acid be now added,
the iron alone is peroxidized, the other oxides remaining at the
minimum *. Moreover, in performing the precipitation the me
tallic solution should not be too concentrated, and must be agi
tated the whole time, especially towards the end of the process;
and when the acid reaction is so far diminished that log-wood
paper is but feebly affected by         the alkaline solution must  it,                                                       be

    The precipitation of iron above described seems at first sight
to result from a double decomposition.         Were it so, the princi
ple of the method would be merely a difference of solubility in
the carbonates of iron and the other metals, and as such would
have no claim to be regarded as rigorous.         Such however is not
the case.    The iron is not separated in the state of a carbonate,
but of a sub-salt, or a simple peroxide, the whole of the carbonic
acid escaping with effervescence at each addition of the alkali.
The phaenomenon turns on a peculiarity in the peroxide of this
metal, in virtue of which it is incapable of existing in a neutral
solution at the boiling temperature.          If we add an alkaline,
earthy, or metallic carbonate by little and little to a cold solution
of peroxide of iron, the precipitate formed is redissolved with
effervescence, readily at first, but gradually more and more slowly,
till at length many hours, or even days, elapse before the liquid
becomes quite clear.     Meanwhile it deepens in colour till (unless
much diluted) it becomes dark brown or red.      If the addition of
the carbonate be carried as far as possible without producing a
permanent precipitate, the solution is perfectly neutral, and con
tinues clear at a low temperature for any length of time.   In this
state it may be evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and the residue
 (which does not effervesce with acids) is still soluble in water
without letting any iron fall, and so on as often as we please.
   The compound thus formed is however far from permanent.
It is in fact in a state of tottering equilibrium, which a very
slight cause is sufficient to overset. Supposing the point of sa
turation to have been exactly attained, the addition of an ex
tremely small quantity more of the alkaline solution is sufficient
to determine the separation of the whole, or nearly the whole,
metallic contents; and if the solution operated on be pretty con
centrated, it fixes after a longer or shorter time into a stiff and
almost solid coagulum.     Again, if to the coagulum so formed, a
quantity equally inappreciable of the original ferruginous solution
be added, it gradually liquefies, and after some time is com
pletely redissolved (forming no inapt representation of the cele
brated imposture of St. Januarius's blood)*.
    * The phaenomenon described in the text appears to me to differ from or
 dinary precipitations and solutions, in the small proportion between the
precipitant and the precipitate, the solvent and the matter dissolved. I
 can call to mind but one instance of so small a quantity of matter operating
a chemical change on so large a mass, viz. the decomposition of oxygenated
water by fibrin and other animal substances.     The action seems to be pro
pagated from particle to particle.     Whether the superabundant oxide of
                                         all
iron be retained in solution in a state at   analogous   tothatof the oxygen
in  Thenard's experiments, might possibly deserve consideration.

 XXIII.    Letter from Robert HARE, M.D. Professor of Chemi
    stry in the University of Pennsylvania, &c. &c. to the Editor
    of the American Journal of Science and Arts, in Opposition
    to the Conjecture that Heat may be Motion, and in favour of
    the Existence of a material Cause of calorific Repulsion *.
 DEAR        Sin-Is two        memoirs published in your Journal, I have
  endeavoured to show that caloric and electricity are collateral
  agents in galvanism, the ratio of the former to the latter, in
  quantity, being as the extent of the operating superficies to the
  number of pairs into which it may be divided.                  In those publi
  cations,         I
                assumed that the causes of heat and electricity are
  material fluids.      Although this view of the origin of calorific re
  pulsion is taken by a great majority of chemists, it has been com
  bated, both by Rumford and Davy: the former famous for his
  ingenious, instructive and laborious experiments; and the latter
  distinguished by the most splendid discoveries.              With the utmost
  deference for the authority of these great men, especially the lat
  ter, I send the following remarks made in answer to his hypo
                                                                                                                     *
  thetical views, which I shall here quote from his Elements      -        in order
  to introduce the subject more intelligibly.

can be no motion without matter.             To surmount this difficulty,
he calls up a suggestion of Newton's, that the calorific vibrations
of matter may send off radiant particles, which lose their own
momentum in communicating vibrations to bodies remote from
those whence they emanate. Thus, according to Sir Humphry,
there is radiant matter producing heat, and radiant matter pro
ducing light.       Now, the only serious objection made by him to
the doctrine which considers heat as material, will apply equally
against the existence of material calorific emanations.              That the
cannon, heated by friction in the noted experiment of Rumford,
would have radiated as well as if heated in any other way, there
can, I think, be no doubt; and as well in vacuo, as the heat ex
cited by Sir Humphry in a similar situation.              That        emission                its

lar breeding fish with special sexual organs.   It is therefore more
than   probable  that the conger  is the breeding  eel, and that it
never returns into fresh water after its entrance into the ocean.
This peculiarity is different from the salmon, which alternates                                                  its
periodical visits between the rivers and sea for breeding pur
poses: but Nature observes general, and not universal rules.

   Any person resident        the coast might easily determine the

  ference.     I ordered a continuance under the same directions,
  and in two days more the urine was of nearly the natural colour;
  but the skin had not improved in the same proportion.             I ad
  vised tonics with the occasional use of the     acid,   and  my patient
  shortly recovered.
      I have had many of the same complaint since that time, and
  have directed nearly in the manner, according to the age and
  çondition of the patients, and the result has been the restoration
  of health in a very short time. In general, the yellowness dis
  appeared in three or four days from the urine, but continued a
  little longer on the skin; by the use of tonics, and sometimes a
  little of the acid, this is however removed in a few days. I have
  met with only one patient, whose symptoms have not yielded to
  the above plan.      This was a person eighty years of age. Even
  in this case, however, the acid always produced relief; but the
  complaint soon returned.        My present practice is to give a ca
  thartic of calomel and julep or some of the neutral salts, and
  then the balm tea moderately acidulated with the phosphoric
  acid, which I direct   to have continued till it operates as a diuretic
 and until the urine      becomes clear or nearly so; this commonly
  takes place in the     course of two days. I have advised other
  acids when this has    not been at hand; but I am inclined to give
 the preference to the phosphoric, although          I  think the others
  deserve a further trial.
      I might have entered much more into detail, but I am satis
 fied that it needs only a trial to convince any candid person of
 the advantage of this acid in the cure of the jaundice. I have
 never seen any bad effects from the use of the phosphoric acid,
 although it is said that phosphorus is poisonous.            This I have
 never used.
      I shall be happy to answer any inquiries, and remain respect
 fully your obedient servant,

 SiR, -—     Is  No. 284, page 433, of the “Philosophical Magazine
 and Journal,” we are favoured with “Thoughts on the Cultiva
 tion of Maize, &c. by a practical and experimental Farmer.” It
 is indeed an inquiry of considerable interest. That Indian corn
 has ripened in this country, and that too without artificial warmth
 or shelter, is  a well ascertained fact, and such seeds would     doubt
-less ensure a succession more hardy than the primitive             seed,

whence the successional crops, were derived.                  An intelligent
 practical farmer in Holderness informed me he had succeeded
 in rearing Indian corn in an unsheltered and exposed situation,
 and that the seed thus obtained grew freely.               In the North of
 Italy, the growers of maize twitch off the tops of the plants as
soon as the male flowers have done their part, and this is allowed
to accelerate the expansion and ripening of the seeds.
    In the Neapolitan kingdom they possess a species or variety
of the Indian corn, called Mellica quarantina, which is sown
as a successional crop after the wheats are reaped.                 It is pre
sumed    ripe   for the sickle in   forty  days,  and from this circum
stance receives              its
                          specific distinction.    This variety          maize                            of
seems   admirably     adapted                   for

lead, precisely in proportion to that high degree of estimation in
which his writings are held. All Mr. Bonnycastle's three cases,
in Addition, exhibit a mixture of positive with negative quantities.                                                         "
Now, this mixture is contrary to the nature of Addition, for                                                        its
operations should       limited     quantities (whether like

                                greatly simplified, and rendered con
sistent.   When    positive  and negative quantities are opposed                                                    to

deduced, and conclusive with respect to the opinion I have pre
sumed to maintain.

   This last is a fine experiment; and if properly managed, the
splinter of wood or other material may be withdrawn from the
flame, the central part untouched.
   In reference to aphlogistic phaenomena in the article                                       “CoM
Bustion,” in Dr. Ure's Nicholson's Dictionary of Chemistry, the
following occurs: “Platinum and palladium, metals of low con
ducting powers and small capacities for heat, alone succeed in
producing these phaenomena.”            Now I am confident Sir H. Davy
would not wish a compliment paid to him at the expense of truth,
and on these terms I am also certain Dr. Ure would not deire to
bestow       it.
               Sir       H.
                      Davy not finding other metals            succeed           “                          in

his own tables.
   To be brief: The error of your correspondent        has arisen from
his  supposing  the increase or decrease of the differences to be re
gular, and calculating accordingly.       If instead of taking a mean
proportional part of the difference, he will find the true diffe
rence, by interpolation; for Dec. 14. 56 he will get 0,026, which
subtracted from +0.273, gives +0.247, the very same M. Bes

XXXIII.       Account              of    an   improved         Method         of   planting           Vines

I  have the charge.
    My compost was formed          follows:       as

ness   to the compost, thereby allowing the water            pass freely             to
through        it.
                At the same time        collected some lime rubbish,
                                                       I

and   a quantity     the richest old dung

   These materials having been kept separate, and frequently
turned over   the summer, were mixed together
                     in                          the autumn                         in

                           of planting             Vines      for Forcing.                                125
of 1818, in the following proportions: one-half of loam, one
fourth of dung, and one-fourth of lime rubbish, united with the
tan and leaf-mould.  They were well mixed, by frequent turnings
(but were not sifted) during the winter, when the weather was
frosty or dry, for this operation should never be performed in
wet weather.                                                -
   It may be noticed, that I did not use so much dung in m
compost as is sometimes done; for I have observed that an ex
cess of it retards the growth of the vine, notwithstanding it is
considered to be a plant which will bear an extraordinary quan
tity of manure. The addition of old tan to the compost, which
is not usual, I recommend, because l know, from experience,
that the vines will root in that more freely than in any other
substance.
   In March last, the border, in front of the vinery, was cleared
to the depth of upwards of three feet, below which it was drained,
and then filled up with the new compost to the level of the bot
tom plate of the house; this was done in fine weather, and the
new mould had full two months time to settle well before the
young vines were planted in                        it.
   My vine plants were raised from single eyes             March 1818;               in
they were treated       the usual way through the summer, and kept
                           in
from the frost during winter, until March last, when they were
cut down         one eye, and placed
                 to                         the pine-pit    order
                                                             in     pro               in             to

the time        planting.

feet long, they were removed             the green-house (which was

Acid chromate        of potash is anhydrous: I obtained it by                                      di

the greater the variation.     In general, the refraction when vari
able is greatest near sun-rise and sun-set, and least during the

perceptible, a very sudden increase of refraction of 10" or 20"
will be remarked on an evening within a short time of sun-set.

coloured matter is separated, leaving the remaining fluid entirely
tasteless and colourless.    This precipitate was diffused through
water, and decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen; it afforded a
solution of tan and extract, but not any traces of any peculiar

green tea, could be attributed.”

fusions of tea, belonging especially to black and green, which
seems to announce the presence of a distinct vegetable principle;
namely, that they deposit, as they cool, a brown pulverulent
precipitate, which passes through ordinary filters, and can only
he collected by deposition and decantation; this precipitate is
very slightly soluble in cold water of the temperature of from 50°
downwards, but it dissolves with the utmost facility in water of
 100° and upwards, forming a pale-brown transparent liquid, which
furnished abundant precipitate in solutions of isinglass, of sul
phate of iron, of muriate of tin, and of acetate of lead; whence
it may be inferred to consist of tannin,

                     PRESERVING           objects of NATURAL history.
    M. Drapier, Professor of Chemistry and Natural History,andone
 of the Editors of the Annales Generales des Sciences Physiques,”
 has substituted with success, in lieu of the poisonous matters
 employed in preserving objects of natural history, a soap com
 posed of potash and fish oil.      He dissolves one part of caustic
 potash in water, and adds to the solution one part of fish oil: he
 rubs the mixture till it acquires a pretty firm consistence.   When
 it is completely dry, he reduces it to powder with a rasp. One
 part of this powder is employed in forming a soft paste or liquid
'soap, by means of an equal quantity of a solution of camphor in
 musked alcohol.     This liquid soap is well rubbed upon the skin
 of the bird, previously cleared of     fat, and the other part   its
                                                                  the                                             of

                                               Hartwell, February   19, 1822,
   SIR,-There     are some circumstances so remarkable in the pre
sent season, that I have deemed them worthy of being noted down
in your magazine, with a view that they may be compared with
the observations of meteorologists in different parts of the coun
try. That the winter has been very unusually mild, and that
there has been a considerable proportion of wet and blowing
weather, must have struck every body; but on a minute inspec
tion of the instruments of meteorology, I find peculiarities which
are less obvious to common observation. In four days out of seven
(on an average) in every week since the lst of last December,
the temperature has risen more than three degrees between nine
o'clock at night and midnight; there has been a constant fluc
tuation of temperature, as well as of barometrical pressure,    the      all
winter, with the exception    ofafew weeks     late; but the above
                                                  of
circumstance seems    toshow that the changes from       lower
                                                            a              to  a
higher temperature have usually taken place between nine o'clock
and midnight; for   ifthe weather had not changed        that time,
                                                            at
the heat would have gone      ondeclining through the night,                   as
                                                                of
usual. Should any       your correspondents       be
                   of of                         desirous          can
                                                                it,  I
send   you minutes     the observations taken from    my  journal.  Of
the cause  of  the above phenomena   I    am ignorant; but       elec
                                                                    if
tricity  be principally concerned     in   producing atmospherical
changes,  its irregular distribution this season (which several other
circumstances indicate) may perhaps account for the unusual

periods of the changes of temperature.        The perpetual changes
of the weather, accompanied with showers of rain in December
and January, have induced a false belief that a real greater quantity
of rain has fallen this season than is usual, which some astrologers
have not been backward hastily to attribute to the conjunction of
Jupiter and Saturn. In fact, there has been no very great                                      in
crease in the quantity of rain fallen this winter.    The extraordi
mary depression of the quicksilver in the barometer is another re
markable circumstance, as it has occurred more than once during
the present season.  On the night of the 24th December at eight
o'clock it was as low as 27.97°, the thermometer being 46" of
Fahrenheit. By twelve o’clock the barometer had risen about, ºr
of an inch, and the thermometer had risen to 48"; and the wind,
which was high, became stormy, and blew in violent gales inter
cepted by calms, and accompanied by torrents of rain.
   The most violent gale we have had this year, took place at five
in the morning of the 23d December; it blew tremendously for
above an hour, and was followed by a dead calm ; but the wind
got up again and blew very cold.       After sun-rise on the 25th, I
have noticed that previously to                   all
                                    the heavy gales that have blown
of  late, there has been             an
                             elevation     temperature.     of
   We have had but three     frosty nights  this year; but my house

156                      Meteorological Results.
   The annual mean temperature of the past year is fifty-one de
grees; being about two degrees above the average : the mean of
the first three months, 40°9; second 54°l ; third, 61°9; fourth,
48"; of the six winter months, 44°4; six summer months, 57°9.
The maximum, or hottest state of the year was 81°, which oc
curred on the memorable 19th of July, the Coronation of King
George the Fourth ; the minimum or coldest state was 23°, which
is only 9 below freezing; this happened on the 4th January,
making an annual variation of 58°. From the above, the reporter
is enabled to draw the following comparison between the past
and preceding year, viz. the average heat of the six summer
months of 1821 was nearly one degree more than that of 1820,
and the heat of the six winter months three degrees above the
corresponding ones of the preceding year; so that the temperature
of 1821 has been more mild than  - usual, and not marked by any
very great extremes.
   The annual mean elevation of the barometer is nearly twenty
nine inches and seven-tenths; highest 30-65, which was on the
23rd of January; lowest 28:16, which happened on the 28th of
December: the difference of these extremes makes 2:49 inches :
mean of the six summer months 29-75; of the six winter months
29.63. The mean daily movements of the barometrical surface
measure nearly forty-eight inches: total number of changes one
hundred and five. The barometer throughout the month of
February was remarkably high and desultory in         movements:           its

down 180 days on which rain fell more or less, which number is
one less than last year. In the last five months of 1820 there
were 85 wet days; the number in the corresponding ones of 1821
is 101. February was the dryest, and September and Novem
ber the wettest.
  The south, south-west,               and west winds have been the most
prevalent: those winds were noticed to blow on 224 days. On
the 18th, 19th, and 20th of March, (about the vernal equinox)
the wind blew hurricanes from the north-west, attended with
rain, snow, and sleet.    On the night of the 30th of November
and following morming, the wind blew a most violent gale from
the south-west accompanied with hail and rain; the damage
done in consequence, by the falling of chimneys, unroofing of
houses, &c. was great; several lives were lost in Liverpool and
other places, and a large number of vessels suffered in the harbours
and on the neighbouring coasts.

XXXVI.       On the Theory   of parallel Lines in         Geometry.       By
                      JAMEs Ivory, M.A. F. R.S.,
IN    laying down the elements of mathematical science, great dif
ficulties occur at the outset.    In arithmetic we are immediately
embarrassed with the doctrine of incommensurable quantities.
In geometry, the manner of treating the subject of parallel lines
is a blemish which the efforts of ancient and modern mathema
ticians have equally failed to remove. In the same science some
obscurity and even mistakes prevailed with respect to the equa
lity of solid figures, till accuracy and precision were introduced
by the publication of Legendre's Elements, one of the ablest and
most original works that has appeared in modern times. The
comparison of the pyramid with the prism must also have occa
sioned some perplexity to the first authors who wrote on geo
metry.      In advancing further, new difficulties occur at every
step; as when we would compare the lengths of curve and
straight lines; or when we would determine the proportion be
tween curve and plane surfaces.
    In algebra some obscurity has arisen from what are called ne
gative quantities.     But it would be very inaccurate to assimilate
the    seeming  paradoxes     and apparent contradictions that arise
from the doctrine of      negative    quantities in algebra to the real
difficulties that are met with in geometry.           The latter are un
avoidable, and inherent in the subject: the former originate from
inaccurate phraseology, and the crude and unphilosophical man
ner of treating the elements of a branch of science comparatively
new, and that, in no great space of time, has been almost im
measurably extended.          There can be no better argument for
the truth of what is here advanced, than to observe that the ab
surdities attending the use of the negative sign appear only in
general discussions, and when the quantities affected with it are:
considered abstractly.       It is only on such occasions that we hear
of quantities less than nothing ; or that negative quantities are
compared to debts, while positive quantities signify real posses
sions.     These exceptionable modes of speaking are never intro
duced in the solution of particular problems.           In such cases     all
the relations  of  the quantities considered are distinctly compre
hended, and the algebraist readily accomplishes his purpose                by
means   of  addition, and the      noless clear operation   of subtracting:
a  less from a  greater  quantity.        It   with these clear notions,
                                               is
that the    mind,   inevery    investigation,   sets out; and the diffi
culty consists   in reconciling them with the generalizations not
only permitted but required         by the genius     algebra.

   Some mathematicians of this country, founding their objec
tions chiefly on verbal inaccuracies, contend that the doctrine
of negative quantities should be banished from algebra.      With
out stopping to inquire into the cause of the obscurities of which
they complain, these purists will give no quarter to any thing
that has even the appearance of infringing the clearness and
evidence which is the boast of mathematical science.          They
rather choose to obviate the difficulties they meet with, by
breaking down every proposition into        particular cases, than,  its
by following the spirit    the algebraic  analysis,

they would neglect the distinction between the two sciences, and
would cramp the former        the restrictionsby    which the latter        to                               is

    But, to return to geometry, it may be worth while to inquire,
 what has been the conduct of the ancients in regard to the dif
 ficulties that present themselves in that science. They have
 either overcome the obstacles that obstructed their progress; or,
 when this was impossible, they have fairly laid down what they
 could not demonstrate as principles to be assented to by their
 disciples in the further prosecution of their researches.         Of
 the first of these ways of proceeding we have instances in the
investigations relating to incommensurable quantities, and to the
proportion between the pyramid and the prism.          In both these
 cases too the ancient geometers have succeeded by the same
 means, namely, by employing the indirect mode of investi
 gation.
    Archimedes furnishes an example of the other way of pro
 ceeding in the principles prefixed to his treatise on the Sphere
 and Cylinder. These principles, on which are founded the most
 considerable of his discoveries in pure mathematics, are really
 theorems which ought to be demonstrated, but which the an
 cient geometry affords no means of proving.       Another instance
 of the same kind we have in Euclid's manner of treating parallel
 lines.    That geometer has demonstrated, in the 17th of the first
 book, that any two angles of a triangle are together less than
 two right angles. The plan of his work required that the con
 verse of the same proposition should be proved; and it is the
 want of this proof, which no geometer has been able to invent,
 that constitutes the difficulty in the theory of parallel lines."
 Euclid has therefore, in the 12th Axiom, laid down, as a princi
 ple to which the assent is demanded, the proposition of which
 no demonstration can be found.         It is no doubt inaccurate to
 class a principle of this kind with the axioms to which it has no
 affinity; but this is an objection of no moment, when the inten
                                                                    --
 tion of the author is understood.            -
    Many attempts     have  been  made by succeeding geometers to
 remove the defect found in Euclid's doctrine of parallel lines.
  New definitions of the straight line have heen imagined; and
 new axioms, or rather new principles of reasoning, have been
 proposed; but none of these expedients have been attended with
 complete success.     On a deliberate view of the case the prefer
 ence must, I think, be given to Euclid's manner of treating the
 subject; because it places before the student without disguise
 the true nature and origin of the difficulty.
                                                            -
    Legendre, in the first nine editions of his Geometry, has treated
 parallel lines in a manner that is both new and seems to be more

intimately connected with the real cause of the difficulty than
 any other hitherto proposed.      The foundation of it is to
                                                                lilde

independently of the theory of parallels, that the three angles of
a triangle are together equal to two right angles. This is ac
complished by proving indirectly that the angles of a triangle
can neither be less nor greater than two right angles. And,
when we reflect that the whole difficulty is occasioned by the im
perfect nature of the definition of a straight line, we are led to
suspect that it is necessary to employ the indirect mode of rea
soning.     One objection may be made to Legendre's demonstra
tion; for we are required to admit that, through a point situated
within a rectilineal angle, at least one straight line may be drawn
 that shall meet both the sides of the angle; a hypothesis, which,
 although it be very probable, is yet in some degree uncertain
and precarious.     Thinking to gratify the lovers of speculative
geometry, I shall now add a demonstration of the same proposi
tion, which requires no new principles, and is liable to no ob
jection excepting the length that always attends indirect investi

of platinum     thus obtained, is to be reduced by strong calcination
in a   crucible,  observing the precautions already indicated.              The
pure platinum remains in the crucible, under the form of a greyish
coloured spongy mass, which acquires metallic lustre by friction
against any hard body.
    17. As platinum can be fused only in small masses at a time,
and at a flame supplied with oxygen gas, or the compound flame
of oxygen and hydrogen, it cannot be melted on the large scale
like most others.        However, chemists have succeeded in forming
this metal into ingots of a very considerable weight, by uniting
the particles with strong pressure at a very high temperature.
For this purpose, a certain quantity of platinum, resulting from
the calcination of the triple ammoniacal salt, is compressed in
a crucible; them more is successively introduced, even to the
 amount of 20 or 30 pounds.             The crucible is then covered, and
heated to whiteness. The platinum is now transferred as speedily
 as possible into a square steel matrix (a strong hoop of steel,
jointed, would answer equally well) and capable of opening into
two pieces by means of hinges. On the top of the ignited mass,
 a steel mandril, adapted to the cavity of the matrix, is to be ap
 plied, which is to be rapidly driven home, by three or four blows
 of a strong coining screw-press.              By this powerful pressure,
 which the    spongy    platinum     experiences    at a white heat, it                          di
 minishes greatly in bulk, and                 its
                                         particles already acquire        pretty       a
 strong cohesion.        The matrix           collar or   opened, the mass                        of

diately there is formed, in the liquid, a precipitate in the shape
of small needles, delicate and shining, possessing a beautiful pale
rose-colour. This crystalline precipitate is an ammonio-sub
protomuriate    of palladium. Since this salt is insoluble, there can
remain none of it in the liquid.         It may be separated by the
filter, and washed with very cold water. By heating this salt to
redness in a crucible, the palladium remains pure.          It may be
afterwards melted in a     cavity   of ignited charcoal,  on which a
stream of oxygen gas is made to play.                               -
    20. The liquid freed from the salt of palladium, possesses a
fine currant-red colour, derived from the ammonio-muriate of
rhodium, which it holds in solution, and which is very soluble.
 It contains, moreover, a little muriate of iron, and occasionally
 a little muriate of copper, when this metal has not been entirely
 dissolved by the first portion of nitro-muriatic acid, which was
 made to act on the ore, as has been stated above. There are
 two modes of treating this salt, to obtain pure rhodium.          The
 first consists in evaporating this liquid, at a gentle heat, to dry
 ness; and boiling the residuum several times along with abso
 lute alcohol. The spirit dissolves          the muriate    all
                                                              iron and           of
 copper, with the excess               of
                               sal-ammoniac, and does not affect the
 ammonio-muriate          rhodium, which remains

 saline powder            in of
                        fine carmine-red colour.    By calcining this
salt  to redness

                       crucible, we decompose                        it,
                                                       and the rhodium
remains pure and perfectly metallic.          The second means       ob                       of
taining the rhodium from the above liquid, consists             plunging         in
into  it plates    iron. The rhodium and the copper are precipi
                    of

example does not fall under the rule of subtraction; and hence
the operations of algebraic addition cannot be “restricted” to
quantities of like signs; neither can the operations of algebraic
subtraction be so “restricted:” hence a mixture of operations must
inevitably take place under each rule: and hence it is fairly                                           in
ferred, that the terms addition and subtraction are not sufficiently
comprehensive in meaning to denote that mixture                                          of operations
coming under each of these rules.

The solution was more difficult than with pure platina. No trace
ofcarbonaceous residue appeared during solution; but,       pro                                        as   it

dissolved: this was evaporated, and the dry salt redissolved in
water, leaving a white powder behind.
   This powder was then heated in a silver crucible with three
parts of potash, in which it readily melted, and the alkaline mass
easily and totally dissolved in water, with the exeeption of some
minute fragments of platina separable by the filter.       Sulphuric
acid poured into the filtered fluid gave a white gelatinous preci
pitate, which was evidently silex.    It is probable, therefore, that
the wood-charcoal (which yields by combustion 2 or 3 per cent.
of ash, chiefly siliceous) furnishes the silex that unites with the
platina during the cementation, probably in the form of silicium,

190                    Account of the Levelling taken from
immersed, and which easily dissolves the oxide of iron formed
by the decomposition of the silex, thereby facilitating the reduc
tion. Whereas, when the iron is fused by itself, the silex can
only be furnished by the crucible, to which it coheres with con
siderable force; and the oxide of iron, as it forms, soaks into
the crucible, and serves to protect the earth from the contact of
the metal; which is doubtless the cause why the conversion into
steel cannot be completed without the presence of a glass.
   We cannot, therefore, judge of the degree of heat required for
the fusion of iron in a Hessian crucible, since it appears demon
strated that at a very high heat iron reduces silex, and combines
with the silicium thus produced into a compound more fusible
than iron per           se.

curvature, being opposed to each other in quantities nearly equal,
need not enter into the calculation.
    In a second attempt to find the fall, the distances when even
slopes presented themselves were sometimes as much as 2000
feet, and little attention was paid to the placing of the theodo
lite precisely at the medium distance.
   The route adopted is upwards of four miles; yet the aggregate
fall to various places, as determined by the two methods, rarely
differed more than a foot.        The mean gave 976 feet for the
total perpendicular descent.
    Finally, A third or verification levelling was effected in nearly
a direct line to the canal.    The distances were repeatedly mea
sured with   tapes of different lengths, and the angles were taken
with the horizon-sector.                             The last distance was found trigono
metrieally from two bases,                           all

   At Rumbles Moor and at the Observatory the principal angles
were measured with a twelve-inch repeating circle of a peculiar
construction, but not calculated to take vertical angles. . The
telescope, two feet in length, and furnished with cylindrical rings
of equal diameter, and an excellent spirit-level, rcsts (in a pair
of Ys) exactly over the upper part of the axis of the instrument,
and serves to render the line of vision parallel to the plane of
the divided circle.    By fitting the telescope into an axis working
in the Ys the angles can also be taken in azimuth, but what is
gained in expedition and exemption from subsequent calculations
is lost in point of accuracy.      Frequent use of the instrument
produces a shake in the centre, which renders the repeating pro
                                           -
perty nearly worthless.
    At Alfred Castle an eight-inch circle reading off to 15", and
fitted up as a transit with a low axis, and a fifteen-inch telescope,
was made use of.        One wire with a mark in the middle was
found preferable to two.
    At the other stations, viz. Symon Seat, Beamsley Rock, Carn
cliffe, Ilkley Wells, Chevin Beacon, the Bow, Eccles-hill Wind
mill, East Ardsley Church, Whitchurch, Jack-hill and Great
Almias Cliff, the angles were measured by the four-inch theodo
lite. The divisions on silver read off to                  l'.

poured in to the height of about one inch, the image floated at
the surface. I now covered the tumbler up to this surface with
black cloth, and desired an assistant to throw in different coins,
while     I
          kept my eyes shut, each of which I described on again
opening my eyes, by looking at their images floating on the sur
face of the water an inch above the coins, my eye being on a line
with that surface, as thus represented: a b a tumbler filled to the
height of one inch with clear water, and covered with black
cloth; c a half-crown placed at the bottom; d the reflected
image immediately over the coin, and seen by an eye at e.
   Now, sir, I would beg leave to ask any person, not entirely
blinded by prejudice, Is there not a reflected image formed perpen
dicularly over the piece of money, capable of being seen by an eye
above, below, and on a line with the surface? Query, Does this
reflected image send rays, or rather, an image, to the spectator's
eye 2 To see is to believe *. But, sir, in your last Journal there
is something about the analogy between reflection and refraction:
however, as no particular objections are brought against my opi
nions, I must think it a waste of time to answer vague and angry
generalities. I am well aware, that my opinions on vision, light,
and colours, are diametrically opposite to those of the schools,
and entertain too high a respect for their professors not to believe
that they will undergo a liberal and unprejudiced examination.
If the gentleman be really serious in denying the evidence of his
senses, he must come to particulars.
   Now let us examine this experiment according to the received
laws laid down in every elementary treatise on optics; and I con
tend that no refraction or bending of the rays can possibly take
place at d, for the rays ca enter the air perpendicular to the plane
surface of the water; consequently they must pass on without
any refraction.    Mr. Harris has a figure (see fig. 8.) illustrating
refraction at plane surfaces. Suppose the vessel empty, BK                                                        its

a refracted image we see, is evident from our being able to see it
in every direction floating on the surface of the water : if re
fracted, we could only see it in the direction of the refracted rays.
When the eye is placed immediately over the half-crown, looking
down into the water, we see the image, not the piece of money,
one-fourth nearer to the eye: here there can be no refraction, as
the rays coming to the eye must be at right angles to the surface
of the water: here there is no angle of incidence; no angle of
refraction; no ratio of 3 to 4. In fact, this simple experiment

to the present theory, two images could not possibly be formed by
refraction at b and  f;  for a being at right angles to the plane d c,
the rays should suffer no refraction, but proceed on to the vertex.
The very same mistake which induced optical writers to suppose
from analogy that rays converged in the body of a convex lens,
made them also suppose that rays were turned in the body of a
prism to the thickest part as well within as without the medium.
Let us now examine this experiment according to the present laws
of optics.                                                           -
    Let the angle CA I (fig. 11) be a right angle; then the whole
refraction is at C; and in this case, D C A : A C D :: m : m—n.
Also, since the right angle D C I is equal to the sum of the two
A C I, 'A I C, take away the common angle AC I, and the re
maining angles D C A,       AI  C are equal. Consequently        AIC
: A C I : ; m: m— n. Now I would beg leave to ask, Does any
light in this experiment pass through the plane Y Z * The ray
Q A is undoubtedly turned to the thickest part of the prism; not,
as Newton and his followers suppose, from any principle of at
traction, but simply because it strikes the plane      IZ   obliquely,
and there forms an     image,   which moves downwards.          Let us
vary this experiment.     I placed the plane of the prism on a small
hole, cut in a large sheet of pasteboard, and perceived two images
of the hole formed in the planes, as already described with the
sovereign.    I now removed this sheet of pasteboard with the
prism into the sun-beams, as represented (see fig. 12), and
found that the rays passed through both planes S. The sun
passes through a hole in the pasteboard, and, striking the plane
A B perpendicularly, forms an image at d, which image sends
                                f
rays to form other images at and g.         Here we have two spec
tra at f  and g, the one ascending the other descending in conse
quence of striking the planes obliquely.     In this experiment op
ticians are necessarily obliged to relinquish one of their favourite
laws, “that rays striking at right angles to plane surfaces suffer
no refraction; for it cannot possibly be denied, 1st, that the rays
strike the plane A B at right angles; and 2dly, that the rays       di
verge: otherwise they could not come through the planes AC and
BC. Are the rays refracted in opposite directions? or are they
attracted and repelled in opposite directions        But if we admit
that an image is formed at d, we can easily account for the two
reflections at f  and g.    Had Sir Isaac Newton been acquainted
with the formation of two spectra (and I cannot but express sur
prise that he was not), he never could have maintained the doc
trines he did.    Here I cannot but notice a curious fact in regard
to the prism, although not immediately connected with the doc
trime of refraction.  When the sun-beams are passed through the
lower refracting angle, as it is called, on emergence they ascend
                                C C 2                              and

and form a beautiful spectrum on the opposite wall, orange at
the bottom, violet at the top, with intermediate colours : but on
looking through the same refracting angle at the hole in the
pasteboard or window-shutter, the experimenter is surprised to
find  all the colours reversed, violet          the bottom, orange
                                                                at             the                   at
top. Newton must have had very defective eyes,                         must have           or
been very inattentive, entirely           have overlooked this interesting
                                                      in to
fact; for we often find him              the Optics looking              the hole              at

spectrum have nothing               with vision-making images. “Then,”

   Mr. Ware has written an excellent paper on the use and abuse
of glasses. Perhaps it may be objected to the first experiment of
this paper, that the piece of money radiated light as if from a
centre or focus. To obviate which, I varied the experiment in
the following manner: I first placed the piece of money at the
bottom of the tumbler, and then placed immediately on it a con
cavo-concave lens; on filling in the water, I found the image
formed, as already represented.                              I
                                            now placed a plano-convex
lens over        it,
                with the same results: here the rays were reflected
to  afocus, and consequently they could not answer                refracted              for  a
image.
   The theory       refraction and the retinal theory
                           of                                 vision are                of                     so

SiR, —I PROCEED to send you at account of the unseasonable
florescence of many plants this winter and spring, as I promised
in my last paper on the Peculiarities of the Weather.
   On the first of December a considerable number of plants be
longing to the aestival and autumnal Floras remained in blow:
among others may be reckoned the Chrysanthemum coronarium,
Scaliosa atropurpurea, Papaver Rhoeas, P. somniferum, and
many varieties of Stocks.    The following plants, however, came
into flower after the first of December, and they - opened their

Tables Astronomiques,   publiées par le Bureau des Longitudes
   de France, contenant les Tables de Jupiter, de Saturne, et
   d'Uranus, construites d'après la Theorie de la Mécanique
   Céleste; par M. A. BouvARD.      4to. pp. 138. Paris, 1821.
Is the year 1808, M. Bouvard,         who is well known as an indefa
 tigable observer and calculator, constructed tables of Jupiter and
Saturn, founded on the system of gravity, and on the several ob
 served oppositions, from 1747 to 1804.         Not long after the im
pression of these tables, M. de Laplace discovered an error in
 the analytical part of the process used in the construction, which
influenced the values of the elliptic elements, and consequently
 the tables would not long continue to accord with observation.
    Undaunted by this vexatious occurrence, M. Bouvard recom
 menced his labours, and in the Connaissance des Tems of the
 year 1816, published corrected elements of Jupiter; in the for
mation of which were employed                      all
                                         the observed oppositions and
 quadratures down           1814. The elements

 manner    corrected,  appeared              in
                                     the volume for  1818;   and those
of  Uranus were promised.

       the present volume are comprised tables        the three planets
                                                                      of

 his new tables with the observations,    found the ancient ones        he
 agreed but indifferently, while among the modern ones there was
a   regularly varying difference alternately positive and negative.
 These differences were       great, that     so

   March 8. A letter was read from M. Gauss, respecting a
very simple contrivance for a signal, in geodetical operations,
which may be seen at an immense distance. This contrivance
is nothing more than the common reflecting speculum of a sex
tant; being about two inches long, and an inch and a half broad;
and mounted in such a manner that it may always reflect the
solar rays to the given distant point, notwithstanding the motion
of the sun. The instrument, thus mounted, he calls a heliotrope:
and the reflected light was so powerful that, at 10 miles distant,
it was too bright for the telescope of the theodolite, and it was
requisite to cover a part of the mirror.       At 25 miles distant,
the  light appeared like a beautiful star, even when one of the
stations was enveloped in fog and rain: and at 66 miles distant,
it was still sufficiently powerful as a signal. In fact, the only
limit which appears to the use of this beautiful instrument, is
that which arises from the curvature of the earth.
   This Society has just announced the publication of the first
volume of their MEMoIRs: which must be highly interesting to
every lover of Astronomy. With a true zeal for the science, they
have resolved to present copies to   their Associates, and

222.                      Explosion     of a       Gasometer.
this place is the reservoir of gas for supplying Blackfriars-road
and the adjacent streets. The gasometer was quite new, and at
the time of the accident contained about 160 tons of water.
John Morgan, an engineer, was thrown from the gasometer full
ten yards over the wall of Mr. Andrews's premises in Green-street,
and killed on the spot.   The damage done to the neighbourhood.
was very considerable, and a great many persons were severely
hurt. Mr. Roper's (a bone-boiler) premises were completely de
stroyed, and he narrowly escaped with his life. Several houses
and other manufactories have been much injured.          But the most
afflicting scene of all, is the calamity suffered by Mrs. Clarke,
whose husband was on Wednesday last scalded to death, by losing
his hold, and falling into a cauldron of boiling water in Green
street.   The power of the water was such on the bursting of the
gasometer, that it completely washed away Mrs. Clarke's house,
and a little girl in arms was dreadfully hurt, and carried away by the
force of the water nearly fifty yards from whence the house stood.
   On Monday the 18th of March, a coroner's inquest was held
on the body of Morgan, when the following evidence on the sub
ject was given:
    Thomas Mees, a smith, stated, that he was sent up to London
 in the beginning of June, and was employed to put up the tanks :
two of them were put up before Christmas, and that which burst
since. A month since a crack appeared in one of the plates of the
 tank, which enlarged, and broke out above, where a new patch
was put. Witness and the deceased were employed to repair
                                                                                    it,
 and caused another plate          to
                                made    be
                                        cover the fissure. On this
                                                      to
being done, they found that the first patch must      taken off,         be         to
have holes drilled for the screws;   piece     pasteboard and then
                                                  a         of
the new   plates were  placed over the crack,   and supported                      by
                                                                                    a

                                        adjoining  wall, and made
every thing water-tight. While they were putting         the screws,     in
the iron hoop, which was the main support          the tank, burst, of
and dropped off. Witness then said       the deceased, “The tank
                                                      to

            it to

but    as  held together, they agreed      endeavour   to mend the        to
hoop, and returned for that purpose, when the deceased pro
ceeded       to
           climb         up
                     the side           of
                                 the tank                  to
                                            throw down some dust
to stop the cracks,           as
                         the water was running out fast. Witness
again called out, “Come away, it's sure       burst,” and stooped
                                                            to

                  the fallen hoop, when the tank gave way, and
the water carried witness away about eighteen yards.     On reco
vering himself,          he
                      found the deceased       timber-yard, about

groaning and bleeding till he was taken to a public-house, where
he died in a few minutes. The tank was forty-three feet eight in
diameter, eighteen feet deep; it was nearly full of water. Witness
could not tell what caused the fissure; he did not think there was
any flaw in the iron plates; he never observed the foundation give
way.    The remaining tanks were fourteen inches only less than
the one which had burst. Several of the Jury commented on the
dangerous situation of the premises, and said they ought not to be
placed so near the habitations of the surrounding neighbour
hood.
    Mr.  Percival (a Juror) said but few of the plates exceeded half
an inch in thickness in the centre, and contended they were not
sufficiently strong; he spoke from his own knowledge, for he
knew the plates for vats were generally an inch and an inch and a
half in thickness.-Another Juror said, that if it was only made
of tin, and the hoops were sufficiently strong, it would not break.
Mr. Percival resumed, and said, the hoop was not stronger than
that which he had round a vat that contained only two tons of
water.—Robert Monro, Esq. a Director of the Gas Company,
said the tank contained 752 tons of water.         The plates were
three-quarters of an inch in thickness; some were stouter. The
works were furnished by contract; the ironmasters engaging to
make them water-tight. The contractors had put up eleven tanks
in London, which were                  all
                               standing.   The whole loss (the tank
cost between 700l. and S001.) would fall     the contractors.    on                              It
was one foot longer than the others, but   did not know whether he
the iron was made proportionally stronger.   Of course the build
ing was left    the  contractors,
                       to         and  was their interest

 The other seven      also, who showed          small knots, drank the

then tread the axle round at a force of 100 lbs. The superiority
over the common method is this:—A man when he pulls sculls or
oars, pulls them through the water twenty-four times in a minute,
and the strength of his pulling is computed at about 30 lbs. each
time.     By Mr. Van H.’s method the paddles pass through the
water 136 times in a minute; and as only two paddles are in the
water at the same time, each paddle is passed through the water
by a force of 50 lbs. There is not sufficient space on a canal to
allow of the use of oars. This newly invented machinery is very
simple and can be taken off the vessel in a moment, and so light
that a man can walk away with it with as much ease as he can
with a pair of oars. Two men can propell a canal barge with this
contrivance at the rate of five miles an hour.     The expense of
keeping track roads for horses to draw the barges, and the ex
pense of keeping the horses themselves, seem to make this a
great desideratum to       canal property.”

of the smut insect becoming addled, or rendered      effete, when kept
beyond the season assigned by nature for their procreation or re
production: hence old wheat seed is less liable to produce smut
than new wheat; but this depends in some measure upon the
manner in which the old wheat had been kept; if in stacks, the
insects' eggs will not have been entirely destroyed, because of the
air having been excluded from those situated in the middle of
the stack; but in the event of the wheat being thrashed out a
considerable time previously, the eggs will have become addled,
from exposure to the air. The same position holds good in regard
to the eggs of other insects, reptiles, or birds: one law of Nature
rules the whole; and it even extends to the germ of vegetables,
for we see that old wheat seed kept in stacks vegetates better
than when kept in granaries.        This explanation will sufficiently
account for the contrariety of opinion respecting the eligibility of
using old wheat for seed, whether for producing a full crop of
wheat, or as a prevention of smut.”—Baker's Trealise.

                          the GOLDEN PIPPIN.                  -
   Mr.  Phillips   of Bayswater, who has  lately written an historical
account of Fruits, has furnished us with some further account of
that elegant and excellent little English apple the Golden Pippin,
and which we hope will so satisfactorily prove the error of this
variety's being lost through sympathy with the parent tree, that
it may induce the planters of orchards to return to a cultivation
of this favourite apple that produces a cider, which Mr. Phillips.
tells us surpasses in richness of flavour even “the gay Cham
paigne.”
    Mr. Phillips, seems not to have confined his inquiries to this
country alone as to the correctness of the theory, which had so
far gained credit as nearly to banish this favourite apple from our
gardens.     He tells us that there are at this time a considerable
number of the true golden pippin trees growing on the mountains
in Madeira, about 14 miles from the capital of that island, and
at an elevation of about 3000 feet above the sea, which regularly
produce abundance of fruit, notwithstanding the trunks and
branches are covered with a white lichen or moss. Grafts which
were sent from these trees by Thomas Harrison, Esq. about three
years ago, produced fruit at Cheshunt in Hertfordshire the second
year, and proved to be the original golden pippin.                      -
    In several   parts of America these trees are in a  thriving  state,
which has been proved by the excellent quality of the fruit lately
sent to this country.      In addition to which he tells us he saw,
notwithstanding the late unfavourable season, many trees of this
variety in Sussex, as healthy in appearance as most other kinds
 of apples, particularly in the garden of Messrs.

     Chichester, where the fruit was of a size and perfection that he       e
     had never seen surpassed.
        Mr. Phillips admits that the golden pippin is a more delicate
    tree than many other varieties, but by no means so much so as is
    generally supposed, and it only requires, as it deserves, the most
    genial situation of the orchard to render it as prolific as formerly.
    About the year 1685 Lord Clarendon had, at his seat at Swal
    lowfield, Berks, an orchard of 1000 golden and other cider pip
    p in S.
       Pippins are said to take their names from the small spots or
    pips that usually appear on the sides of these kinds of apples, and
    which is no indication of decay.

one of the party.    It is supposed to be a species of Boa so com

specting this earthquake:—“At Aix they experienced two suc
ceeding shocks, which lasted about seven seconds. The noise was
like that we heard here. A number of chimneys fell. The waters,
impregnated with sulphur, were of a whitish grey colour, and they
continued in a state of agitation near two hours. Their tempera
ture did not vary.    All the phaenomena were the same as those
observed at the  earthquake   which happened at Lisbon in 1755.
At Yenne, where a religious ceremony had called many persons to
church, at the moment the preacher had uttered his exordium,
“We are suspended between heaven and hell,” a frightful noise
was heard. The vaulted roof of the church opened, and a shower
of stones and mortar descended on       sides.       all

         AMERICAN ASYLUM FOR THE DEAF AND DUMB.
   An examination        the pupilsof  the New York Institution,

                                   of                      that city,                            at
on the 25th of October 1821.      The number of unfortunates were
sixty, who excited much interest        the manner          by
                                                        which they                          in
went  through   their exercises.    Miss Barnard from Utica ex
                                                   A
pressed    signs the Lord's prayer, and
            in                              one could fail    under     no                            to
stand her.    Her attitude was devotional, her gestures graceful
and significant, her countenance expressive, and her whole per
formance indicated        knowledgea        what her signs expressed:
                                                        of
she had   only  been under instruction fourteen months.
   The exercise which followed was one               memory, and       this  of                            in
               part.    Among

several took                       the rest Miss Barnard reduced
writing the Lord's prayer, which she had previously rendered
signs.    Another pupil wrote the history          the creation—a third,    of
the flood—a fourth, the ten commandments—while another wrote
from memory the character                     of
                                      Christ—and       sixth, the miracle        a
of Christ curing the deaf and the blind.
   Next followed two small girls, not more than nine              ten years                      or
old, who conjugated,            writing by   the black      on

But, what is most wonderful, they both arrive at the proper result,
though by different means: since they both tried the experiment
of placing a plant without water, without earth, but in a very moist
atmosphere, and the plant has remained alive, nay, increased in
weight, while another vegetable placed by     side     the same cir         its             in
cumstances has died directly,–proving that the first absorbed
all   its
       nutriment from the atmosphere, and had            radicles                           no                   to   its
roots; and that the other was     earthy plant receiving

   But the hairs are not designed for absorption only,         one sort                               or
of form would have sufficed: whereas             each vegetable there      in

observations, the force has a little diminished: I suspect that it
will increase when the earth shall have passed the aphelion.
   My second magnetic discovery is the following: I have found
that every vertical body SN, whatever it be, and of any kind of
matter, has a North-pole at bottom and a South-pole at top, as
in all vertical bars of iron.

For otherwise it would be impossible to explain the phaenomena
which I have observed, and which I have determined by a great
number of incontestable experiments; namely, that the mag
netic cylinder oscillates more quickly towards the North in a,
and more slowly towards the South in b. And, on the contrary,
it oscillates more slowly towards the North in c, and faster                                            to
wards the South in d.      I have found this law constantly con
firmed by my experiments near the walls and partitions of houses,
whether of wood or stone, and even near large trees in the gar
dens.     This action must necessarily exert      influence, indeed       its

valve being rudely made, I concluded that some other plan of
the valve was advisable, though Mr. Leeson thought the same
valve repaired would do.      The plan                   I
                                           proposed is now intro
duced in Mr. Leeson's own words, quoted also from his letter of
18th January.     It was submitted before Mr. L. to one Andayna
for such alteration and improvement as he saw necessary.
   “Your plan of two button valves, to be connected
together by a solid spindle up the sides of which the
gas was to pass, and which were to be rendered air
tight by two pieces of leather attached to their under
surfaces, and the buttons were to be prevented from
rising too high by two small bits of wire inserted above
the upper valve.” This may perchance be pronounced
not a “modification ” of that to which we find
“H.   B. Leeson invt. et del.” attached.     But there is
no doubt of            its
                  being equally safe—by this provision
of   adouble guard both valves closing simultaneously.
   Allow me      ask, sir, why this anxiety
                      to                         entertain    with  to              us

30 cwt. is seldom taken ; whereas 15 cwt. is a moderate load
for the former, thereby making two horses do the work of three.
Though in journeys this is the proportion, yet in the work upon
a farm, such as manuring land, &c. it is still more ; as from the
greater facility the one-horse carts afford in filling and emptying,
three horses in this way will often, when roads are good, do as
much work as six in the other way, that is to say, with three to
a cart.    One advantage, however, which the English system

together with what has been stated respecting the thrashing, I
have little doubt will make a difference of five per cent. in the

Sir,      – The great expansibility of the Caoutchouc or India
rubber is well known: but I am not aware that any endeavours
have heretofore been made to inflate the bottles made of that
substance, with air, with a view to enlarge their capacity.     On
Tuesday the 19th instant, I threw some        into   small bottle            air        a

LVIII.    On melting Caoutchouc, or India-Rubber, and pre
   serving Iron and Steel from Rust.   By ARthur AikiN, Esq.
   Secretary to the  Society  for the Encouragement of Arts,
   Manufactures and Commerce*.
                                           19, John-street,          Adelphi, Dec. 24, 1821.
DEAR SIR,--          You   well know the many attempts that have
been made to       preserve  iron and steel from rust, and the small
success with which       they  have been in general attended.             Greasy
and oily, or resinous, substances have formed the basis of the
different preparations proposed and employed for this purpose:
but in the former, when rancidity comes on, an acid is produced
which corrodes, the iron; and the latter, when dry, are apt to
crack, and thus afford an inlet to moisture, which, as soon as it
has insinuated itself, begins to act on the iron, and to throw off
the varnish in scales, on account of the enlargement of bulk
which the particles of iron undergo when converted into oxide.
    Some time ago the thought occurred to me, that melted
caoutchouc would be found to possess peculiar advantages in
 preserving the surface of iron from being acted on by the atmo
sphere; arising from            its
                                little susceptibility                     of

 when    exposed      to
                       the  air;   from       treacly its

 ordinary temperatures; from                    its
                                           strong adhesion           the surface    to
of    iron or   steel; and     by  the same time from the facility with
                               a at

 I      accordingly made the trial,               by
                                            procuring small plates            iron                of
 and  of   steel, and  smearing     one half       their surfaceof lightly   over
                                                                      on
 with the caoutchouc, and exposing them                     table     a  labora       in  a

 the portions        the plates covered

LX.      On the Culture                of the Pear          Tree.               By Thomas ANDREw

The      pear-tree exercises the patience of the planter during a
longer period, before it affords fruit, than any other grafted tree
which finds a place in our gardens; and though it is subsequently
very long-lived, it generally, when trained to a wall, becomes in
a few years unproductive of fruit, except at the extremities of                                              its
lateral branches.      Both these defects are, however,       have good                     I

            to       the result    improper  management;

productive       every part, and my young trees have almost always
                  in

have remained barren beyond the third year.

 thus trained, had long reached the top          the wall, and had be      of
 come wholly unproductive.         The other branches afforded but
 very little fruit, and that never acquiring maturity, was conse
 quently     of  value;
                      no     that      so
                                     was necessary

            as             as   to
                       render the tree  productive.
    To attain these purposes, every branch which did not want
 least twenty degrees        being perpendicular, was taken out
                                      of                                                                     at at
 its base; and the spurs upon every other branch, which                                                 I    in
 tended      retain, were taken off closely with the saw and chisel.

 Into these branches,       their subdivisions, grafts were inserted
                                      at                                                                     at
different distances from the root, and some         near the extre                    so
mities      of
           the branches,  that the tree extended       widely    the                       as           in
autumn, after     was grafted,
                           it      did    the  preceding

grafts were also                so
                    disposed, that every part    the space the tree              of
previously covered was equally well supplied with young wood.
       As
       soon     the succeeding summer
                      in                     the young shoots had          as
attained sufficient length, they were trained almost perpendicu
larly downwards, between the larger branches and the wall                                                    to
which they were nailed. The most perpendicular remaining
branch upon each side was grafted about four feet below the top
of  the wall, which      twelve feet high; and the young shoots,
                                     is
which the grafts upon these afforded, were trained inwards, and
bent down         occupy the space from which the old central
                       to
branches had been taken away, and therefore very little vacant
space any where remained         the end      the first autumn.

the grafts in the succeeding spring; but in the following year,
and subsequently, I have had abundant crops, equally dispersed
over every part of the tree; and I have scarcely ever seen such
an exuberance of blossom as this tree presents in the present
spring (1813). Grafts of eight different kinds of pears had been

The number of solar and lunar halos is nearly equal; the greatest

proof of their being prognostics of approaching rain, as is almost

every other meteoric phaenomenon.           The frequent appearance
of rainbows, both single and double, has enabled us to disprove
Dr. Watt's new theory of their formation, as published by him.
in the Annals of Philosophy, vol. xiii. p. 131.
    METEoRs, both small and large, have also appeared frequently.
Their connexion with, or appearance before, wind and rain, we
have fully shown in the last volume of the Philosophical Magazine

tract regularly 55-60, and    even 65 litres of spirits at 10° from
a  quintal  of barley.  This statement may seem exaggerated to
the distillers of the east and the interior, who do not obtain on
an average more than from 40 to 44 litres from the same quan
tity of grain, and some scarcely from 30 to 35; but it is con
firmed by the experience of a great many distilleries.      Perhaps
there is no art which presents anomalies more remarkable.
   It would be curious to trace minutely the causes of these dif
ferences; but practice has got so much the advance of theory
in this species of manufacture, that we are still forced to reason
about it with much timidity. The fact which I am going to
mention as explanatory of these differences, appears to me how
ever sufficiently conclusive, and without pretending that it is the
only cause, I believe it will be found at least the principal one.
    Filled with chemical doctrines, I was surprised, on frequenting
the premises of our distillers, to see them sinking at a great ex
pense vast pits to procure water, when they might have sup
plied themselves cheaply from the river, which flowed close by.
I  asked them the cause of their preference; but without being
able to explain it to me, they            all
                                         agreed       answering that they

LXIII.        On a Method of firing a Transit Instrument exactly
         in the Meridian. By F, BAILY, Esq. F.R.S. & L.S.*
TH E.               transit instrument is so essential                                 a part         of the apparatus
of the practical astronomer, that every attempt to facilitate the
use of it will doubtless be received with indulgence.       When
this instrument has been brought nearly in the plane of the me
ridian (which may be done by any of the methods pointed out
in the several works on practical astronomy), it may be adjusted
accurately by either of the following modes:             observation                              1°.      by
                                                                          its

   On July 1, 1819, I placed my transit instrument nearly in the
meridian; and in order to ascertain how much it deviated from
the true meridian I observed the two stars y Lyrae and r Sagit
tarii. The         passage          of the former was observed at 18". 52'. 37",3,
and of the latter at 18". 56%. 4",5 sidereal time.  The apparent
right ascensions of those stars, on that day, were 18". 52'. 9",8
and 18%. 55'. 39",7 respectively: and their declinations were
32°. 27’ north, and 27°. 55' south.    Consequently the operation
will stand thus

difference between the observed and apparent time of the
transit of y Lyrae is (18". 52'. 37",3–18". 52'. 9",8)=+27",5:
the deviation of the transit instrument has been found to be
 –8",75 in time, and the number in the table, against N (=32°)
is 39: the product of these two is          1",5: so that 27",5                 –
— 1",5=26",0 is the error of the clock at the time of observa
tion, which being positive shows that the clock was too fast. I
shall here repeat that the observed time, here alluded to, is sup
posed to be sidereal time: and therefore if mean solar time be
employed in the observation, it must be converted into sidereal
time, by any of the methods laid down for that purpose.            It
may be useful to remark that, in      observations      this kind,   all                           of              it

 an  examination            of

the appearance, and find it about as distinct as it was about ten
minutes before I discontinued observing on the night of the 4th.
The spot is certainly Aristarchus; but it is now much more
difficult to observe on account of the moon throwing much more
light down the tube of the telescope, and the luminous advancing
edge being much nearer the spot, and my telescope having a
large aperture: but I should imagine, if my 42-inch tube were                                           in
closed in one which projected five or six feet beyond the object
glass, that the spot might be seen one night at least longer.
When I first examined on the 4th the proportion of light thrown
on the moon by the earth, and consequently on Aristarchus, was
 1.777 out of 2000; to-night it was only 1:422, a diminution of
•355; consequently exactly one-fifth less light is reflected by
the spot, to say nothing of the inconvenience arising from the
addition of one-fifth to the light of the moon.         Hevelius de
scribes Aristarchus under the name Mons Porphyrites, as aut
er rupe rubrá, aut sabulo (this, by the by, is impossible; for the

A   Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast; describing the
   Strata and Fossils occurring between the Humber and the Tees,
  from the German Ocean to the Plain of York. Illustrated
   with numerous Engravings.       By the Rev. GEORGE YouNg,
   A.M. and John      Bird, Artist. 4to, pp. 328. Whitby, 1822.
Ir is   not a little remarkable, that while philosophers have for
ages been employed in contemplating those bright orbs which
bespangle the sky, soaring on the wings of science through the
regions of immeasurable space, surveying the magnitudes, sta
tions and motions of the heavenly bodies, and in studying the
laws which govern the remotest planets, little attention has been
devoted to the planet we inhabit.        It is true, that viewing the
features and   exploring the depths   of the earth on which we tread,
is not so attractive as the  pursuits  of astronomy; but the study is
neither   uninteresting  nor unimportant,     and has an equal claim
on our attention.
   That a study of such importance as geology should hitherto
have had so small a share among scientific pursuits, is the more
remarkable, since at a very remote period men began to penetrate
into the bowels of the earth in quest of the shining metals, and
other valuable products of the mineral kingdom; and the attention
of the learned, both in ancient and modern times, has often been
directed to the nature and classification of minerals.  To these
objects their pursuits were limited until within the last twenty
or thirty years, few philosophers attempting to investigate the
structure of the earth itself;                 or,
                                       they did, they rather indulged

in wild  conjectures  than entered into sober and patient exami

nation   ofthe facts. Geology has now, however, begun              assume                to
its proper rank among the sciences, and, desisting            great mea        in  a
sure from the flights       fancy, has been proceeding
                                   of                            the more           in
legitimate track      laborious research. But although the collec

to be done in the present stage of the science is to enrich it with
ample stores derived from actual observation; to collect informa
tion concerning the character and relative positions of the sub
stances composing the solid part of the globe; to specify their
arrangement, extent and localities, and to notice such hints as
they may furnish for elucidating the history of our planet. Every
addition to these stores will serve to enlarge and consolidate the
basis on which a true theory of the earth, if such can be found,
must necessarily rest.
   Although the British Isles have been very attentively surveyed,
and every thing relating to the geological features of some                                               di

deemed an extinct genus, has been found recent; and the same
remark is applicable to a few other genera. After the recent ac
cessions which natural history has acquired, particularly the dis
covery of the ornithorhynchus and of the animal of Stronsay, we
need not despair of seeing the lizard-fish in a living state.
   “The authors of the hypothesis of successive creations, or for
mations as they are more frequently termed, have not told us
what we are to make of the extensive strata containing no or
ganic remains, or next to none, intervening between strata that
abound with them.     Was the creative power suspended or con
tracted for some ages? Did worlds of barren sand alternate with                                -       -
worlds replete with life?
   “We have other objections to produce against this theory, but
they will appear with more advantage under the next observation.
   “We have reason to believe, from the facts before us, that no
considerable interval occurred between the deposition of the se
veral members of our strata; but that they were           deposited                all
nearly about the same period.—The doctrine       successive forma       of

one formation and another; and that the lowest strata are                                           of
very high antiquity, while the upper strata, such         the chalk                as
beds, are comparatively quite modern. To the same system be

   What has been so long and so ardently sought for by ship
    :
builders, we believe to be now nearly if not wholly attained. We
allude to the discovery of timber which will secure a ship's bot
tom against the terrible invasion of the worm, so universally de
    structive.                                                                            -    -                  º
   This discovery was accidentally made by Captain Thomas
Shields, during his residence at the bay of St. Louis. He found
that a particular stake, used for fastening a boat, had remained
perfectly good and staunch for a year; whereas others had to be
replaced every two or three months, being destroyed by the
worm. On examination, this stake proved to be of Sweet Gum,
a timber usually considered of no value. Captain S. deciding to
make a full and fair experiment, procured a small tree of the sweet
gum, hewed it down until it squared nine inches, and then had
it staked in three feet water, affording every opportunity, to the
worm. This sweet gum stick, remained thus exposed for four
years; when on examination it was found perfectly free from
moss, barnacle, and                      all   other exerescence; and           on   hewing                down

except three   four very  or
                         small punctures   inconsiderable depth.      of
Captain Shields communicated these facts       Commodore Pat               to
terson some years ago. The Commodore declared his intention                                                      of
making further experiment

 the cultivator has no hopes of a good crop. The news from the
 interior of the empire of the effects of the winter, are equally un
 favourable.   In the southern provinces there, it had been colder
 than here, but it was unaccompanied with snow; and the thaw
commenced in the middle of January. The Duna was clear of
ice on the 2nd of March, and, what is unusual, the breaking up
of the frost did no damage. The navigation is open at Riga,
and an English vessel has already arrived in that port from Hull.
   In Siberia, where winter is constantly severe, the weather has
been comparatively temperate; warm winds have been prevalent
at Tobolsk, and to the north-east.      Above all, the snow is                                 al
ready gone.     At Bereson,  one of the most northern cities in this
country, it rained heavily on the 28th of December, a circumstance
never before known by the oldest inhabitant.               -

   Possibly some light may be thrown upon the subject by the so
lutions, which may this year be expected, of a problem regarding
coronae, which was proposed two years ago by a distinguished
institution on the continent; supported as the arguments pro
bably will be, by the recent improvements in the theory of light.
   The inquiry is doubtless rendered still more perplexing on ac
count of the great halo being accompanied, much more frequently
 (according to the observations of Dr. Burney) than is generally
supposed, by the appearance of parhelia or mock-suns.         These
are most usually situated in the circumference of the great halo,
at the same height above the horizon as the real sun, and are
connected with a horizontal beam of white light extending to a
greater or smaller distance in a direction opposite to the sun. In
fact, two classes of coincident phenomena are to be accounted
for; viz. coronae having the sun, or moon, for their common
centre, and luminous circles or arches parallel to the horizon.
The former, when observed by reflection from still water, appear
sometimes very numerous.       The latter are of rare occurrence, if
we may judge from the small number of recorded observations.
   These reflections were elicited by the appearance of a very                            in
teresting combination of such phenomena, which I had the plea
sure of witnessing yesterday in the vicinity of this city. The halo
was very perfect, increasing in brightness towards the summit.
The sun shone with dazzling brightness through a light stratum
of vapours. Both parhelia were very bright, coloured on the side

           BiographY.—EDWARD              DANIEL CLARKE, LL.D.
    There are few names better or more extensively known than
Edward Daniel Clarke, who by his travels has rendered himself
celebrated not only in Europe but in every quarter of the civi
lized world. Dr. Clarke was of a literary family; his maternal
grandfather was the very eminent Dr. William Wotton, well
known in the literary world by his proficiency when an infant in
a great variety of languages; and his grandfather and grandmo
ther were happily designated by the poet Hayley, in an affec
tionate epitaph, as
           “Auld William Clarke,          and Anne his wife.”
   Mr. Clarke, among other works, published “The Comnexion
of the Roman, Saxon, and English Coins.”       His son, the father
of the subject of the present memoir, the Rev. Edward Clarke,
was like his father a man of genius and a scholar.
   Edward Daniel Clarke was born in the year 1769, and was
educated at Jesus College, Cambridge; in 1790 he took the de
gree of B.A.; in 1794 M.A., and became senior fellow of that
College.   Soon after taking his degree, Dr. Clarke accompanied
the present Lord Berwick abroad, and remained for some time
in Italy. The classic scenes he there met with, and his own                     in
quisitive genius, stimulated him to enter into a wider field of re
search; and shortly after his return to England, he embarked
on those travels which have rendered his mane so distinguished.
To enter into any description of them is needless—they are be
fore the public.  They have been, and will continue to be, the
delight and solace of those who have been unable to visit other
countries; and they have excited the dormant spirit of curiosity
in many a resident of the University, who has followed eagerly
the steps of Dr. Clarke, and has invariably borne testimony to
the accuracy and fidelity of his narrative. Dr. Clarke has some
where mentioned all the excellencies which must unite to form a
perfect traveller—he must have the pencil of Norden, the pen
of Volney, the learning of Pococke, the perseverance of Bruce,
the enthusiasm of Savary.      Of      all
                                       these Dr. Clarke united     his     in
own   person   byfar the greater  share.   No difficulties   hisinpro
gress were ever allowed     to   beinsuperable; and upon         occaall
sions  he imparted    to
                       others    portion        of
                                             his own enthusiasm.
                                                                                he It

    reigners, we may in the same manner refer our readers to the
    various honorary societies in which his name stands enrolled;
    and we may safely say, that to no one person has the University
    of Cambridge been more indebted for celebrity abroad during the
    last twenty years, than to her late librarian, Dr. Clarke. He has
    fallen a victim indeed to his generous ardour in the pursuit of
    science—he looked only to the fame of the University; and in
    his honest endeavours to exalt her reputation, he unhappily  neg

-       Perhaps no person ever possessed in a more eminent degree
    than   Dr. Clarke, the delightful faculty of winning the hearts and
    riveting the affections of those into whose society he entered.
    From the first moment his conversation excited an interest that
    never abated.    Those who knew him once, felt that they must
    love him always.     The kindness of his manner, the anxiety he
    expressed for the welfare of others, his eagerness to make them
    feel happy and pleased with themselves, when united to the charms
    of his language, were irresistible. Such was Dr. Clarke in his
     private life—within the circle of his more immediate friends. In
     the midst of his family, there he might be seen as the indulgent
     parent, the affectionate husband, the warm, zealous, and sincere
     friend. Of                 his
                      public life the present limits will only admit                                 of

SiR,   -     Since I
                   mentioned to you, in my letter of 26th March,
that I had expanded a small bottle of Caoutchouc (India-Rubber)
by means of a condensing syringe, I have been informed of
several instances of such bottles having been stretched in a like
or nearly like manner some years ago, so that what I communi
cated to you as new, was not so.                             -
   I have some  notion, that in one of the periodical  publications
a few years ago, there was an account of a bottle of this sub
stance having been considerably enlarged by letting in coal gas,
the bottle being attached to the end of a gas-light pipe: probably
 the caoutchouc might have been softened first.
    An ingenious artist, well known by his excellent paintings for
 magic-lantern slides, named Matthias More, has informed me
 that he has stretched bottles of caoutchouc with a common pair
 of bellows, after they were become soft by having been soaked
 for many hours in warm (not boiling) water.
    Mr. More also has stretched pieces of this substance to a very
 great length, until they became exceedingly thin and transpa
 rent. I have seen some small pieces or leaves of            which ap   it,
 peared not unlike gold-beaters’ skin, and were              beautifulof
                                                                      a
 looking substance. With such power, Mr. More says            has made     he
 air-balloons the size        common hen’s egg, which when filled
                               ofa
 with gas ascended.       He had     plan for making long pieces                         of
 this substance,          to
                      use instead        of a
                                     glass slides for magic-lanterns,
 on  which the figures were,    understand,
                                    I              printed, and after
                                                          to   be
 wards coloured; but not succeeding         some partin   the process,of
 he  gave     up
               the scheme altogether.       The pieces       which the  on
 figures were,       he
                   intended should              be
                                        wound on, and off,      axis,           an       in
 the manner that    tapes for measuring  are;    that,     so
                                                       had the scheme
 succeeded, long processions might have been exhibited without

changed.     But if the chlorine is in excess, the fluid becomes of
a yellow  tint,  and acid fumes are produced. This circumstance
alone proves that chlorine can take hydrogen from the fluid; and,
on examination, I found it was without the liberation of any car
bon or chlorine.
   That the action thus begun, might be carried to        utmost ex                     its
tent, some      the pure fluid (chloric ether) was put into
                    of                                         retort                          a

contact between the chlorine and the fluid, the latter became
yellow; but when            the sun's rays,
                               in             few moments sufficed

    destroy the colour both      the fluid and the chlorine, heat being
                                     of

    absorption, but     was found full

    expelled, and more chlorine introduced, and the whole again
    exposed    tosun light: the colour again disappeared, and         few                           a
    moist  crystals were formed round the edge      the fluid. Chlorineof
    being a  third time introduced, and treated       before,   still reas                    it
    moved more hydrogen; and now               sublimatea      crystals lined   of
    the retort.     Proceeding      this way until the chlorine exerted
                                         in                                                                   no
    further action, the fluid entirely disappeared, and the results were,
    the dry crystalline substance, and muriatic acid gas.
      A    portion   ofolefiant gas was then mixed         retort with eight
                                                                        in  a

    first the fluid formed;    but this instantly  disappeared;    the retort
    became lined with crystals, and the colour                          of

the substance in alcohol and ether, are dendritical, prismatic, or
in plates; the varieties of form, which are very interesting, are
easily ascertained, and result from a primitive octohedron.

the manner of camphor, towards the light. If warmed, it rises
more rapidly, and then forms fine crystals: when the tempera

 but the weather was not very fine. In the evening the solid
 crystalline substance had formed in abundance, and very little

 change in volume had been produced.         The stop-cock was now
opened under mercury, and a small portion of the metal having
entered, it was agitated in the retort, to absorb the chlorine; the
neck of the retort was left open under the mercury             night,                                    all

348                                 On two new Compounds
bon, I shall have        less occasion to dwell on the proofs that the
 compound I am about to describe, is also a binary combination
 of carbon and chlorine.
    When the vapour of the perchloride of carbon is heated to dull
 redness, chlorine is liberated, and a new compound of that ele
 ment and carbon is produced.                This is readily shown by heating
 the bottom of a small glass tube, containing some of the per
 chloride in a spirit lamp.          The substance at first sublimes; but
 as the   vapour    becomes heated below, it is gradually converted
 into  protochloride,     and chlorine is evolved.
    It is not without considerable, precaution that the protochlo
 ride of carbon can be obtained pure; for though passed through
 a great length of heated tube, part of the perchloride frequently
 escapes decomposition.            The process I have adopted is the fol
lowing: Some of the perchloride is introduced into the closed end
                                                        it,          10

350                                    On two new Compounds
two days the retorts containing the substances were lined with
crystals, which, on examination under the microscope, proved
to be quadrangular plates, resembling those of the perchloride
of carbon. There were also some rhomboidal crystals here and
there. After the formation of these crystals, there was conside
rable absorption in the retort; hence chlorine had combined;
and the gas which remained was chlorine unmixed with any
thing else, except a slight impurity. The solid body, on ex
amination, was found to he volatile, soluble in alcohol, precipi
table by water, and had the smell and other properties of per
chloride of carbon.         Hence, though heat in separating chlorine

   Vol. 59. No. 289. May 1822.                           1820                    Yy

354         An Analysis of Mr. Baily's Astronomical Tables
1820 and 1821, and entitled Astronomische Hülfstafeln; and
which have been considered by many astronomers as of the
highest importance and value.    In consequence however of their
not reaching this country until more than half the current year
for which they were intended had expired, Mr. BAILY, with a
generous and disinterested zeal which merits the highest praise,
resolved to prepare a set of similar tables, prior to the com
mencement of the present year, at his own expense, and to pre
sent copies of the same to his scientific friends. Mr. BAILY, it
appears, only formed this resolution in September last, so that
three months only remained, to collect, arrange, compute, and
print such tables as appeared to him the best adapted to the
general purposes of the practical astronomer.      And with what
success he has completed this important undertaking, every
astronomer who possesses a copy, must have ample and satisfac
tory means of judging; and if I might be allowed to express my
individual feelings on the subject, it would be that Mr. B. de
serves the warmest and best thanks    of the astronomical world.
    Itmay however be possible, that some of the readers of your
valuable Journal may not yet have had an opportunity of seeing
Mr. BAILY's Tables; and I may, therefore, not be rendering an
unacceptable service to them, if I endeavour to give a brief ana
lysis of their contents.
   The volume consists of three parts, the first of which presents
a preface detailing the objects of the publication; the second
contains explanations of the nature and uses of the tables; and
the third is devoted to the tables themselves.    It is an analysis
of the two  latter, which I intend to offer to your readers.
    The first table contains            a list     of the principal occultations of
fixed stars by the moon, visible at Florence, distinguishing the
day, the name or number of the star,                           its
                                              magnitude, the cata
logue from which        taken,
                         it     is right ascension and declination,
                                             its
and the time of its itnmersion and emersion. This table Mr. BAILY
obtained from Baron ZACH's Correspondance Astronomique;
and although, from         being calculated for the meridian and pa

would derive from         table calculated for the latter place.

                                                 the small stars have
been   rejected,  excepting  such    take  place
                                              as  within few days              a                 of

of pages    as the   preceding.
   During the present and several of the following years, the
cluster of stars called the Pleiades will present soune singular
facilities to the practical astronomer, on account of the moon's
nodes being so situated, that she will pass over this beautiful
cluster every lunation; and hence Mr. BAILY has introduced

computed from the tables recently published by M. Bessel in
the fifth part of his Astronomische Beobachtungen, published at
Konigsberg in 1820.      Mr. BAILY properly observes with respect
 to this table, “that it is difficult to account for the general con
sent which seems to have existed amongst astronomers, to ob
serve more particularly those 36 stars, and which have thus ac
quired the name of fundamental stars; because they by no
means furnish the best arrangement that might be made ; some
others might have been selected, more generally distributed over
the heavens.”      Both M. BEssel, and our own AstroNoMER
Roy AL, now make daily observations on every star above the
fifth magnitude, a practice which immortalized the names of
B3ADLEY          and       P1Azzi.                                                             º

M.  Coulomb was employed.       This instrument, as is well known,
consists of a fine wire, attached to an index, moveable round a
circle divided into degrees. To the other end of the wire is
fixed a cradle, to receive the needle which is the subject of ex
periment.    The needle being in the magnetic meridian when the
wire has no torsion, is afterwards forced to deviate from it to a
mark distant about 60°, by turning the index, and consequently
twisting the wire. The number of degrees passed over by the
index will be as the directive force of the needle.              -
   The needles which I have described were first made    soft, and
then hardened merely at their ends; they were not polished,
and were magnetised to saturation.

   By the experiments on magnetism made by M. Coulomb, it
appears, that the directive forces of needles of similar form are
to each other as their masses; the directive force, therefore, of
a needle of the form of a pierced rhombus of 66 grains would be
expressed, according to the preceding experiments, by 638.
   From many other experiments, which I regret were not re
gistered at the time, it appeared that shear-steel was capable
of receiving the greater magnetic force, and that the pierced
rhombus was the best form for a compass-needle.           I may add,
that needles of cast-steel were tried, but were

ferior as to be at once   rejected.
   My next object was to determine the effect of polish, and of
various modes of hardening and tempering the needles.             In
addition to the former needles, two were made of clock-spring
of the pierced rhombus form five inches long, two inches wide,
and weighing 66 grains.       One of these was first softened, then
hardened at the     ends, and left unpolished; the other, as well as
the solid elliptical  needle of spur-steel, was hardened through-r
out, and polished.      The needles were then magnetised to satu

   As it  appeared  from the above   experiments  that the needles
had suffered a gradual deterioration, I imagined that this might
have occurred in consequence of their having been exposed to the
heat of a coal fire, by which some portion of the carbon of the
steel might have been destroyed: I therefore re-carbonised the
needles, by surrounding them with shreds of leather, and ex
posing them for several hours, in a close vessel, to a consider
able heat.    After they had gradually cooled, the ends were hard
ened at a red heat.

   Here we may remark, that though the needles were apparently
in the same state, except being re-carbonised, as in the last ex
periment, they had suffered considerable deterioration.
  The needles were now covered with a mixture, well known to
workmen, to prevent decarbonisation:      this had been before
neglected, but was used in    the subsequent experiments. They
                                        all

except that the needles became less susceptible of directive force
from repeated exposure to heat, and that this effect was not occa
sioned by a decarbonisation of the steel. The small rhombus of
saw-blade, perhaps from being the thickest, suffered less than
those made of clock-spring.
   The springs of clocks are made by passing the steel between
rollers; and it thus undergoes great compression.   May not this
state be favourable to  magnetism;   and the  repeated expansion
of the steel by heat, destroying this state, have occasioned the
deterioration I have remarked 2
   The needle which was made of saw-blade having suffered less
than the others in the preceding experiments, I procured three
other needles of this material; they were cut out of the same
plate; the weight of each was 120 grains, and their length four
inches and a half.    One was a parallelogram, 0.46 inch-wide;
another a rhombus, as before, 0.87 inch-wide; and the third a
pierced rhombus, having the middle 1-5 inch, and                                           its   sides 0-25

less force, and that the magnetism of the needle would                  suffer a
diminution.
   The method I had employed in magnetising the needles, was
that of Du Hamel, by joining the opposite poles of the magnets,
and placing them on the centre of the needle, so inclined that
each formed an angle, as I afterwards ascertained, of about 30
degrees with the horizon.             The magnets were then slid from
the centre to the extremities of the needle, and their poles being
again joined at a distance from the needle, the operation was
repeated.
   As I could in no way account for the diminution of directive
force which I have remarked, except by supposing that I had
inadvertently changed the inclination at which the magnets were
held, I resolved to try whether a variation of this angle produced
any considerable difference in the degree of magnetism commu
nicated.    For this purpose I re-magnetised the meedles, by lay
ing the magnets, with their opposite poles joined, flat upon the
needle, the junction of the magnets being upon the centre. They
were then separated and drawn to the extremities of the needle,
the surface of the needle and that of the magnets being in con
tact the whole time. The poles were then joined and the ope
ration repeated, using but little pressure.
                               Experiment 13.
     Magnets moved flat upon the needle with                 Directive

   This manner of       magnetising,       therefore, appears much supe
rior to that before    employed.

the last experiment, except that the ends of the magnets were
pressed pretty strongly against the needle.

      This last series of experiments presents a curious circum
  stance.      From the experiments made by Coulomb, as well as
  from the general tenor of my own, the rhombus is found capable
  of receiving a greater directive energy than the parallelogram;
  yet here we perceive that the parallelogram, though formed of
  the very same plate of steel as the other needles, is not only un
  der every circumstance superior to the rhombus, but also to the
  pierced rhombus.         It is difficult to form any plausible conjecture-
  as to the cause of this difference.
      The weight of the rhombus in Experiment 10, made of clock
 spring, was 63 grains; that made of saw-blade weighed 120
 grains, or very nearly double.               The directive energy of the for
  mer, after having suffered great deterioration, and when not
  tempered in the most favourable manner, compared with the
  greatest directive energy of the latter, was as 600 to 1210; but
 if we refer to Experiment 6, it may be seen that the greatest
 directive energy of the clock-spring rhombus was 844, which
                                       -
  gives it an advantage of about one-third in directive energy over
  a needle of equal weight made of saw-blade.
      From Experiment 20, it should seem that a needle is suscep
  tible of the greatest directive power, other circumstances being
  similar, when it is hardened throughout at a red-heat, and then
  softened from the middle to within an inch of the extremities,
  till the blue colour which arises            has again disappeared.

     next proceeded to try, in a more regular manner, the effect of
different methods of magnetising, and at the same time to ascer
tain whether the directive force was influenced by extent of sur
face, independent of mass. Two needles were made of the same
kind of steel, in the form of right-angled parallelograms, five
inches long, the one 0:7 inch wide, and the other half this width.
The widest was reduced in thickness until it was of the same

face.   For this purpose I had three cylinders made of soft iron,
about two inches and a half in diameter, and nearly the same in
height.   One of the cylinders was of sheet-iron less than the
20th of an inch in thickness; the second of that kind called
chest plate, 0.185 inch thick; and the third was of solid wrought
iron. The first weighed 2760, the second 9376, and the solid
cylinder 22929 grains.    Previous to the experiments they were
all made red-hot,     destroy any accidental magnetism.

  These last results perfectly coincide with the deductions of
Mr. Barlow, that the effect of iron on a ship's compass is as the
surface, and is wholly independent of the mass; but that a cer
tain degree of thickness of the iron (about two-tenths of an inch)
is necessarv to the complete development of this effect.                     z

drawn from the experiments I have detailed:
    That the best material for compass-needles is clock-spring:
but care must be taken in forming the needle to expose it as
seldom as possible to heat, otherwise              capability       receiving its                       of

LXXV.    On the Apparatus for restoring the Action of the Lungs
  in apparent Death. By John MURRAY, F.L.S.M.W.S. &c.
                                             To Dr. Tilloch.
SIR,     -. I
            conFEss that I am not a little surprised at a com
 munication by “Mr. John Moore junior,” in your Number for
 March last. With sufficient self-complacency this correspondent
considers the plan he proposes for restoring the action of the
 lungs as “more complete” than my invention.        Mr. John Moore
junior is pleased to adopt the form of the syringe which I had
done long before; aye, and constructed and published too; and
 he ever condescends to add, that                                “it
                                           might be well to enclose
one of them (i.e. of the syringes) with a case to contain hot
water similar to the description given by Mr. J. Murray.”
    I never believed myself infallible, or that my invention was
incapable of improvement.     I hope I am not so absurd or unrea
sonable; but I do fearlessly assert, that his improvement, as he
insinuates it to be, is one which adds to the complexity of the
mechanism without subserving        utility; nay, rather injures the
                                                           its
                       serve. Various plans presented themselves

your correspondent Mr. John Moore junior, was immediately
rejected, from             its
                     complete uselessness.   Because, until natural
respiration returns, the air impelled into the lungs and with
                                                    the piston, un               of

brances was more     ponderous,   complex,   and heavy and difficult
in operation.                                                                                       .

bottom of the plough, not having at first the miserable effect of
making the bottom of the worked ground hard and firm, like a
turnpike road; the continued successive use of the plough, how
ever, soon showed the bad effect, in the diminished health and
vigour of the trees, &c.         Fortunately this observation was made
when men for spade work were easier to be obtained, than at
the period when the use of the plough was adopted, and in part

   The digging, as at my common nursery price, costs fourpence
per rood, of forty-nine square yards (the rood of this country) or
thirty-three shillings per acre; the transplanting, fourpence half
penny per thousand; but there is a great saving of seed, from
one to two pecks of wheat producing as many plants as are suffi
cient to plant an acre, whereas the usual quantity for plough
cultivation, sown broadcast, is eight pecks, or two bushels per
acre. The following, on these data, is a calculation of the ex

The average of my neighbourhood, I believe, is about twenty
four bushels, but instead of making that a criterion by which to
make the comparison, I have to state, that in the autumn of
 1819 a good deal of pains was taken to ascertain the quantity
of wheat upon a field immediately adjoining my land, and which
was what is considered a remarkably fine crop, by which it ap
peared to be thirty-eight bushels per acre; this was on land,
although adjoining, yet of a naturally better quality than mine,
and quite as highly manured, worked, in the usual manner of
this country, with a two-horse plough, and sown broadcast. By
inspection it will be seen, that the average quantity of my drilled
and broadcast experiments in 1819 and 1820, is 684 bushels per
acre: the value of seed wheat has been assumed to be 9s. per
bushel, I will however for a whole crop take it lower, say 8s. per

be known; I therefore state, that the quality of my land on

applied when the turnip seed was sown, and no more added
when they were transplanted: but, considering the state of the
land, from the effect of the larches and the turnip seed, it was
thought that justice would not be done to the wheat without an
application of a smaller portion of the same sort of manure, and
I gave it 10 tons per acre.
   I have not yet made any experiments, by spade culture, on
oats and barley, but I am intending to make one or more upon
each of those grains, and perhaps on beans, the ensuing spring:
I am at present digging part of one of my fields for that purpose,
the results of which shall be detailed to you.          -
   Being desirous of ascertaining how far, and at what expense,
it may be practicable to work land by the spade, by women, boys,
girls, and feeble old men, in order, among other reasons, to the
employment of paupers of that description, in which, alas! this
country, south of the Tweed, superabounds; I have this autumn
made an experiment on a piece of land containing 1728 square
yards, by digging or rather trenching by two short spits.with
girls, and I have the pleasure of saying that the work is better
done by two such short spits, each about five to six inches deep,
the one following the other, than digging is done by men at one
full spit or spade full, about nine to ten inches deep. The com
mon wages I pay to these girls is 10d. per day, and they did
the work in nineteen days, for one girl, which cost 15s. 10d. :
—an acre at the same rate, containing 4840 square yards, would
cost 21.4s. 4d., this is lls. 4d. per acre more than by men at
one spit, but I am satisfied that the superiority of the girls’
work is well worth the difference: I may add, that this being
the girls' first attempt with spades, I am persuaded that by
further practice they would in a short time do it for the men's
price, 33s. The girls work with quite light spades made for the
purpose, the best size for which I think to be 93 inches long,
8 inches broad, and weighing, with the light handle, about 44 lbs.

These inquiries were suggested                           by
                                         Col. Lambton; and Capt.
Everest has examined the subject with that accuracy and re
search, which, give promise                    of
                                   much valuable information from
the same quarter.      Capt. Everest has identified the principal
stations which Lacaille occupied       the course    inhis operations;           of
and has   clearly ascertained the house       Cape  Town where his
                                                                in

the northern extremity, were, from their proximity           very high                     to
mountains, very unfit for such uice operations; and Capt. Everest
conceives that those immense masses                            of   rock must have had                   a

  sensible effect on the plumb line of the instrument.    Added to
  which, the whole plain, in which the measurement was effected,
  was also unfit for such a purpose, except with instruments which
  have been employed at much later periods.        From these and
 other causes Capt. Everest thinks that this celebrated measure
 ment ought not be considered (without a more recent corrobo
 ration) as sufficient evidence of an inequality in the two hemi
 spheres of our globe.     We have no doubt this subject will en
 gage the attention of our astronomer at the new observatory in
 that country.        -
    Some new    instruments,  of a peculiar mechanism, were exhi
 bited to the members    present.                                                                                -
    The next meeting of the Society (which will be the last of the
 present sessions) will take place on Friday, June 14, at 8 o’clock
 in the evening.
    [In our last account of the proceedings of this Society, we re
 marked that Sir Thomas Brisbane had observed, at sea, an oc
 cultation of Mercury by the Moon. We apprehend this must
 have been a mistake in the paper transmitted to the Society, as
 Mercury was not (at the period alluded to) in such a situation
 as to admit of his being occulted.      It was probably Regulus
 that was occulted: and that the transcriber had inadvertently
 written the name of the planet, instead of the star.]

    At the monthly meeting of this Society, which was held on
 the 17th of September 1821, His Excellency the Lieutenant Go
 vernor in the chair, the following paper by Lieut. Col. Wright
 was read:                                            -                                        -
      Observations on the Barometer as applicable to the Island
                                                           -                    -
                                          of Ceylon.                                                        -
      The scale of variation in the Barometer being of a very limite
nature between the tropics, compared with that of latitudes at a
greater distance from the equator, makes that valuable instru
ment, in general, be considered, especially by superficial ob
servers, as of little service in the former case; yet there is no
doubt but by an attentive and careful observation it may be made
subservient to many useful purposes, and become in the hands
of the agriculturist and navigator an equally valuable instrument
even in low latitudes.     It is only necessary to know     scale and               its
 of its                                                                                    in as an

 dered as applying to Barometers on board the ships in the roads
 and off the coast, as the difference probably is very trifling be
tween those and Barometers on shore and near the sea coast on

 a low elevation.
    No sensible difference has hitherto been observed in the Ba
 rometer on the western and eastern sides of the island; for, at
 the time of a gale of wind on the western side, during the south
west thonsoon, the same changes occur in the rise and fall of the
 mercury on the eastern side, and vice versá.
    In the city of Kandy situated at the distance of about eighty
miles inland, and at a computed elevation of about 2500 feet
 above the level of the sea, during the month of October, the
 maximum of the Barometer, while the Thermometer was at 76°
of Fahrenheit, was 28.452 inches, and the minimum while
 the Thermometer was 70° was 28.272.           Sufficient observations
 have not as    yet been made to determine with accuracy the ge
 neral average height, but it may be considered as about 28.3
 inches; and similar to what occurs at Colombo, it is always
higher in the morning about nine o'clock, and at night, than at
 the hour of three.     In fact, this periodical rise and fall of the
mercury appears of so fixed and established a nature, that, there
is no doubt, an attentive observer of the Barometer may thereby
 mark the above hours and intervals of time with very tolerable
 accuracy, where the state of the atmosphere and the weather has,
not during the time of observation undergone any very material
 change.
    The following additional remarks and observations on the
 Barometer, though not applicable to this island, may notwith
standing be deemed not unworthy of a place in the Transactions
 of the Ceylon Literary Society.
    At the Mauritius or Isle of France, in the month of January
 1819, the mercury in the Barometer falling to 29.10 inches,
was followed by a very violent hurricane, and as the gale abated,
 the mercury again gradually rose and continued rising till it
 reached 29.80 inches, the Thermometer of Fahrenheit during
 the time of the gale varying from 75 to 81 degrees.
    At the town of Port Louis in the month of February, being
the middle of summer, while the average height of Fahrenheit's
Thermometer       was 86°, that of the Barometer was 27.7% in
French inches and lines;     the English foot being to the French
as 12 is to 12.816.
   At Madras in the month of October 1818, the mercury in the
Barometer fell to 28.78 inches, which was considered as umpre
cedented at that place, and was followed by a very violent gale
of wind, which gradually abated as the mercury continued to
rise until it reached the height of 29.8 inches, which it had been
                                                                    at,

                On Motion in vertebrated Animals.                                389
at the previous part of the day. The Thermometer during the
time of the gale was in general about 74 degrees: and at the
same place in the month of May 1820, the mercury fell
                                                                eight
tenths of an inch below the height which         usually  indicated a
gale of wind, and was accompanied by a very heavy gale and
an unusual fall of rain.
    Off the Cape of Good Hope, the mercury in the Barometer
falling down to 29.60 inches is almost invariably the prognostic
of a storm—the usual average height is that of about 30 inches,
                                                               abates,
and to which height it again gradually rises as the gale
and continues at that elevation while the     weather   is serene  and
fair. A good Marine Barometer is there of absolute and essen
tial service, as these gales often come on suddenly without any
 remarkable change in the appearance of the heavens or atmo.
 sphere, but are invariably foretold by the Barometer.      It is how
 ever to be observed, that the steady     strong  breezes almost ap
 proaching to a gale, and which blow there from the south-east in
 the summer season, have a tendency to raise instead of sinking the
 mercury.    In that latitude it is not ascertained if the periodical
changes already alluded to take place the same as at Ceylon,
though probably not, as that very extraordinary and unaccount
able circumstance appears to be confined to the tropics and
equatorial region. The mercury there has been observed during
the month of May to rise to the height of 30.4 inches
                                                         nearly,
but the average height may- be considered, as above  stated, 30
inches in general.

along the whole length of the back.         The peculiar mechanisin
by which the spine is rendered capable of answering a variety of
importa t purposes in the animal system, was fully explained;
and the several modifications of structure pointed out, which it
receives in different tribes, in order to adapt it to the circum-            .
stances in which they are placed, and to the various intentions of
their formation       The system of organs by which the locomotion
of the  body  is effected, was next considered, in the relation which
they bear to the element on which they are exerted.
   As aquatic animals present the simplest mechanical conditions
with reterence to locomotion, Dr. Roget began with the ex
amination of this function in fishes. He observed that the buoy
ant force of the fluid which surrounded them, by counteracting
nearly the whole of the force of gravity, superseded the necessity
of limbs for the support of the body, which land animals require;
and that the progress of a fish in the water is effected principally
by the muscular action of the tail, which, giving powerful lateral
strokes, impels the animal forward on the same principle that
a boat is moved in sculling. The modifying and regulating pow
ers of the fins were next explained, and elucidated by diagrams
and drawings.       The hydrostatic principles on which fishes are
assisted in their ascent or descent in the water, by the dilatation
or compression of the air-bladder, were stated, and illustrated
by some experiments, in which similar effects were produced in
glass vessels immersed in water, but containing sufficient air to
enable them to rise to the surface, or sink to the bottom, accord
ing as the included air was made to expand, or contract.             The
air-bladder in fishes may be regarded as a refined apparatus in
the body of these animals, expressly accommodated to the laws
of hydrostatic pressure; and as furnishing one out of the many
instances that exist, where philosophical principles have been
applied, with manifest art and intention, for effecting a particu
lar purpose in the oeconomy. Those fishes which have no               air
bladder, as flat fish, have this want compensated by the great
size and power of motion in the pectoral fins, which enable
them to strike the water from above downwards with considera
ble force.   In the whale, and other animals of the cetaceous tribe,
the  body  is rendered specifically lighter by the large quantity of
oil  whichit   contains, and which    isespecially accumulated about
the head,   as  this part of  the body is  continually required    to   be
raised above the surface, for the purpose          ofrespiration.    The
various modes       ofprogressive motion employed,      byother aquatic
tribes, both   of reptiles and of mammalia, were also noticed.
    Dr. Roget    next  proceeded to  consider the mechanism      of  land
animals, beginning with serpents, and reptiles having short and
imperfect feet.      He showed the means      by which the former are
                                                                  enabled

    enabled to advance with various degrees of rapidity, and the ad
    vantages they derive from the position of their scales, and their
    connexion with the ribs.      The tortoise, the frog, the lizard, and
    various other animals of the same class, were noticed as forming
    links in the chain of gradation leading to the more perfect con
    formation, with reference to rapid progressive motion, which ob
    tains in warm-blooded quadrupeds.           In these, the body being
    raised   higher  on the limbs   enjoys   a  greater  range of motion,
    and   requires  a less frequent  repetition  of steps  in traversing an
    equal space.     The different  proportions    in which the weight of
    the body is sustained by the fore and hind extremities, the num
    ber of levers of which they are composed, their relative obliquity,
    the mode in which the muscular force is disposed, and the com
    binations of action which result, were severally explained.           A
    particular account was given of the paces of quadrupeds, such
    as walking, the trot, the gallop, the amble; the bounding of
    deer, the springing of beasts of prey, the undulating pace of the
    camelopard, and the peculiarities in the progression of animals
    formed for leaping, as the hare, the jerboa, and the kangaroo.
    A gradation was pointed out in the structure of the hind foot,
    which, in monkeys, makes the nearest approach to the human
    structure.     Dr. Roget observed, that the great features of                                di
    stinction between the mechanism of the huulan frame and that
    of quadrupeds, are derived from the former being adapted to the
    maintenance of the erect posture.     In man, the attitude of stand
    ing is a position of less security than it is in quadrupeds, and is
    maintained by a succession of actions by which the centre of
    gravity is perpetually shifted from side to side;        tendency        its                 to
    fall   in   any one direction being immediately counteracted                        by   small
    and insensible movements        the contrary direction.

 crossing the ice of the polar sea on sledges drawn by dogs, in
 search of the land said to have been discovered, in 1762, to the
 northward of the Kolyma.      He travelled directly north, eighty
 miles, without perceiving any thing but a field of interminable
 ice, the surface of which had now become so broken and un
 even, as to prevent a further prosecution of his journey.   He had
gone far enough, however, to ascertain that no such land could
 ever have been discovered.     The idle speculation, therefore, of
 the junction of Asia with North America, which we always re
jected as chimerical, may now be considered as finally set at rest.

new in the year 1648, from the mouth of the Kolyma to the gulf
of Anadyr, never,                 for

they gave the name of Engaño.           Holding a northerly course,
they reached lat. 57° 58', and then returned.
   Three years after these Spanish voyages, Cook reconnoitred
this coast more closely, and proceeded as high up as the Icy
Cape; it was subsequently visited by several English ships for
the purposes of trade; and though every portion of it was ex
plored with the greatest accuracy by that most excellent and
persevering navigator, Vancouver, as far as the head of Cook’s
Inlet, in lat. 61° 15'; yet, on the ground of priority of discovery,
it is sufficiently clear that England has no claim to territorial
possession.     On this principle, it would jointly belong to Russia
and Spain; but, on the same principle, Russia would be com
pletely excluded from any portion of it to the southward of 59°.
She has, however, been tacitly permitted to form an establish
ment, named Sitka, at the head of Norfolk Sound, in lat. 57°;
and this, apparently, must have tempted her to presume, that
no opposition would be offered to an extension of territory
down to the fifty-first degree of latitude, which includes   the                                              all

    that a minute description of it may here be dispensed with. The
    principle of               its
                    operation depends upon the geometrical doctrine
    of similar triangles; but the mechanical construction has under
    gone several modifications.             early form, the fulcrum, pen

nust  be properly done.       I have not seen a sufficient number of
the larger instruments to be able to speak positively on this point,
but I believe that in general the above requisites are not com
plied with.                 -         -                  -
   In a two-foot instrument of excellent   workmanship,    which now
lies before me, there is a scale of 100 parts on each bar; that is,
the space between the extreme marks ; and Tºr is divided into
 100 equal parts, zero being against the upper end.        The want
of principle manifested by this arrangement is obvious; for it
may be demonstrated that, whether the pencil be attached to the
long or to the short bar, that scale only which is adapted to it
ought to contain equal divisions; and the other, or scale for
the fulcrum, must be unequally graduated.         The scales, there
fore, on the instrument alluded to, are worse than useless, for
they may mislead the practitioner, in case he should forget the
fundamental rule, that in all cases the three operative points
must         right line.
             be   in    a
    When the ratio of reduction is greater than }, the pencil must
be attached to the long bar, and the fulcrum to the short one.
Again, when the ratio is not greater than }, it will be proper
that the pencil and fulcrum should change places.           Each of
these cases requires a distinct scale for each bar.
  The scales applicable to the first case, I shall call A, and their
divisions will be numbered in each bar from 100 to 50. Those
applicable to the second case, I shall call B, and they will be
numbered from 50 down to 8, or lower, if the mechanism will
admit of       though  it,
                        less ratio than-, 100

selves of the formulae and table here given, to lay down marks
on their bars as occasion may require; and in such case it would
be a preferable mode, instead of the tabular value, to take their
complements to 0-5, and to set off the distances from the lower

         their  discovery     nearly two  years,   for
                                                  when finding that
                                                              -    the

                   of Halkin Mountain, Flintshire.               407
  the stones at Flint mill were highly approved, and found to be
  a substitute for the French buhrs, they turned their attention to
  the subject.
     They were advised to lay specimens of the buhrs before the
  Society of Arts, &c. immediately, lest they might be anticipated
 by some other person in their pretensions to the premium offered,
 and they accordingly ventured to do so, in February 1820 <U+017F>un
 der the name of Flint Buhrs); but not having then had sufficient
  trial made of them, they were not in possession of certificates
 sufficiently extensive on which to rest their claims to the notice
                                                                   -
 of the Society.
     As, however, they are now able to adduce proofs that th
  Halkin buhrs are fully equal to the French, and in some cases
 are declared to be actually superior to them, they trust that the
 Society, in looking to the national importance of the discovery,
 will pass over the trouble that was last year so unintentionally
 occasioned, and again take the matter into their consideration.
     They request permission to lay before the Society the accom
 panying certificates and letters on the subject; and in order to
 show that they have not been selecting a few, and withholding
 any less favourable to their hopes, they beg to state the result of
 every sale made by them up to the end of the last year, and to
 add a short review of the particular certificate connected with
 each case, observing at the same time that not one unfavourable
 or unsatisfactory trial has yet occurred.
     Some of the buhrs got on the discovery of the quarry were (as
before stated) converted into mill-stones, and put up about three
 years ago at Mr. Evans's mill, in the borough of Flint, who cer
tifies that “he used them nearly two years occasionally for wheat,
but chiefly as gray-stones, in which they excelled; that at first
he used them seldom for wheat, but afterwards more and more
frequently, as he found them answer the purpose; and, by way
of comparing them with the French stones, he took six measures
of wheat, and ground one-half on the Halkin stones, and one
half on the French stones; there was some very slight difference
in the flour, which was in favour of the French     ; but he did not
consider it as a fair trial, as the Halkin stones were not at the
time properly faced for wheat grinding, and if the French stones
had been faced as rough, the flour from them would not have
been better than the other.         Bread was made from the two
kinds of   flour, but no one could distinguish between the two.   He
then had the Halkin stones regularly faced and cracked as
French, and has found them ever since equal to the French
stones in every respect whatever.”
  - Others of the buhrs, got about the same time, were used more
cautiously by a millwright, who made a large pair of millstones
                                                                   of

   408           On the Porcelain Clay, and Buhr-stone
   of Halkin and French buhrs, fixed in alternately, and these were
  set up more than three years ago at the Hornmills, near Dun
  ham-o'-th'-Hill, in Cheshire.          Mr. John Peers, the present
  tenant of this  mill, entered on it   nearly  three years ago, and he
  states that “the stones were in a      rough  state, and required six
  months to   get them to a    proper   face,  when they ground wheat
  as well as the best French    stones,   and have ever since continued
  to do so; that he prefers the Halkin and French stones (mixed)
  to those of French buhrs entirely, as they grind faster, and
  as well, and full as cool as the French; that he uses them for all
 purposes, and considers them equal in every respect, and superior
                                                                -
  in some respects to the French buhrs.”
     A large buhr   got about the same     time, was sold to Mr. John
 Edwards, the occupier of a small mill at Ysceifiog, in Flintshire;
 he states “that from various causes the buhr was not used till
 about twelve months ago, when he shaped it into a millstone of
 three feet six inches diameter; that he has no French stones,
 but used this as a runner over a blue stone for grinding wheat,
 and found the flour of good colour, and the bran broad and light;
 that the stone would bear the finest cracking, and continued to
 improve and harden till he left the mill in November last.”
     The next sale was to John Dumbell, Esq., of the Mersey Mills,
 Warrington (said to be the largest establishment in the kingdom,
 and containing twenty-two pair of mill-stones), and he certifies
 that “in March 1820 he received, a quantity of Halkin buhrs,
 which he had forthwith made into mill-stones, and these were so
much approved, that in May 1820 he had buhrs for a second pair;
that the two pair of Halkin millstones had been regularly at work
ever since, and continue to give great satisfaction to the bakers and
flour-dealers; that he conceives they are precisely the same kind
of stone as the French buhrs, and cut the grain like them, and
are like them in respect to oatmeal, in which neither French nor
 Halkin stones are used to advantage; and he considers the dis
covery of great national importance.”           Messrs. Hurstfield and
Passand (now the occupiers of some large mills at Lymm, near
Warrington, but who were lately foremen to Mr. Dumbell, and
have been practical millers nearly thirty years) state “that they
made the Halkin stones which were set up at the Mersey Mills,
where there are nine pair of French stones at work; that they made
an experiment with some wheat, by grinding some on the best
French pair, and some on the Halkin stones, in order to compare
the flour, in which there was scarcely any perceptible difference,
though the preference was given in favour of the Halkin stones
by a corn- and flour-dealer to whom the samples were shown;
that bread was made from each, but no difference could be per
ceived; that at first they thought the Halkin stones not quite
                                                                     So

so hard and tough as the French, but they found them continue
to improve, and to become as good as French; that they have
seen       all
          varieties    millstones, and made
                                   of            sorts    millstones,               all            of
but never saw    any buhrs     come    competitiontowith the French, in
except the Halkins, which they are satisfied will answer every
purpose.”                                                                                                         l

                                      Mirfield Low Mills, March 7, 1821.
       Sir, After having tried your Halkin buhr-stones, for a fair
    and sufficient time, we are now enabled to lay before you a can
    did and faithful report of their quality; and this we shall endea
    vour to do, with as much brevity as is consistent with the im
    portance of the subject.
       The perfection of grinding consists, in reducing grain to a                          re
    quisite degree of fineness, with the least pressure; or, in other
    words, to make the best and the greatest quantity of flour, out
    of a given quantity of wheat, with the least pressure. But, the
    mere good quality of a stone cannot effect this; for we must
    now call in the aid of art.   And here it is that the great art of
    a miller consists, the putting of work into stones, or the obliquity
    and disposition of the furrows, every thing else compared with
    this being only trifles.    And, indeed, when we consider that an
    accurate knowledge of this is grounded upon the doctrine of cem
    tral forces, which constitutes an important branch of the New
    tonian philosophy, we need not wonder that so few understand
    the real principles of corn grinding. We have, however, rea
    sons to believe that we have considerably improved                      it.
       From these observations         appears, that though the quality
                                            it
    of  the stones  may   be equally  good,  the effects produced will                       be
    different, according      as
                              the work      scientifically put
                                                  is                  other in    or
    wise; but,       the work and velocity                        the same, be
                                                        of of
                if                               the stones
      we  can clearly ascertain the quality      them       the effects pro
                                                                       by
    duced.
       We will now apply these observations       the stones     ques
                                                                  to              in
    tion. After twice     thrice
                          or      taking them up,  we were afraid that
    they would not stand the crack well; but this fear was soon
    dispelled, aswe now find that they wear exceedingly little, and
                                             as
                                        hair. We now proceeded                               to
                                   of as
    that the crack stands     fine           a

    obviously from the very first glance, that the bran produced from
    the Halkin buhrs was not only cleaner, but           more uniform cut;

        We selected the best French stones in the mill, made by the
    late Mr. Gardiner, of Liverpool, who was very famous for his
    knowledge of French buhrs; and, that the experiment might be
     the more accurate, we did not grind a quarter of wheat on each
     pair of stones, as it is impossible to part it from the wheat that
     precedes and succeeds with that degree of nicety that is required,
     without running the stones empty and thereby injuring them
     very considerably.    But we weighed 480 pounds of meal, ground
     by each pair of stones, from the same wheat, weighing 57 pounds
     the bushel.   These two parcels, after remaining a week, were
    weighed again, to see if any accession or diminution of weight
     had taken place; but the weights were precisely the same as
                                                                                      -

     and the result was as follows:

       Now, in this experiment, the velocity and work of the stones
    being the same, the quality of the buhrs may be as justly                                               in

LXXXIII.        Process   of preparing Saltpetre,    and Mode   of ma
                nufacturing Gunpowder, in Ceylon        *.
The preparing     of saltpetre, and the manufacture of gunpow
der, are arts which the Singalese, for many years, have constantly
practised.   The process of preparing the salt in different parts
of the country was very similar. When the salt occurred im
pregnating the surface of the rock, as in the cave near Memoora,
the surface was chipped off with small strong axes, and the
chippings by pounding were reduced to a state of powder. This
powder, or the loose fine earth, which, in most of the caves,
contained the saline impregnation, was well mixed with an equal
quantity of wood-ash.      The mixture was thrown on a filter
formed of matting, and washed with cold water.       The washings,
of the earth were collected in an earthen   vessel, and evaporated
at a boiling  temperature, till concentrated to that degree that a
drop let fall on a leaf became        a soft solid. The concentrated
 solution was set aside, and when it had crystallized, the whole
 was put on a filter of mat.    The mother-lye that passed through,
 still rich in saltpetre, was added to a fresh weak solution, to be
 evaporated again; and the crystals, after having been examined,
 and freed from any other crystals of a different form, were either
 immediately dried, or, if not sufficiently pure, redissolved and
crystallized afresh. The operations just described, were generally
 carried on at the nitre caves.        In the province of the Seven
 Korles, besides extracting the salt at the caves, the workmen
 brought a quantity of the earth to their houses, where keeping
 it under a shed protected from the wind and rain, without any
addition excepting a little wood-ash, they obtain from it every
 third year a fresh quantity of salt.
    In their mode of manufacturing gunpowder, which is very
generally understood, there is not the least refinement.          To
proportion the constituent parts, scales are used, but not weights.
The proportions commonly employed are five parts of saltpetre,
 and one of each of the other ingredients of sulphur and charcoal.
The charcoal preferred is made of the wood of the parwatta tree.
The ingredients moistened with very weak lime-water, and a
little of the acrid juice of the wild yam, are ground together
between two flat stones, or pounded in a rice mortar. After the
grinding or pounding is completed, the most seminated is col
lected, and carried in baskets to an adjoining stream, where            it,
                                                              by

    The smelting by a strong blast is injurious to metals that are
volatilizable by heat, as they have in this mode no protection
from the slag, which in reverberating furnaces floats on their
surface, and protects them from oxidation and evaporation. The

                                   Successful Result
   The nation has witnessed scenes of great distress during the years
of scarcity; but these bore no comparison to the present times.
   The hope of the privations being temporary, gave courage to
bear up against them : but now the future has nothing to invi
gorate exertion, or inspire fortitude.    Numbers are daily forced
into the ranks of  pauperism    against their will. Industrious ha
bits are destroyed, and with them that providence and fore
thought which is the basis of the happiness and respectability of
the working classes.     In order not only to continue in employ
ment the usual hands, but to extend it to the employing of others,
at a season when the active labours of the year are nearly closed,
I determined on undertaking the re-drainage of Walriggs, a field
of eighty acres, which had been drained about 18 years before,
in a manner then considered to be effectual.                      i
   The main-drains, as far as they go, were well done, and these
have been made available in many instances in the present
drainage.    They           all
                       run into the ditches which surround the
whole, from which there          considerable fall
                                       is   a           every side            on                        of
the field.  The collateral drains were     only   twenty inches deep,
set with three stones,            in
                             the form        triangle,   of
                                                        having aabout
eight inches     cover upon the top.

                                           that was aimed at, was

effectually, the drain must reach the stratum where the wet rests.
   The importance         deep ploughing was not heretofore known,
                             of
or  provided for.
   Five years ago this field was deep ploughed;            had been fore      it
seen, that   in many instances the plough was likely              come                  to              in
contact with the head           the drains: this did happen, and the
                                    of
consequence has been               to
                             render the land        wet,     nearly so,

inches at the bottom.      The drains have a cavity at the bottom
of six  inches, being  set with two side stones, and a cover, and
then filled with stones to the top, the six inches next the top
being filled with small stones, that in case the plough should
strike into them, no injury is done to the drain. The drains
are thus filled to within ten inches of the surface.     It required
a solid   yard of stone to fill a rood of seven   yards;  in weight
above two tons.

small difficulty, and could not have been executed in the time,
had not other substitutes been found.        In coal countries there
are strata known by the name of sill or schistus, and rattler,
which is a mixture of coal and schistus.     Sill is a substance that
will not bear   exposure  to the  atmosphere,    but rattler does not
fall, and is very light in comparison to      bulk.                               its

per acre ; sown with wheat and clover; both these crops were
admirable.      The oats this last year are calculated to produce
60 Winchester bushels per acre; it is now preparing for green.

fifty pounds: calculating it to yield three Winchester bushels per
acre more of wheat, at 7s. per bushel, this would be fifty-two
pounds ten shillings and ten-pence per acre; for the clover for
two years 50l. more, making a probable increase of produce,

immediately followed by any eruption of the volcanoes in Italy,
excited apprehensions of violent volcanic phaenomena in Iceland;
and in the month of March, letters were received in Copenhagen
from which the following account is drawn up. ,
    In the beginning of the month of September, the frost began
on the east coast, and on the east part of the north coast of
Iceland, with a violence that was quite unexpected after the ex
perience of the preceding years.    An amazing quantity of snow
fell, and the Greenland ice surrounded the whole east and north
coast, accompanied as usual by continual snow and frost.       It was
remarkable that the fine weather continued on the south coast
of the island till the beginning of November, the lowest state of
the thermometer at Naess, near Reikiavig, being on the 23d and
24th of September = 41°Fahr. On the 19th of October it sud
denly fell to 23°Fahr., which lasted, however, only for one day,
and before and after that time the temperature of the atmosphere
was constantly above the freezing point, until on the first of
November, when constant frost began.
   The island, though frequently alarmed by earthquakes, had
experienced no volcanic eruption since that famous one of 1783
and 1784 fom the Skaptaa-Jokkul, which destroyed such a great
part of the cultivated lands, except some small eruptions which
were said to have taken place in the interior, far from the inha
bited part of the island, and which passed away without attract
ing further notice, when in December 1821, a new crater was
suddenly formed on the Eyafjeld-Jokkul, a mountain of which,
among the numerous volcanic eruptions, only a single one is
mentioned, in the year 1612, when a great part of the ice of the
mountain burst, and was thrown into the sea.
    The Eyafjeld-Jokkul (known among sailors under the name
of Cape Hekla) is the highest of         the mountains all  Iceland;               in

over the village.    At the same time, a number of stones of dif
ferent sizes slipped down the mountain, accompanied by a noise
like thunder; no real earthquake, however, was felt. After this,
a prodigiously high column of flame rose from the crater, which
illumined the whole country round so completely, that the
people in the house at Holt could see as perfectly at night as in
the day time.     At the same time much ashes, stones, gravel,
and large half-melted pieces of the rock, were thrown about,
some of which amounted to the weight of 50 pounds.           In the
following days, and until the new year commenced, a great
quantity of fine powder of pumice fell in the surrounding country
according to the direction of the wind, so that a thick bed of it
covered the fields.    It resembled the falling of snow, and pene
trated through         all

   “On Wednesday, December 19, at twilight, and later in the
evening, a reddish light appeared on the E., which was the more
surprising, as it was clear.
   Dec. 20.-At one o’clock in the afternoon, a number of rather
shining clouds was seen collected about the top of the mountain
above Eyafjeld-Jokkul,     E.S.E. from Odde; the clouds soon
changed into a high column of smoke increasing in thickness and
darkness.    Though the weather was clear and calm, the smoke
was carried to the south; at sunset, the eruption seemed to
cease, but the smoke soon rose again, and even more violently
than before.    When it was dark, we clearly saw the moving and
the sparkling flame; from which we concluded that the eruption
must be violent.    Afterwards we heard that it was on the east
or south side of the Westerjokkul, near Hudnasten, and -opposite
to the farm-house of Skaale, in the parish of Holt.
   Dec. 21.-There was a violent storm, and the fire was ob
served varying in intensity; clouds of smoke rose with great vio
lence.   They remained on the mountain, and to the west of the
Jokkul, whose white brilliant colour was now destroyed by the
shower of ashes.
   Dec. 22.—The same phaenomena; the clouds increased, and
                                                                  -

stone and ice were going to fall together.  The greater part of
the ashes was fortunately carried towards the north, into unin
habited mountains and heaths, where also a great quantity of
pumice has fallen.”
   In another letter from the same Provost, dated Feb. 23, it is
said, “The clouds of smoke have not yet disappeared, and to
 day they are increased.      No ashes, however, have been observed
 during a long time, and the Jokkul has resumed            shining white          its
 colour,     so
            that the rain and wind must have removed the ashes.

                    very injurious to  Fruit Trees.             443
     Description.—Head     brown, margined behind with orange.
 Proboscis   short, pale  yellow,  spirally convoluted between the
palpi, which are large, subtriangular, yellow, the apex and mi
nute terminal joint black.        Antennae one-third the length of
the body, setaceous, not pectinate, brown, the first joint, which
is thicker than the rest, yellow.     Thorax brown, with two inter
rupted irregular transverse bars of orange.     Upper-wings brown,
beautifully variegated with many irregular streaks of orange, and
a few of silver.    The silver streaks are situate chiefly next the
margin: one just above the middle of the wing, anteriorly        di
viding into a fork, whose ends approach the margin; another
below the middle, extending in a curved direction nearly to the
apex, and sending off anteriorly two or three branches towards
the margin.     These silver lines are margined with orange, as are
two other short transverse silver lines near the inner angle of the
apex of the wing, which include a small silver spot, and two
longitudinal orange bars. Besides numerous orange streaks and
marks, which it is unnecessary to describe minutely, the wings
are characterized at the outer margins by about six short oblique
yellow spots. At the apex they are fringed with brown cilia,
which in some lights have a metallic shade, and are interrupted
by two longitudinal bars of yellow cilia.       Under-wings, above
wholly of a brownish black, except at the outer margin from the
base to the middle, where they are white.       At the apex they are
fringed with cilia, white at the apex, and circumscribed just
above the brown base with a very fine and almost imperceptible
white line. Under-side of the body and legs of a silvery or
pearly white; the tibiae and tarsi of the latter ringed with black.
Length of the body about one-third of an inch; of the wings,
when expanded, from half to three-quarters of an inch.
     Long as the above description may seem, it will not be deemed
too minute by any one acquainted with the difficulty of discri
minating many of the minuter species of this tribe of insects;
nor could I have contracted it consistently with the object I have
in view, that of enabling any gardener to recognise the moth in
question.
     How long these moths live after being excluded from the
chrysalis, I am not able to say; but from analogy, and the cir
cumstance that some which I reared under a glass jar did not
survive above a week, I conclude their term of existence does
not much exceed that period.          Hence, as I find them in my
garden from May to the middle of August, it is clear that they
are not, like many other insects, confined to one term of exclu
sion, but are issuing from the chrysalis throughout the whole
 summer: in greater number, however, in June than afterwards.
 In the day-time they usually remain sitting at rest on the trunks

    and branches of the trees from which they have emerged; flying
    about, like other moths, only in the night. The sexes, judging
    from those I reared under glass, copulate soon after their ex
     clusion from the chrysalis; and as the female, as remarked by
     Brahm, is not provided with any instrument for piercing the
    bark, it is probable that she deposits her eggs on the outside of
    it, the young larvae subsequently making their way into the tree.

made, and AR denote the apparent right ascension of the star on
the day of observation; then will t = (S-AR); noting always

        Friday, June 14.—Two papers were read from Mr. Gompertz:

     A paper was also read from Mr. Bevan on the practicability
 of  determining   the difference of longitude between two places
 not far distant from each other, by observing flashes of lightning.
 It seems to us, however, that the mode adopted on the Con
 timent, by firing loose gunpowder at certain intervals, is much
 preferable.
    A paper was likewise read from M. Littrow of Vienna, point
 ing out certain anomalies in the north polar distance of the
 principal fixed stars. It appears that the instruments recently
made by Reichenbach, for the observatories of Konigsberg,
Vienna, Gottingen, &c, give the north polar distances of those
stars greater, by 4 or 5 seconds, than the larger instruments at
 Greenwich, Dublin, Palermo, &c. This subject is one of great
interest at the present moment: and we wait, with much im
                                                         w
patience, the publication of this memoir.                         -
    The next and last     paper   was  by  Mr.  Babbage,   relative to a
new invention in machinery, by which not only the usual                                             lo
garithms, but also various other mathematical and astronomical
tables might be formed, and the types thereof set up without
the possibility of an error throughout the whole process.           This
discovery we consider as one of the finest in modern times; and
 (like the invention of the steam-engine in         application      the  its                  to
arts)    bids fair

                      evident that such series would enbrace not
only the common logarithms        numbers, the logarithms

whose ultimate differences were constant: but that              would
form tables, not dependent         that law; and whose differences

ration of  ethiops    mineral, as being one which effects the com
bination immediately,     and in a more perfect manner than that
generally employed.      Put one part of sulphuret of potash into
a mortar, with three or four parts of running mercury; triturate
together, adding a little water by degrees, until the whole is                                  re
duced to a homogeneous black paste; then add flowers of sul
phur in equal quantity to the mercury employed, and mix the
whole by a short trituration. Then wash the whole; and filter
with repeated portions of water, till              all

 -                 CAPACITY OF THE GASES FOR CALORIC.
     J. H.   Mallet, secretary to the Academy of Lyons, announces, as
the result of some well contrived experiments, which he has pub
lished, that at the same temperature the particles of different
gases are at equal distances; that their molecules have different
volumes; and that the quantity of caloric which a gas can ad
mit depends on the space which separates the molecules.
                  on water-cEMENTs, MoRTAR, AND LIME.
  The following particulars              are extracted from the work of   M.
L. J. Vicat on this subject.
   Limestones vary greatly in quality.    Those which approach
to marble in purity, or consist almost entirely of carbonate of
lime, are called rich; those on the contrary are called meagre,
which contain notable portions of sand or silex, alumine and iron.
The former when burned, slacked, and made into paste, will re
tain their softness for ages under water, or excluded from the air;
 but exposed to the air, they contract a remarkable hardness by
 the double effect of desiccation, and union with the carbonic acid
of the atmosphere. They even become susceptible of a beautiful
polish.
     But the meagre limestones, in general, treated in the same
manner, if kept under water, harden in a few days, and at length
form a kind of freestone which could be acted upon or broken
only by the pickaxe.      Exposed to the air, it acquires a crumbly
consistence, and will never admit of polish.         From this circum
stance, the lime which possesses the quality last mentioned is
called hydraulic lime.      But some of the meagre limestones are
unfit for hydraulic purposes, especially those which contain large
particles of silex.
    Puzzolanas are either natural or artificial. The natural is
found in situations which have been acted upon by subterraneous
heat. They          all
                   consist         of
                              silex, alumine, oxide          ofiron, and   a
little lime, the properties     which vary greatly.

 phuric acid, and abandon the silex, which immediately subsides.      +
 Others resist the action   of this acid.
    If we mix in various proportions, very rich lime slacked in the
usual way, with sand alone, or with puzzolana which resists the
 action of sulphuric acid, we obtain a mortar, which, placed under
 pure water, remains always soft, or acquires, after a long time,
only a feeble consistence.      The same mortar exposed to the air,"
soon hardens by drying, but is always easily broken or pulverized.
    But if the same experiment is made with a puzzolana readily
affected and decomposed by sulphuric acid, a mortar is obtained,
which soon sets under water, and becomes gradually harder, but
in air it does not acquire any great resistance in consequence of
its drying too rapidly.
    Hydraulic lime presents phenomena nearly the reverse. That.
is to say, it furnishes good mortar when combined with sand
alone, or with puzzolana unaffected by acids, whilst very unsa
tisfactory results are obtained by employing it with substances
which unite well with rich or pure lime.                              -
    Since the quality of natural hydraulic lime depends only on
the presence of a certain quantity of clay or argill combined by,
heat with calcareous matter, it is natural to suppose that in
mixing clay in suitable proportions with a rich slacked lime, and
submitting the mixture to heat, the same result might be ob
tained. Experiments made upon a large scale, and in various,
places, have confirmed this opinion so fully, that it is now
possible to fabricate almost every where, and at a very moderate
price, artificial lime superior to the natural.
                 Electro-MAGNETic ExPERIMENT.
   The discovery of M. Zamboni concerning the electricity pro
duced by the contact of a single solid conductor with a single fluid
conductor has been eonfirmed by Professor Oersted of Copenha
gen, who thus expresses himself in a letter on the subject:
    “You know that such experiments are extremely delicate; ,
they seem to have been repeated only by Mr. Erman, and this.
celebrated and ingenious philosopher complains much of the        ir
regularities which the experiments present.      I have found in the
electro-magnetic multiplier, invented by Schweigger, a mode of
making these experiments with the greatest ease.          I take two.
plates of zine, of different breadths, one for example 3 lines
broad, the other 14; I place them in a diluted acid, and I make
a communication between each of them and one of the extre
mities of the metallic wire of the multiplier. The action is thus
rendered very sensible.     The wider plate assumes in this galvanic
arc the  place of the  copper, the narrower that of the zinc. When
we take two plates which are -perfectly equal, and attach them
                                                                   to

herd of swine dispersed, and the wolf no longer to be seen. On
.
riding up to the spot, the wolf was discovered dead on the ground,
a rent being made in his side, more than a foot in length ;-the
boar having, no doubt, seized a favourable opportunity, and
      a sudden plunge dispatched his adversary with his formidable
tusks.

      is a little remarkable that the ancient Romans, among the
various methods they devised for drawing up their armies in bat
tle, had one exactly resembling the position assumed by the
swine above mentioned.       The mode of attack they called the

   The nidification in this country of the Parus Ptarmicus has
long been a subject of doubt with ornithologists: this season has
brought the hidden subject to light through the exertions and
perseverance of that indefatigable naturalist and bird-preserver,
Mr. W. D. Ayers: the nest was placed about eighteen inches
from the surface of the water, and composed principally of de
cayed summits of Arundo Phragmitis, and other aquatic plants;
it was supported by a number of plants,         curiously   entwined,
forming a very permanent support.
                            NEW COMET.
   A new comet was seen by M. Pons (of Marlia) on the 14th of
May, in the constellation Auriga. Its course was northerly, and
when last seen was near S Aurigae.     It was equal to a star of
the 4th magnitude : and it is somewhat singular that it has not
yet been seen in this country.  In fact, we cannot learn that it
has yet been seen by any one except the original discoverer. It
may be proper, to add that this comet is not the one which was
expected to appear this year, as it is going in a contrary            di
rection.
 The Journal des Debats of the 20th May gives the following:
—“ M. Gambort jun., Adjunct Astronomer at Marseilles, disco
vered on the 12th inst. a new comet in the vicinity of the
Second Star of Taurus. This comet was perceived yesterday at
the Royal Observatory in this city (Paris), and the result of the
observations which were made, showed that at forty minutes past
ten o'clock it had about 874 degrees of right ascension, and
36 degrees of boreal declension. The comet is at present              in
visible to the naked eye;    itsmucleus   is  small and brilliant;    its
atmosphere   of  little extent, and its tail scarcely perceptible.”

                          NEW COMPASS.                    -
    Mr. William Clark, a messenger in Chatham Dock-yard, has
invented    a mariner's compass on an entirely new principle.
The needle consists of four arms or poles, placed at right angles,
and uniting in one common centre. The two northern poles are
secured to the N.W. and N.E. and the two southern poles
to the S.F. and S.W. points of the card, which places the
 four cardinal points right between the angles of the needle,
 and allows the card to point north and south as heretofore, the
 cards now in use answering the purpose.        This compass has
been tried under different circumstances, and, as far as can be
 ascertained by the experiments already made, is allowed to pos
 sess the principles of polarity and stability beyond that of any
                                                   -

                 [From the New York Evening Post of April 10.]
   A curious invention in fire-arms has lately been accomplished
by an ingenious mechanic of this place, by the name of Isaiah -
Jennings; and in point of importance, both for public and private
use, it is probably not equalled by any invention of the present age.
It is a single barrel and lock, stocked in the usual manner, and
is perfectly simple, safe, and convenient. The number of charges
may be extended to fifteen or even twenty—each charge being
under as complete controul as a single charge in an ordinary
gun; and may be fired in the space of two seconds to a charge,
or at longer intervals, at the option of the possessor, with the
same accuracy and force as any other gun. The principle can be
 applied to any musket, rifle, fowling piece, or pistol, and can be
 made to fire from two to twelve times, without adding anything
                                                                                                          of its

    At the time when the desolating earthquake that occurred in
Zante in the end of 1820 took place, a remarkable circum
stance was observed just preceding, the shock.      Three or four
minutes   before, there was seen at the distance of two miles from
the point or promontory of Geraca, which is to the S.E. of the
island, a kind of meteor burning and almost swimming on the
sea, and which continued luminous five or six minutes.       At the
distance from which it was seen, it seemed to be five or six feet                    .
in diameter.    Could this he hydrogen gas emanating from some
volcanic submarine cavern, and which issuing out of the water
in an aériform column, sought to come in contact with the elec
tricity of the atmosphere?      This gas taking fire, continued to
burn till the inflammable matter was consumed.—Edin. Phil.

                          CANAL STEAM NAVIGATION.
   With a view to the introduction of steam vessels on canals, a
very interesting experiment was made in the Union Canal at
Edinburgh, on June 22, at two o'clock, with a large boat
28 feet long, constructed with an internal movement upon the
principle of a model invented by Mr. Wight, and exhibited to a
General Meeting of the Highland Society of Scotland in the
month of January last. A Committee appointed for the purpose
by the Directors of the Highland Society attended to witness the
experiment, and the Chairman and most of the members of the
Union Canal Company were also present. The boat had twenty
six persons on board ; and although drawing fifteen inches of
water, she was propelled by only four men at the rate of between
four and five miles an hour, while the agitation of the water,
being confined entirely to the centre of the canal, was observed
to subside long before it reached the banks, and consequently ob
