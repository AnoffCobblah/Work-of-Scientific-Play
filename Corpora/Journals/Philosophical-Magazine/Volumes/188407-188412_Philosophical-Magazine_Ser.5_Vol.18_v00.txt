   Notice to Contributors of Memoirs.—Authors are reminded that, under an
arrangement dating from 1871, the acceptance of Memoirs, and the days on which
 thev are to be read, are now, as far as possible, determined by Organizing Commit
tees for the several Sections before the beginning of the Meeting. It has therefore
become necessary, in order to give an opportunity to the Committees of doing
justice to the several Communications, that each Author should prepare
an Abstract of his Memoir, of a length suitable for insertion in the pub
lished Transactions of the Association, and the Council request that he will send
it, together with the original Memoir, by book-post, on or before July 21,
addressed thus:—" General Secretaries, British Association, 22 Albemarle Street,
London, W. For Section                        " On the present occasion, however, it
may not be possible in all cases to furnish Authors whose Papers are accepted
before the Meeting with printed copies of their Reports or Abstracts. If it should
be inconvenient to the Author that his Paper should be read on any particular
days, he is requested to send information thereofto the Seciietaiiies in a sepa
rate note.
   Rejwrts on the Progress of Science, and of Researches intrusted to Individuals
or Committees, must be forwarded to the Secretary, for presentation to the
Organizing Committees, accompanied by a statement whether the Author will
be present at the Annual Meeting.
   No Report, Paper, or Abstract can be inserted in the Deport of the Associa-
tiouLunless it is in the hands of the Secretary before the conclusion of the Meeting.

I. The Periodic Law, as illustrated by certain Physical Pro
   perties of Inorganic Compounds. By Thomas Carnelley,
   D.Sc, Professor of Chemistry in University College,
   Dundee*.
                             [Plate I.]
THE object of the present paper is :—(1) To illustrate the
       truth of the Periodic Law by means of the melting-
and boiling-points and heats of formation of the halogen com
 pounds of the elements. (2) To apply the facts thus obtained
to the calculation of unknown melting- and boiling-points.
 (3) To show how a knowledge of the melting- and boiling-
 points of the compounds of an element may be used for the
 determination of its atomic weight, when the application of
 the methods of specific heat and vapour-density do not give
 satisfactory results. (4) To show how the position of an
 element in the general classification may be inferred from
 the known melting- and boiling-points of its compounds.
    It is only within the last few years that the number of
 melting- and boiling-points determined for inorganic com
pounds has rendered it possible to draw any conclusions as to
the laws which govern them. This has been chiefly due to
the difficulty of determining the melting- and boiling-points
of bodies which fuse or boil only at temperatures which are
beyond the range of an ordinary thermometer. This difficulty
                   * Communicated by the Author.

 2             Prof. T. Carnelley on the Periodic Law.
 has now, however, been in great part removed ; for in several
 previous papers (Journ. Chem. Soc. xxix. p. 493, xxxiii.
 pp. 273 and 283*, xxxv. p. 564*, xxxvii. p. 125*) methods
 have been proposed for determining both high melting- and
 high boiling-points.
              I. Illustration of the Periodic Law.
     The Periodic Law states:— (1) That the properties of the
 elements are a periodic function of their atomic weights ;
 (2) that the properties of the compounds of the elements are
 a periodic function of the atomic weights of their constituent
 elements.
     It is this second part of the law which we shall endeavour
 to illustrate. For this purpose wo shall make use of the
 melting- and boiling-points and heats of formation of the
 chlorides, bromides, and iodides of the elements. The term
 normal chloride, bromide, or iodide will be used to indicate
 halogen compounds of the form, represented thus:—LiCl,
 BeCI2, BC13, CCI4, NCI3, OClj, FCl, for members of Men-
 deljeffs second series. In all the tables the symbols given to
 still undiscovered elements are those proposed by Mcndeljeff in
 his memoir on the Periodic Law {Ann. Chem. Pharm. Suppl.
 1870-72, p. 151). In addition to the experimental values
 given in Table I. A, melting- and boiling-points (see Table IX.),
 calculated by a method to be presently explained, are also
 inserted in the tables, in order that the latter may be as com
 plete as possible. In all cases the heat of formation given is
 the heat evolved by the combination of one atom of CI or its
 equivalent.
    Now, however we may arrange the melting-points, boiling-
 points, or heats of formation of the normal halogen compounds
 of the elements, provided only that we arrange them systema
 tically, we always find that certain definite and regular relations
 may be traced between them. Some of the more important
 of these relations are as follows f:—
    Relation 1. If the elements be arranged in the order of
their atomic weights, then the melting-points, boiling-jjoints, and
heats offormation of their halogen compounds rise andfallperio
dically. These periods correspond exactly with the series of
elements in Table I. J, the maxima occurring at the positive and
the minima at the negative end of each series. The exceptions
   * In conjunction with Prof. Carleton-Williams.
   t Throughout this paper all temperatures are reckoned from the absolute
zero (-273° C).
   \ Table I. represents the natural classification of the elements according
to Mendeljeff's arrangement, and is given here for reference.

to this rale occur either at the maxima or at the minima (i. e.
at the turning-points) of Meyer's curve of the elements {Mod.
 Theor. der Chem.~), or, in other words, with the tetrad elements
C, Si, Ti, &c, or the positive monad elements Rb, Ag, and Cs.
And further, the odd tetrad elements, when they are exceptions,
always have a lower melting-point or boiling-point, whilst
the even tetrad elements have a higher melting- or boiling-point
than would be required by the rule. These instances, there
fore, must be looked upon, not as exceptional, but rather as
confirming the truth of the Periodic Law ; for they themselves
occur regularly and periodically.
    The above facts are illustrated by Table II., which exhibits
the values for the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of the
elements from Li to Ti. In the first column the elements
are arranged according to the size of their atomic weights ;
in the second, third, and fourth columns are given the melting-
points, boiling-points, and heats of formation of the chlorides,
and in the following columns those of the corresponding

shown in the diagram (Plate I.), in which the melting-points of
the halogen compounds are represented by the ordinates, and
the atomic weights of the positive elements by the abscissae.

  of each sei'ies (the difference between which is comparatively
  small) to the third member, there is a sudden drop in both
  melting-point and boiling-point ; ichilst, on passing from the
  third on to the seventh, the decrease is far more gradual. (See
  Table II. and Plate I.)
     Relation 3. (a) For the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and
  seventh groups of elements, the melting-point and boiling-point
  increase as we pass from the chloride to the bromide and thence
  to the iodide.
     (b) For the even members of the first and second groups, the
  opposite relation holds good.
     (c) In all cases the Iteat of formation diminishes from
  chlorides to iodides.
     For illustration of the above, see Table II. and Plate I.; also
  Table III., in which are arranged the elements belonging to the
  fourth, or carbon-group. The even members of the group are
  printed in ordinary and the odd members in black figures.
  According to Mendeljeff, it is only the odd members which
  can be strictly compared with the odd, or the even members
  with the even, and not the odd members with the even ; and
  tbis, as will be seen, is fully borne out by a comparison of
  their melting- and boiling-points.

tions and do not obey the rules. This is a very small number
of exceptions, and especially so if we bear in mind the fol
 lowing considerations :—
    (1) The numbers obtained by different observers for the
 melting-point or boiling-point of one and the same substance
vary somewhat in many cases, and considerably in some few.
 Consequently it is probable that many of the above exceptions
are due to errors in the experimental melting-points and
boiling-points.
    (2) Several of the experimental values are somewhat un
certain, as is the case with the boiling-point of SC12 as found
by Dumas and the boiling-point of NC13 as found by Pelouze
 and Frcmy ; whilst it is probable that some of the com
 pounds, the boiling-points of which have been determined,
 boil under ordinary circumstances with slight decomposition,
 which would of course produce a corresponding error in the
 boiling-point. This is the case with CBr4 and some others.
    (3) The boiling-points of several of the compounds have
 only been determined within certain limits, and yet the means
of these limits have been employed in the construction of the
tables, and these would of course produce corresponding,
though small, errors.
    (4) Most of the above exceptions, however, may be ascribed
   * The differences in the second column at these points do not follow
exactly the order of size. It is easily seen, however, tliat they are so very
close together that slight errors in the atomic weights used (viz. P = 31,
Sb = 122, As = 75,Bi = 210, Cl = 3o-5, Br=80, 1 = 127) might easily affect
the arrangement, as the following atomic-weight determinations show :—
Bi=208 (Schneider), 210 (Dumas) ; Sb=120 (Schneider), 122-5 (Dexter),
122 (Dumas), 122-3 (Kessler), 120 (Unger), 120 (Cooke).

to the fact that, though the method to be presently described
of calculating melting-points and boiling-points does not
give definite points, but only limits between which the true
melting-point or boiling-point will lie, yet in the construction
of the tables the mean only of these has been used in order to
avoid complication.
    (5) No less than 73 out of the above 180 exceptions are
due to the melting-point or boiling-point of the following
eight substances being too high or too low :—CBr4 and A1C13,
the melting-points of which are too bigh ; All3*, SrBr2, Srl2,
and PI3, the melting-points of which are too low ; Asl3, the
 boiling-point of which is too high ; and Snl4, A1I3*, and PI3,
 the boiling-points of which are too low. It is intended to
 re-determine at the earliest opportunity the melting-points and
 boiling-points of these compounds, and especially to observe
 whether they melt or boil with decomposition or not.
 General Conclusions to be drawn from the above twelve Relations
        as to the Laws which govern the Melting- and Boiling-
        Points and Heats of Formation of the Normal Halogen
        Compounds of the Elements.
     I. If in a series of binary nwmal compounds one of the
 elements be common to all, then the melting-points, boiling-
points, and heats of formation are periodic functions of the
 atomic weight of the other element.
     See Table II. and Plate I.
     II. The influence of the halogen on these same three physical
 properties increases with the number of its atoms in the compound.
     Thus :—
                       Melting-point.                 Melting-point
              PBr3 = 252                     SiBr4 = 260
              PC13 = 200                     SiCl4 = _205
                              52 .                           55
      Here the difference between the melting-points of the com
  pounds containing four atoms of halogen is greater than
  between those of the compounds containing only three.
  (Compare also Relation 6.)
      III. In any normal halogen compound the influence of either
    * The numbers used for A1I3 in the construction of the tables of
  relations were those obtained b3' Doville and Troost, viz. melting-point
   = 125°, boiling-point = 350°. Since -writing the above I have found that
  Weber obtained the following :—melting-point = above 185°, boiling-
  point = above 350°, thus confirming the supposition that Deville and
  Troost's numbers are too low.

12          Prof. T. Carnelley on tlie Periodic Law.
of the elements on the melting- or boiling-point increases with its
own atomic weight and decreases with the atomic weight of the
other element. Thus :—
                     Melting-point.            Melting-jwint.
           PBr3 = 252°                 PBr3 - 252
           AsBr3 = 295                 PI3     = 328
    In each of the above pairs of compounds, which contain
one element in common, it is seen that the melting-point
increases with the atomic weight of the variable element, and
that whether the latter be the positive or negative constituent,
thus showing that the influence of an element on the melting-
point of one of its compounds increases with its own atomic
weight. The fact that the influence of an element on the
melting-point or boiling-point of its compounds increases with
its own atomic weight has been known for a long time with
regard to some few series of compounds ; but I am not aware
that it has been pointed out as of general application to all
the elements of Groups III. to VII. For the even members
of Groups I. and II. and for Na and Mg the influence is
always of the opposite kind.
    That the influence decreases with the atomic weight of the
other element is shown by the following examples :—
                   Melting-point.              Melting-point.
           PBr3    = 252               SbBr3 = 363
           PC13    = 200               SbCl3 = 345
                           52                         18
Here the substitution of Br for CI produces a larger increase
in the melting-point in the case of the P than in that of the
8b compound, the atomic weight of P being less than that
of Sb.
    Again :—
                    Melting-point.              Melting-point.
           SnBr4 = 303                  Snl4 = 419
           biBr4 = 260                  Sil4 = 393
                            43                        26
    As before, the substitution of Sn for Si produces a greater
influence on the melting-point in the case of the bromides,
i. e. where the atomic weight of the negative element is the
least. (Compare also Relations 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9.)
    Conclusion III. applies only to Groups III. to VII.
    IV. (a) Where the melting- or boiling-point or heat of
formation increases from chlorides to iodides, these physical

             Prof. T. Carnelley on the Periodic Law.            13
properties of the bromide are always less than the mean of
those of the chloride and iodide, thus :—
                                SbCl,.    SbBr3.    Sbl3.
          Melting-point     =   345°       363°     438°
   Mean of the melting-points of the chloride and iodide
= 391°.
   Whereas, when they decrease from chlorides to iodides, the
physical properties of the bromide are always greater than the
mean of those of the chloride and iodide, thus :—
                                NaCL       NaBr.     Nal.
         Melting-point = 1045°              981°     901°
   Mean of the melting-points of the chloride and iodide
 = 973°.
   (b) The melting- or boiling-points of the halogen com
pounds of the middle member of three consecutive elements
of the same group (proved only for Groups III. to VII.) are
always less than the mean of those of the other two, thus :—
                                PBr3.    AsBr3.    SbBr3.
          Boiling-point = 351°            444°      575°
   Mean of the boiling-points of PBr3 and SbBr3 =463°.
   From the above it follows that :—
   (1) The melting-point, boiling-point, and heat offormation of
a bromide are always nearer to those of the chloride than to those
of the iodide. (2) The melting- and boiling-points of the halogen
compounds of the middle member of three consecutive elements
of the same group are always nearer to those of the compounds
of the first member (i. e. the one with the lowest atomic weight)
than to those of the last member. This probably depends on
the fact that the atomic weight of Br is less than the mean of
those of CI and I ; and that the atomic weight of the middle
member of three consecutive elements of the same group is
always less than the mean of those of the other two elements;

   V. The melting-points of the halogen compounds of the
first and second groups are widely separated from those of
the other groups (see Relation 2 and Plate I.), there being,
in fact, a great jump from members of the third to those

of the first and second groups. In some cases, too, there
appear to exist relations between the melting-points of the
even members of these two groups different from those
which exist between the other groups. The compounds of the
elements usually placed in the odd division of the first and
second groups are generally altogether irregular. In the
case of the odd members of the first group this may be ex
plained to some extent by the fact that it is very uncertain
 whether Ag, Cu, and Au really belong to the same group as Na.
This was pointed out by Mendeljeff in his original memoir,
in which he places these metals provisionally in both the first
group along with Na, and in the eighth group along with
Fe, Pd, Pt, &c.
    II. Calculation of Melting- and Boiling- Points by
                    the Method of Limits.
   It will be readily seen that the relations referred to in the
foregoing pages may be made the basis of a method for cal
culating (within certain limits) melting- and boiling-points
which have not been experimentally determined. Thus, take
the case of the boiling-point of AsBr3. Supposing we know
the boiling-points of AsCl3 and Asl3, then, according to
Relation 3, the boiling-point of AsBr3 lies between those of
AsCl3 and Asl3 ; again, the boiling-point of As Br3, according
to Relation 4, lies between those of PBr3 and SbBr3. We
thus obtain a number of limits between which the boiling-
point of AsBr3 must lie ; and by selecting from all of them
the lowest superior and the highest inferior limit, we obtain
two limits between which the boiling-point of AsBr3 lies, and
these limits are generally very near together ; so that by pro
ceeding in this way we may calculate the melting- or boiling-
point of a substance within a very few degrees. Thus, if
x= the boiling-point of AsBr3, then
       By Relation 1,          x < 972, but > 331.

                            (ar-286) >22.
   We thus obtain no less than eighteen inferior and fifteen
superior limits for the boiling-point of AsI3r3, none of which
overlap ; and as of these the highest inferior limit =490 and
the lowest superior limit =498, therefore the boiling-point of
AsBr3 = (490-498)°, mean =494°. The boiling-point, as
found by experiment, =493°.

 16         Prof. T. Carnelley on the Periodic Law.
halogen compounds of the elements have been calculated.
The results obtained in the case of the bromides are given in
Table VIII. p. 15. In the few cases where overlapping limits
occur those limits are taken as correct, in favour of which
there are the greater number of limits, the others being
rejected.
   In this way it has been found that the average differences
of the calculated limits from the experimental values were :—
                                                         Per cent.
For the boiling-points of Groups Ili.-vu. = ± 4°'8 C, or 1*0
      „          „            „     i. &n.=± 4°-0         or 0-6
For the melting-points of Groups m.-VIl. = + 15o,0        or 4*2
      „          „            „     I. An. =+15°-0        or 1-8
   The size of the average error is due chiefly to exceptionally
great differences in but a few cases.
   For some compounds the number of inferior or superior
limits, or both, is very small; and therefore the error in
these instances is chiefly due to this source. It is to be
remarked that an error in any one of the data used in the
construction of the tables employed in the calculations may
produce a corresponding or even greater error in the calcu
lated melting-points or boiling-points of several other bodies.
Most of the errors in the above calculated values may be
ascribed therefore to errors in the experimental numbers of
but a very few substances. It must not be forgotten that all
the calculation really gives is the limits between which a sub
stance melts or boils, and not the exact melting- or boiling-
point.
   Calculation of Melting- and Boiling-points not yet experi
mentally determined.—By the method just described, a large
number of unknown melting- and boiling-points have been
calculated, and it is left to the future to decide whether these
predictions are correct or otherwise.
   In many cases the values have been calculated in two
ways :—(1) By using experimental data only ; (2) by using
both experimental and calculated data ; whilst for others the
experimental data are so few in number, that it has only been
possible to make the calculation by using both experimental
and calculated data. The results obtained are given in the
following table.

   3 Mendeljeff predicts (Liebig's Ann. Suppl. 1870-72, p. 202) that Ekasilicon
will boil somewhat below 373°.
   3 From this point onwards the values giion are only rough approximations.
    The melting-points and boiling-points which have been cal
culated for some of the substances cannot be determined in
the ordinary way, as they undergo decomposition below their
melting-point or boiling-point.

the exception of the chloride and bromide of tellurium, these
agree very well with the values calculated seven years ago.

III. and IV. Application of Melting- and Boiling-points
    to the Classification and Determination of the Atomic
    Weights of the Elements.
    The following example will show how a knowledge of the
melting-point or boiling-point of the normal chloride, bromide,
or iodide of any element may render considerable service in
the determination of its atomic weight, or for ascertaining its
position in the general classification. For this purpose we
will take Ti. Now supposing Ti were a new element, and
that its position and atomic weight were unknown; then, in
order to determine these latter, we should have to find its
equivalent and the melting-points and boiling-points (where
possible) of its halogen compounds, and then to collect together

             This table shows that Ti must occupy in the classification
          either the position assigned by Mendeljeff to the little inves
          tigated Yt (to the exclusion of this latter element), or that of
          the undiscovered element EkaSn, or, lastly, that which it
          really occupies; but it cannot belong to either of the first two
          positions, for neither do the experimental boiling-points of its
          bromide and iodide agree with those calculated for the first
          position, nor do the experimental melting-points and boiling-
          points of its chloride and bromide agree with those calculated
          for the second position; nor, again, does its equivalent agree
           with either of those which the first and second positions
          require. Consequently the only position which remains is that
           usually assigned to Ti; and this also agrees with its experi
           mental equivalent.
               Boisbaudran has found that gallium chloride melts at 348°"5.
           Taking this melting-point and the equivalent 23-3 as our only
           available data, and proceeding as described above in the case
           of Ti, we find that we must give to gallium the position of
           Eka-aluminium in MendeljetTs table. This is the position
           actually assigned to it for other reasons by Boisbaudran.
               There has recently been some dispute as to the atomic

             Prof. T. Carnelley on the Periodic Law.            21
 weight' of Be. From his determination of its specific heat,
 Emerson Reynolds (Phil. Mag. [5] iii. p. 38) concludes that
 its atomic weight is 9-2, and that it is a dyad; whilst Nilson
 and Pettersson (Deut. chem. Ges. Ber. xi. p. 381), also Hum-
 pidge (Phil. Trans.), from their determination of its specific
 heat, give to it the atomic weight 13*8, in which case it would
 be a triad. Now according to calculation the melting-points
 of its chloride, bromide, and iodide ought to bo (820-870),
 (802-820), and (766-777) respectively if it has the atomic
 weight 9-2; and although these numbers are somewhat uncer
 tain, from their having been calculated for an element of the
 second group (see Table IX.) occupying the position generally
 assigned to Be, yet they are sufficiently near in order to de
 termine whether Be is really a dyad or a triad. If it be a
 dyad, the melting-points of its halogen compounds must be
 considerably higher than those of boron (see Conclusion V.
 p. 13, also Plate); whereas if it be trivalent, these melting-
 points must be comparatively low. If the metal is a dyad,
 the melting-point of its chloride should also be higher than
 that of the bromide, and the latter higher than that of the
 iodide; whereas if it be a triad, the reverse should be the case.
    To throw light on this point, I determined as carefully
as possible the melting-points of the chloride and bromide of
 beryllium, and found that the chloride fuses between the
melting-points of Ag4P207 (melting-point = 858°) and NaP03
 (melting-point = 890°), thus agreeing with the number (820-
870) calculated for BeCl2 (Be = 9-2). The bromide also fuses
between 858-890, and almost exactly at the same tempera
 ture as the chloride, but, if any thing, slightly higher, the
calculated number for BeBr2 being 802-820. The rather
high number obtained for the bromide is probably due to the
substance being so readily volatile below its melting-point,
that the heat absorbed during its conversion into vapour
cools the remainder of the solid, and thus prevents it melting
so soon as it otherwise would do. BeBr2, however, is much
more easily volatile than BeCJ2. The chloride and bro
mide used for the determination of the melting-points were
the pure compounds obtained by repeatedly distilling the crude
substances, produced by passing chlorine and bromine respec
tively over a red-hot mixture of the oxide and charcoal.
   An analysis of the chloride gave:—

   Now, judging from available data, the normal chlorides of
all triad elements melt below 510° (BiCl3 being the highest
known, melting-point =503°), and their normal bromides
below 500° (BiBrs being the highest known, melting-point =
480°). These results therefore confirm the view that beryl
lium is a dyad, with atomic weight 9*2. This is rendered still
more evident by an inspection of the Plate, showing the
curves of the melting-points of the halogen compounds of the
elements*.
                                Fluorides.
   As fluorine is an even, whilst CI, Br, and I are odd members
of the seventh group, the fluorides cannot strictly be compared
with chlorides, bromides, and iodides as regards their melting-
and boiling-points. The melting-points and boiling-points of
the fluorides, however, taken apart from those of the other
halogens, appear (if we may judge from the few melting-
points and boiling-points which are known) to obey laws
similar to those which govern the melting-poiuts and boiling-
points of the chlorides, bromides, and iodides.

§ 232. TINTRODUCTION.—When, some ten years ago,
               the first experiments in this subject were brought
before the Physical Society, it was pointed out that the key to
the temperature of any salt-ice freezing-mixture was to be
found in the temperature of fusion of the cryohydrate of that
salt. Since then further light has been thrown upon the
subject by the discoveries and observations of others. Thus,
Ditto has obtained a hydrate (probably a subcryohydrate) of
hydrochloric acid, and Wroblewski has obtained a similar
hydrate of carbonic acid. Pettersson, in his exhaustive study
 of marine ice, made in the ' Vega ' expedition, has explicitly
admitted that the phenomena presented by freezing and frozen
 sea-water can only be satisfactorily explained by the formation
 and properties of the cryohydrates. Though this tacit corro-
   * Since writing the above, Messrs. Nilson and Pettersson (Deut. chem.
 Get. Ber. xvii. p. 987) have determined the vapour-density of beryllium
chloride, and find that it corresponds with the formula BeCla, and conse
quently that Be=9-2.

boration or explicit adoption by foreigners of the views I
ventured to advance has given me perhaps more satisfaction
than if they had been only accepted by English physicists, I
may be allowed to express some regret that the latter do not
yet appear to be awake to the interest and importance of the
subject. It gives me, therefore, unusual pleasure to offer them
this my eighth memoir on this branch of Molecuiar Physics.
   In this memoir I shall first make a study of the ammonia
group in its behaviour with water. I add a little to our
knowledge of ammonia itself in this respect                 Then are
examined the effects of replacing one or more of the hydrogen
equivalents by ethyl. Then will be described in some detail
the behaviour with water of some aniline salts.
   Secondly (§§ 249-255), I shall shift the region of my
inquiry upwards on the thermometric scale, and include in it
temperatures at which the solid fuses per se, and shall thus
establish the continuity of the phenomena of fusion with those
of solution, making clear the fact that certain bodies, originally
solid, may at high temperatures become miscible with water
in all proportions. It will be shown how this latter branch of
the inquiry, apart from its purely physical interest, has a great
geological one, as it throws light on the pyrohydration of
igneous formations, just as the cryohydration in floes has
thrown light on the formation of those masses.
   § 233. Ammonia.—Anhydrous ammonia, NH3, according
to Faraday becomes solid under a pressure of 20 atmospheres
at a temperature of — 75° C. According to Fourcroy and
Vauquelin, a perfectly saturated solution (? saturated at air-
temperature) freezes between —38° and — 41° C, forming
shining flexible needles ; at —49° C. it freezes to a grey
gelatinous mass.
   Starting with a 33 3-per-cent. solution, I made solutions of
various strengths, and found that pure ice separated from
them at the following temperatures :—

   Judging by the analogy, which will appear more clear in
the sequel, it seems that the body mentioned by Fourcroy is
a subcryohydrate, and that the gelatinous mass mentioned
still contained too little water for the cryohydrate. I find
that a 33-3-Der-cent. solution does not crystallize at — 80° C;
and I have as yet been unable to obtain the true cryohydrate.
    § 234. EthyUAmmonias.—The ammonias whose relation
ship to water have next to be described were obtained from
Kahlbaum of Berlin. They were verified by means of their
boiling-points, their platinum double chlorides, and by titration
with standard hydrochloric acid. Those which I here employ
were found to be pure.
    § 235. Ethylamine. Boils at 18°C—The solutions of this
base were made by dropping an indefinite quantity into
a narrow-necked weighed bottle, putting in the stopper,
weighing, surrounding by a freezing-mixture, and running
in the proper quantity of distilled water from a burette.
When the quantity of water was small, it was dropped in
from a capillary tube until the proper weight was reached.
   The first five solutions, namely those containing OIH), 5,
10, 15, and 20 percent, of ethyl-ammonia (NHgC,H5). showed,
on cooling, the separation of the easily recognizable ice-
crystals. On further cooling the 20-per-cent. solution, the
separating crystals became opaque, betraying the cryohy
drate ; this occurred at — 130,9, whereupon the temperature
became stationary. After ten or twelve grams had solidified
at — 130-9, the remaining liquid was poured into a fresh tube
and reduced to the same temperature. The same operation
having been performed three times, the liquid was considered
pure ; 3"589 grams of it were weighed in a stoppered bottle,
diluted with water, over-neutralized with hydrochloric acid,
evaporated in a water-bath in a platinum dish until the
chloride became quite hard on cooling, heated to incipient
volatilization, and weighed. There was thus obtained T3415
gram chloride of ethyl-ammonium or 0"7407 ethylamine, which
corresponds to 20*64 per cent.
    On cooling a stronger solution than this, solidification
begins at a higher temperature, reaches a maximum between
30 and 35 per cent., and again falls, passing out of the range
even of a solid carbonic-acid cryogen. As there is only one
tenth of a degree difference between the points of initial
solidification of the 30- and 35-per-cent. solutions, and guided
by the general shape of the curve, I made a 32'4-per-cent.
solution, and found that solidification began at — 8°C.
    It is well known that anhydrous ethylamine is not solidifiable
in a solid carbonic-acid cryogen. Accordingly, the solid w hich

                        and Attached Water.                        25
separates from an aqueous solution of ethylamine of any and
ever}' strength between — 13°-9 and the anhydride is one of
those remarkable bodies which I have called subcryohydrates,
and which have been observed in the chloride and iodide of
sodinm.
   The subcryohydrate of ethylamine, as a glance at the
curve (fig. 1) will show, has a solidifying-point within cer
tainly one tenth of a degree C. of — S , and, as certainly, it
has within two or three tenths of a per cent, the composition
of 32 "4 per cent. It is minutely crystalline, and of nearly the
same specific gravity as the residual liquid. Its solution is
eminently supersaturable, and in that state is curiously viscid.
It is not easy to see a way whereby it might be made to
purify itself in the act of formation. The existence of these
solid hydrates of a substance which by itself resists solidifi
cation by a carbonic-acid cryogen, and the fact that their
melting-points are only ten degrees or so below 0°C, is
surely an unanswerable argument that they are not mere
juxtapositions of independent crystals of the two constituents.
    Any horizontal line between — 13°*9 and —8° cuts the
curve of aqueous ethylamine in three places. Within these
limits, therefore, there are alwaj's three degrees of strength of
the solution, which begin to solidify at the same temperature.
 Thus, if we find an aqueous solution of ethylamine begin to
 solidify at —12°, we do not know whether it is of the strength
 18-7 or 22-2 or 43-3 per cent. Further, it may be noted that,
on adding water of the air-temperature to the solid subcryo
 hydrate, a depression of temperature occurs to a point lower
than that at which the subcryohydrate stood.

   § 236. Diethylamine.—Let us now replace another equivalent
of hydrogen by the same organic radical, and examine the
relation towards water of diethylamine, NH(CaH6)s. This
liquid boils at 54° (57°, Hofmann) at 31-02 B. The solutions
were prepared precisely as in the preceding case.
   The four weakest solutions, which contained 5, 10, 15, and
20 per cent, of base respectively, gave no trouble. But from
this point the curve (fig. 1) descends very sharply towards the
cryohydrate, and rises again with equal steepness. A 22-per
cent, solution yields ice on incipient solidification at 90,9; while
a solution containing only 1 per cent, more, a 23-per-cent.
solution, yields subcryohydrate at the same temperature of
9°'9. To this difficulty has to be added the circumstance that
I have not met with a substance which shows so extraordinary
an aptitude for supersaturation. The solutions of the sub
cryohydrate in the anhydrous base (all those to the right of
the cryohydrate in fig. 1) and the cryohydrate itself may be
cooled to —20°, and diligently stirred without showing signs
of solidification. The solidification may then be started by a
cryogen of solid carbonic acid and ether. Moreover, the solu
tions near the saturated conditions are as viscid as glycerine ;
so that the appeal from one part of the liquid to another in the
matter of crystallization, and consequent change of composition
of the residual liquid, is tardy. These circumstances made it
impossible to obtain the cryohydrate pure for analysis in the
ordinary way by automatic purification. But they also made
it unnecessary ; for since a 22 per cent, gives up ice and a
23 per cent, gives up subcryohydrate at the same temperature
(90,9), it follows that a 22-5-per-cent solution must, within a
probable error of about 0*2 per cent., have the composition of
the cryohydrate. Having made such a solution, and cooled
it to —10^ in a salt-ice cryogen, the bottom of the tube con
taining it was dipped in a little carbonic-acid cryogen until a
little white opaque regulus of crystals was formed. The whole
being then restored to the ice-salt cryogen and stirred, opaque
solidification began, the rounded tufts of crystals much re
sembling oatmeal in suspension. From first to last the tem
perature now remained constant at llo,0 C. Of course there
was no need to analyse a body thus synthesized.

     § 237. Triethylamine, N(C2HS)3. Boils at 88°.—Viewed
as an anhydride, we should expect, a priori, to find a greater
difference between the physical properties of this body and
those of diethylamine than between those of the latter body
and ethylamine. Indeed, the difference might be expected to
be comparable with that existing between the properties of
 ethylamine and those of ammonia ; for the replacement of the
 first and the last equivalent of hydrogen by ethyl would be
 expected to effect a difference of kind, while the replacement
 of two instead of one would effect rather an alteration in
degree. Be this as it may, the properties of triethylamine in
 reference to water are quite exceptional, or at least very
 remarkable. The solutions of strengths 5, 10, and 15 per
 cent, yielded ice ; the latter and the 20 per cent, can be
 employed for obtaining the cryohydrate, but the 20 per cent,
 begins its solidification with the subcryohydrate. The soli
 difying temperature of the cryohydrate is — 30,8 C. This
 cryohydrate contains 19*15 of the anhydrous base. It may be
 remarked that the hydrochloride of this base retains hydro
 chloric acid with such firmness that, even when heated to
incipient volatilization, it still remains acid *.
    * A few grains of chloride of triethyl-ammonium heated on a hot spatula
exhibit a beautiful phenomenon. The columns and whirls of white
smoke can be watched petrifying in the air to white soot without much
 change of form.

                Frederick Guthrie on Salt-Solutions
   The subcryohydrate of this body is, like those of the pre
viously examined ones, very prone to supersaturation ; so
that, in examining the richer solutions, it is advisable to have
recourse to the solids of previous preparations; which act like
a ferment. A nearly remelted tubeful of the subcryohydrate,
set to resolidify very slowly, crystallizes in bright laminae one
or two millimetres in diameter. More quickly frozen in repose,
crystalline masses an inch long are fashioned upon the glass.

   § 238. Triethylamine is one of those rare bodies which, like
sulphate of sodium, sulphate of calcium, caustic lime, and
a few others, are more soluble in cold than in hot water. The
behaviour of the three bodies named is clearly traceable to
the decomposition by heat of definite hydrates. Without
laying undue stress upon this, it seems that the phenomenon
in question is one of decomposition, which so often follows
increased temperature, and not an inversion of the rule that
solubility also increases with temperature. The body decom
posed in the case before us is clearly a hydrate—either the
cryo- or subcryohydrate. Accordingly, though striking in
its presentation, the phenomenon is really quite continuous
with the decomposition by heat of oil of vitriol ; which decom
position, I presume, does actually take place when that liquid
is heated above its boiling-point (in a closed vessel). But
while in the latter case the products of decomposition are
probably miscible, and mix, though held apart from chemical
union by heat-tension, with the hydrates of ethylamine the
products of thermal decomposition are separated not only
chemically but in mass, because, when chemically separated,
they are not molecularly miscible, at least in all proportions.

 at the same temperature at which it becomes turbid. A still
 more dilute solution, namely a 099 per cent., does not become
 turbid at 200° C, when it is heated in a sealed tube. The curve
 (fig. 1, " Triethylamine and Water as liquids ") shows the re
 lationship above examined. The following example illustrates
 the history of a solution. Ten grams of ethylamine and 90
 grams of water, shaken together at 25°, form a white emulsion.
 On standing at that temperature, two transparent layers are
 formed, of which the upper is ethylamine saturated at 25°
 with water, and the lower water saturated at 25° with ethyl
 amine. On heating to 28°, both layers become turbid ; the
 upper sheds water saturated at 28° with ethylamine, which falls,
  and the lower ethylamine saturated at 28° with water, which
  rises. These new quantities join their respective camps, the
 constitution of which has, of course, been altered by the

30              Frederick Guthrie on Salt-Solutions
 departures, and is now that of saturation at the new tempera
 ture in the two cases. The surface of demarcation shifts
 towards the centre of the mass. Similar effects follow further
 rises of temperature. Let now the lube cool. The former
 condition is reestablished. On further cooling, the surface of
 demarcation shifts—rises in this case as the two liquids mix
 more with one another. At 21°-3 perfect solution ensues,
 and this is well marked within a tenth of a degree. Just
above this temperature the mass is opalescent, just beneath it
 it is perfectly limpid. When at this critical temperature, the
 warmth of the hand only momentarily applied makes a wide
 test-tube of the limpid mixture quite milky. Nor can such
a test-tube be passed so nimbly through a flame as not
 to exhibit the same change. Following the temperature
downwards, we find the solution remains clear below 0°, until
 we reach — 2°, whereupon crystals of ice appear. These
increase with the falling temperature until — 3°-8 temperature
and 1(M percent, is reached. The cryohydrate now solidifies,
and no further percentage change is possible ; nor tempera
ture change, until solidification is complete.
    A 40-per-cent» ratio only shows perfect mixture at 18°"4.
It remains a mixture until — 5°*1, whereupon subcryohydrate
begins to appear in the solid form. Its quantity goes on in
creasing with lowering temperature until — 20o-6 is reached:
this marks an 80-per-cent. solution. At still lower tempera
tures no doubt the liquid becomes more enriched. If the
anhydrous liquid is nnsolidifiable by cold, then the ordinate at
100 percent, is asymptotic; but if, as is more likely, the liquid
is solidifiable, the remainder of the water and of the ethyl-
amine will unite to form some hydrate even lower than the
subcryohydrate at some very low but constant temperature.
An 80-per-cent. ratio at — 30° is thick with solid subcryo
hydrate. Perfect liquefaction takes place at — 20o,6. The
liquid remains clear until + 12° is reached. At and above
12 separation ensues, which increases with the increasing
temperature. The curve (fig. 1 , " Triethylamine and Water
as liquids") is virtually a straight line between 15 per cent,
and 50 per cent. The deviations are probably errors of obser
vation; and these errors of observation are certainly not due
to want of definition of the occurring and vanishing turbidity,
which is well marked within 0"025 of a degree. Nor are they
due to errors of original weighing or change during mani
pulation ; for the very flatness of the curve shows tliat a great
change of composition has little effect upon the temperature
of saturation. If they are indeed errors, they arise probably
from the collecting together of the opalescing globules into

                     and Attached Water.                      31
clear drops which separate down, leaving the liquid above as
clear as though it had been cleared by cold. The indication
from a gradually ascending temperature is accordingly more
to be relied on than one from a falling temperature.
   When water is added to trietbylamine, but little heat is
evolved. A very small rise in temperature occurs when the
30-per-cent. mixture is made. The constituents should be
brought to about 10°; and in the final experiment the thermo
meter and thin glass bulb, in which tbe mixture is effected, are
to be previously warmed fully to the temperature at which
                            Fig. 1.
they stood at the end of the previous experiment. It is pro
bable that the smallness of the heat of combination is nearly

32              Frederiok Guthrie on Salt-Solutions
connected with the ease of thermal separation. It is to be
noticed, moreover, that in the region of the lower curve about
the subcryohydrate, where the curve is flat because great
change of percentage makes little difference in temperature
of initial solidification, the curvature of the upper curve, fig. 1,
" Triethylamine and Water as liquids," is also nearly nothing.
Whether above or below zero, we are dealing apparently at
every individual percentage with the same substance, the sub
cryohydrate : it is this region which is so keenly sensitive to
changes of temperature.
   § 239. There is this important and essential difference be
tween the genesis of a cryohydrate and that of a subcryohy
drate. Solutions of nearly the cryohydrate strength approach
the composition of that body as they lose heat and sink in
temperature—weaker ones by the shedding of water (as ice),
stronger ones by the shedding of salt or subcryohydrate.
And this is true for all solutions from 0 per cent, up to the
strength of the subcryohydrate; that is, on the curve, to the
point where ^ changes sign.
   Not so with the subcryohydrate. A solution weaker than
the subcryohydrate, to the left of it on the figure, will " run
down " to the cryohydrate by dint of shedding the subcryo
hydrate. A solution stronger than the subcryohydrate will
" run down " to the solidifying-point of the anhydrous liquid
 or to that of some secondary cryohydrate, no example of
 which is, I think, yet known. In either case, the liquid resi
 due gets further and further away from the ratio in the sub-
 cryobydrate. The whole condition may be illustrated by the
 motion of a marble rolling upon the curve. It will run down
to the bottom of the valley of the cryohydrate wherever it is
placed on the slopes of that valley, and there remain in stable
equilibrium. But placed upon the top of the great swell of
the subcryohydrate, it will be at rest onlv if undisturbed, and
so be in instable equilibrium. It will, it disturbed, either roll
down to the bottom of the cryohydrate valley, or roll into the
 abyss of the anhydrous liquid. The cryohydrate is the level
of a lake. The subcryohydrate is the watershed (subcryo
 hydrate shed) of a hill-range.
    The cryohydrate being an eutectic alloy, the subcryo
hydrate is a definite chemical combination, existing probably
as such in the liquid when above zero, and liberating in
its formation the heat observed when the two liquids are
mixed; and as, for instance, sulphate of soda crystallizing
 either from an acid or alkalino solution leaves the liquid
more acid or more alkaline than before, so the subcryo

                      and Attached Water.                       33
hydrate in its solidification leaves the liquid from which it
separates continuously more aqueous or less aqueous ac
cording as it started from a solution more or less aqueous
than itself. The " more " and " less," as here employed, refer
of course to intensity, not to quantity, and the change is the
analogue of that suffered by electricity when the surface of a
conductor alters in size.
   § 240. Some Applications of the above Property of Triethyl-
amine.—It appears from Table XLIX. that one weight of tri-
ethylamino with 19 weights of water is a ratio requiring 34°
C, or 930-5 F., that is a low blood-heat, to effect its turbidity.
A ratio of 1 of ethylamine and 24*76 of water requires 41° C.
or 105o-8 F. for the same effect to be produced: this is a fever
heat. Accordingly, a few little glass capsules containing so
lutions of the triethylamine of strengths graduated between
these two and thereabouts, and containing also a little mer
cury to assist the stirring-up when shaken, may be
of use in the diagnosis of fever. The eye may be
fastened to a thread or rod, and so introduced be
neath the arm or into the cavities. I have made a
series of 9 such capsules, which show turbidity at F.
68°-3, 69°-4, 76°-l, 7!)°-9, 91°-4, 98°-6, 105°-2, 11P-2, 123°-8.
    § 241. The radiation from an electric arc passing into an
8-per-cent. solution will warm it to opacity. Thin strips of
variously coloured glass placed in such sohitions will deter
 mine the opalescence after various time lapses,—the red
 glass acting the slowest, and the others, speaking broadly,
the quicker the shorter the wave-length of the light they
 transmit. Two of complementary colour, which together ab
sorb all radiation, or a single black one, act the quickest.
 Coloured glasses placed between the solution and tie source of
 radiation cause opalescence in times which are the longer the
 shorter are the transmitted wave-lengths.
    A few drops of the solution placed as a thin film between
 two thin sheets of flat glass, and prevented from evaporation
by sulphur-cement around the edges, forms a sensitive plate.
The hand placed upon it leaves a white silhouette. The
spectrum thrown upon this plate leaves a transient record.
    It is probable that the heat liberated when triethylamine is
mixed with water is, if the expression may be allowed, the
 real image of the heat which on entering the mixture effects
 separation. They are both equal in quantity to the heat of
 subcryohydration ; the former being that heat itself. It is a
happy circumstance that the temperature at which separation
 begins within the limits of 20 to 50 per cent, solutions is a
 usual atmospheric temperature, namely 18°"3 C. (64°"94 F,).

   § 241a. The quantitative relationship in respect to solu
bility existing between water and triethylamine was deter
mined with considerable accuracy in the following manner.
A 50 c. c. burette graduated to two-tenths was sealed at one
end, and the mercury and water-meniscus values determined.
It was drawn out to a narrow neck, and received about 2 c.c.
of mercury. The whole being now counterpoised, a few c.c.
of ethylamine were introduced, which proved to weigh b'"8b"
grams. A few grams of water were next added, the end
sealed off and dried, and the whole reweighed. It was found
that 7*885 grams of water were present.
   The whole was now brought to a temperature low enough
to ensure perfect mixture, and then gradually heated in a
large beaker of water to which successive portions of warmer
water were added. The water was diligently stirred. When
the temperature is high enough to cause separation, the tube
is kept at that constant temperature for half an hour, being
repeatedly shaken. Taking the level of the mercury as con
stant, and calling it, when corrected for meniscus, 0, we have
first the height of the plane of separation of the two liquids to
read oft*. This requires no correction for meniscus at tempe
ratures below 25° C. At 30° and 50° there is some + cur
vature (like water); this I have neglected. The height of the
upper surface has to be read and corrected for meniscus.
(For this the same correction is taken as for water.) The
volume of water at 15° was 7-88 c. c, and the volume of tri
ethylamine was 9*5 c. c. On bringing the two together,
sufficient heat was set free by the mixture of part to prevent
the mixture of the whole. On cooling to 15° the two mixed
perfectly, and the volume was 16*6, showing therefore a
contraction of 0"8 c. c. At 180,3 the liquid still remained clear,
but at 18°"7, that is in half a degree, a great separation had oc
curred. In the following table the corrected readings are given.

    So nearly complete is the separation at 25°, that above this
temperature the upper stratum gives more in volume by
expansion by heat than it loses by the rise of the plane of
demarcation. To get an idea of the completeness of the sepa
ration at 50° C, we may compare the volume of the lower
stratum at 50°, which is 8*0, with that of 7-885 grams of water
at 50°, which is 7"93. This signifies that at 50° the lower
stratum must be nearly pure water, and the upper nearly
pure ethylamine. For the plane of separation stands only
A of the height of the original water-column above that
height. See fig. 1, curve b.

IN a number of previous communications f I have inves
       tigated the behaviour of gases under the influence of
electric discharges in various ways. The present research is
 a continuation of those investigations, and is concerned with
 (1) the effect upon the phenomena of interposing resistances
 between the poles of the machine and the electrodes of the
discharge-tube ; (2) the phenomena obtained with different
 distances between the electrodes; (3 ) measurements of the heat
 ing effect upon the gas at different points of the discharge ; (4)
 deflection of the positive discharge ; (5) the behaviour of the
 discharge under the influence of the magnet ; (l!) the exami
 nation of an hypothesis as to the nature of the kathode-rays,
 as well as (7) the nature of the positive discharge and the
 stratifications ; (8) further observations on the influence of
 the magnet ; (9) behaviour of bad conductors as kathodes ;
 (10) connexion of the potential of the discharge with the
 form of the electrodes ; and (11) remarks on the management
 of electrophone machines.
     The great complexity of the problem explains why the
 separate phenomena have not been hitherto sharply distin
 guished from each other, as, for example, the " glow "
 appearing at somewhat higher pressures, the kathode-rays
 which are formed at lower pressures, &c.

   There are also a series of interesting facts which have been
clearly observed, but of many of which it was not possible for
the same reason to determine the intimate connexion, by
which remark it is of course not intended in any way to
depreciate the work of the earlier investigators.
   The separate details have only gradually become of import
ance, and even now it is often difficult to recognize them
accurately in descriptions. I have endeavoured in the subjects
of which I treat to distinguish these relationships as accurately
as possible, and to make clear the conditions under which the
phenomena occur.
   In order to fix ideas we will agree upon the following
nomenclature :—The phenomena are best observed in tubes
having electrodes of a flat shape, because then the different
stratifications are formed at right angles to the axis of the tube.
   If k (fig. 3) is the kathode, scarcely any light is to be seen
in the part of the tube next it—this we will call the dark
negative space ; next to this comes a stratification (b), sharply
bounded on the side next the kathode, the bright negative layer.
From it issues light (b p) towards the anode, which becomes
continually fainter ; this we will call the glow-rays. They
are separated from the positive column of stratified light, of
which the first layer is p, by a dark space lip which may be
called the dividing space. The whole is traversed by the
kathode-rays Im issuing from the kathode k
   1. Influence of Interposed Resistances.—-The experiments
were so arranged that the one pole of the electrophone machine
was connected with the earth, whilst the other was in connex
ion with one electrode of the tube, the other electrode being
connected through the coils of a galvanometer with the earth.
Resistances could be introduced either between the discharge-
tube and the machine, or between the discharge-tube and the
earth. They consisted of long glass tubes on the outside
coated with shellac, and filled with distilled water in which
conducting wires plunged. The discharge was observed in a
mirror rotating with moderate velocity.
   The result generally obtained was that, whether resistances
were included or not, the deflection of the galvanometer was
the same during uniform action of the machine, and that
consequently the quantity of electricity passing through the
discharge-tube in unit time was always the same.
   The number of discharges, however, was found to be con-          1
siderably greater when resistances were employed than with
out, and the same result was obtained at very different pressures.
With discharge-tubes of the form usual to spectral-tubes the
discharge is always discontinuous. With wider discharge-tubes

                   Electric Discharge in Gases.               37
and flat electrodes, and .when the gas has the density for
which only a small potential is necessary for the discharge,
the image in the mirror often appeared continuous when
resistances were included, and, when they were removed,
resolved itself into a series of separate images.
   With discontinuous discharges, whether with or without
included resistances, in both cases the result obtained * by
Gr. Wiedemann and R. Riihlmann held good:—
   " If the positive electrode is connected with the machine,
and the negative put to earth, the number of discharges is
always smaller than with the reverse mode of connexion ; the
quantity of electricity necessary to bring about a discharge is
therefore greater in the former case than in the latter."
   It is a matter of indifference which of the two poles of the
machine is positive and which negative. A reversal of the
poles of the machine can always be produced by simply stop
ping the machine and starting it again.
   The influence of the introduction of resistances may be-
explained as follows :—
   To bring about a discharge from a metallic electrode, the
electricity must be accumulated upon it with a perfectly
definite density. If quantities of electricity are present upon
conductors connected with the electrode, these may, when once
the discharge has begun, and if they can reach the electrode
quickly enough, leave the electrode at a smaller potential than
is actually necessary for the commencement of the discharge.
Such accumulated electricity is, however, present in the larger
electrophone machines in a high degree, and in the smaller
machines in a smaller degree. To the conducting wires to the
poles and to the combs of the machine and the neighbouring
parts of the^glass plates there are, between any two discharges,
considerablequantities of electricity given off, which, as soon
as discharge from an electrode has been established, flow to it
and continue the discharge through the discharge-tube. If
the connexions are metallic, the flow is much more rapid ; the
time required to pass from the machine to the electrode is small
in comparison with the definite, although immeasurably small,
interval of time occupied by the discharge, and the whole
quantity of electricity passes through at once. But at the
same time the density upon the whole conducting system in
connexion with the electrode sinks at once to zero ; and a
longer time must elapse until it is again raised by the machine
so high that a new discharge can take place. If we include
larger resistances, the electricity will only flow slowly to the
electrode when once the discharge has taken place. The
               • Pogg. Ann. cxlv. pp. 235, 344 (ls72).

38                 •Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
density sinks therefore very rapidly at the electrode, and only
small quantities of electricity ' can follow the first quantity.
But the electricity accumulated upon the machine and flowing
to the electrode will very soon raise the density to the neces
sary point for the discharge to take place again, and without
large quantities of fresh electricity being produced. The
number of the discharges must therefore in the latter case
be much greater than in the first, with the same average
intensity of current, since in the latter case, in each discharge
only the quantity of electricity upon the electrode and close
to it is discharged, and in the former, on the contrary, the
quantity existing upon a much larger surface.
   The machine itself therefore acts as a sort of feeble con
denser.
   But since the law relating to the difference between positive
and negative electricity, discovered by my father, holds good
both when resistances are included and without, his result
cannot be explained by irregularities in the action of the
machine, by different behaviour of the combs, and so on,
since these would be compensated by the condensing action
of the machine. We may call the discharge, when resistances
are included, the normal discharge ; and the quantity of elec
tricity which passes over, under the same circumstances, also
the normal quantity, because it is just that quantity which,
under the precise conditions of the experiment, must be accu
mulated on the electrode in order to bring about a discharge.
   Since we observe, further, that always when, without resist
ances, the discharge is unstratified, it becomes stratified if
resistances are included, we may also conclude that "tJie
stratified discharge corresponds to the normal discharge ; " and
since the stratifications evidently require for their formation
a regular discharge, it further follows that in the normal
discharge the discharges occur in their simplest form.
   In exact agreement with the above we find that, when once
stratifications have been formed, whether with or without resist
ances, these disappear as soon as an air-spark is included, the
quantity of electricity transmitted in each discharge being thus
increased. Numerous experiments showed that, as a rule, the
stratifications form best when the negative electrode is con
nected with the machine, and the positive with the earth
through a large resistance. Tn the case of deviations of this
rule, which certainly occur frequently, it was always found that
the discharges, which were most numerous under the conditions
noted, gave place to less numerous discharges. The reason of
this could not, amongst numerous disturbing causes, always be
certainly determined : thus, for example, very peculiar pheno

mena occur when the machine is made to work very slowly,
and consequently the supply of electricity is much reduced.
If the pressure is so low that the dark negative space is about
2 centim.in breadth, whilst the glow-rays are separated from the
positive discharge by the dividing space, or even if there is no
positive discharge to be seen in the tube, and if then the
machine is worked more and more slowly, the positive light
expands round the positive electrode, whilst the negative light
also expands considerably, until the positive and negative
luminosities meet. This condition may be maintained for any
length of time.
   Since the experiments described above had shown that the
discharges obtained simply from an electrophoric machine
represent the simplest mode of discharge, it was necessary to
investigate whether the propositions first stated by Gr. Wiede
mann and R. Ruhlmann* and myself f as to the independence
of the heating of the gases upon the width of the tube, and the
quantity of electricity traversing it, would also hold good for
the case in which, by removing resistances, the quantity of
electricity passing in each discharge is increased. If it is
shown that changing the resistances produces no considerable
effect upon the quantity of heat produced either in a wide or
in a narrow tube, then it follows that if these two tubes are
included in the same circuit, equal quantities of heat must be
produced per unit of length, independent of the cross-section
of the tube.
   The experiments are arranged exactly like those described
in a previous communication J. In these experiments the
whole quantity of heat produced and that evolved within the
space connecting the electrodes (in the case of spectral tubes
within the capillary part) were determined. Experiments on
the heating of the electrodes themselves will follow later.

   From these numbers we see that the total heating does not
alter much, although a small increase is perceptible when the
same electricity is transmitted in a decreasing number of dis
charges. The removal of resistances corresponds to the
including of an air-spark, but the heating is certainly not
greater in proportion to the smaller number of discharges.
The same considerations which I have already stated* there
fore hold good.

   Here also the heating with and without resistances is nearly
the same, and again the heating increases somewhat as the
number of discharges decreases. This is pretty regularly the
case when we consider only the negative discharges ; with the
positive on the other hand, the minimum heating is at low
pressures without a resistance. The positive discharge ex
hibits therefore here, as in many other cases, a less regular
behaviour.

   The result is here generally the same as with the narrower
tubes. With a decreasing number of discharges the heating
for equal quantities of electricity increases relatively very
little. But if we take the numbers generally and observe that,
especially at low pressures, the including of resistances in
creases the number of discharges immeasurably, we see that
upon including resistances :—
   (1) The evolution of heat in a gas by a given quantity of
electricity which traverses it is almost independent of the
circumstance whether it traverses in one discharge or in many.
    (2) Hence, and from the previous result, it follows at once
that with two tubes of different diameters, included one behind
the other in the same circuit, equal quantities of heat per unit
of length are evolved, whether the number of discharges be
increased by inserting resistances or not.
    In fact the amount of heating in the narrow and in the wide
tubes is scarcely changed by the introduction of resistances ;
and since they are the same when no resistances are present,
they must also be equal in the other cases. Hence the same
laws hold for the normal discharge as for that usually examined.
    In connexion with this the following remarks must be made.
Certain advantages possessed by electrophoric machines over
induction-coils and large galvanic batteries for the investiga
tion of the discharge in vacuous tubes, have been noted by
various observers, and in particular by my father and by my
self. Our opinion is based upon the fact that, with the
electrophoric machines, only the quantity of electricity is dis
charged each time which is required to produce the potential
necessary, under the conditions existing in the tube and at
the electrodes, to initiate the discharge.
    That these views are not altogether correct is seen from the
above ; nevertheless for a number of investigations, and parti
cularly for those of spectroscopic nature, electrophoric machines
have advantages over other sources of electricity, not only
over induction-coils but also galvanic batteries, since with these
it is never possible to transmit large quantities of electricity
in disruptive discharge without condensers, by the use of
which the conditions are much complicated. With the elec

42                  Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
trophoric machine the simple introduction of an air-spark is
sufficient.
   2. Phenomena at different Distances of the. Electrodes.—It is
of importance to be able to trace the phenomena which result
when the distance of the kathode from the anode is changed
within somewhat wide limits. It is essential that the vessel
containing the electrodes should not be opened, for with each
such opening the pressure would be altered ; and the pressure
under which the first determinations were made is, especially
when low pressures are employed, not to be obtained again.
   In order to carry out experiments in the direction indicated,
I have constructed the following apparatus (Plate II. fig. 1) :—
   A is the discharge- tube, which communicates with the air-
pump at 6 ; a is an electrode firmly melted in, which is
connected with the machine in the manner already described *.
A second electrode, insulated in the usual way, is inserted at S ;
the lower part has melted on to it the outer portion (e) of a
ground glass joint. The inner portion (d) of the same forms
one end of a U-tube, B C, whose longer limb B is about 900
millim. long, and its shorter limb C about 500 millim.; at the
bend it is provided with a tap, and a platinum wire is melted
 in at E. The two portions of the joint are connected by caout
 chouc bands at s .</ and 1 1' in the manner already described f-
 So much mercury is next introduced into the U-tube that it
 stands in each limb about 400 millim. high.
    The second electrode is formed by the plate /9, which can
be replaced by a point &c. It is fastened and connected with
the machine as follows :—A thin platinum wire is melted into
one end of a thin glass tube of suitable length, and the end
 within the glass tube covered with a little mercury. Into this
dips the end of an aluminium wire which traverses the whole
 length of the tube, and on the top of which the plate is screwed.
 By this arrangement the whole conducting wire up to the
 electrode was covered with glass. In other cases the metallic
 wire was left uncovered.
    The rod carrying the electrode thus floated with its lower
 end in the mercury in the limb B. By pouring mercury into
 C, or allowing it to run out from h, the level could be raised
or lowered, and thus the electrode /9 made to approach or
 recede from the plate a. To regulate the motion it was neces
 sary to provide the rod with some guidance : the simplest plan
was apparently to make the tube B so narrow that the rod can
just move up and down it ; there was, however, so powerful a
 capillary action, that not only in this case, but also when much
        * Wied. Ann. x. p. 206 (1880) ; Phil. Mag. vol. x. p. 300.

                   Electric Discharge in Gases.                   43
wider tubes were chosen and the rod came into contact with
the sides of the tube, any regular motion was impossible. A
star-shaped piece of platinum foil was therefore fastened to
the lower part of the rod with a little wax ; and as a further
guide the upper end of d was covered with a plate having in
it a hole just large enough to allow the rod to pass through.
In order to introduce the electrode Q into the space A, either
the tube d was made larger than the plate, or else the tube
A was cut in two ; and after the plate had been introduced into
A and the rod carrying it passed through C, the tube was
melted together again; the terminal wires of the machine
plunged in a and e, or in a and 8, as the case might be*
   In order to follow the rhythm of the discharges in the dis
charge-tube, which it is difficult to do in the luminous phe
nomena of the tube itself, on account of its great width, and
especially when the discharges are irregular, or are confined
to special parts of the tube, it is advisable, besides the wide
tube, to include also a second tube in the circuit, which it is best
to take of the form shown in fig. 2. This is made out of a wide
tube by contracting the middle portion before the blowpipe ;
the tube is exhausted so far that it offers as small a resistance
as possible to the current traversing it : a and b are flat
electrodes which offer a smaller resistance to the currents than
points do ; they are placed as shown in the figure, in order
to afford a rapid indication of the direction of the current.
The middle portion of the tube is observed in the revolving
mirror; its relatively great luminosity and small section render
it easy to judge in the rotating mirror whether the discharges
follow each other quickly or slowly.
   In the following experiments it is always assumed that the
exhaustion has been carried very far, so that the kathode is
surrounded by a dark space :—
   If we allow a positive electrode a (/S of the figure) to
approach a negative plate k (a of the figure), the positive
electrode consisting of a wire which is cut off together with
the glass surrounding it, and which dips into the mercury,
the following phenomena are observed :—
   If a is at a considerable distance from k we have a head of
positive light about a, and stratifications between a and the
 glow-rays, of which even the first quite fills the section of the
tube and is much curved. If a rises, the layers do not
change their position, but one after the other disappear as
soon as they touch the positive electrode ; this is also the case
with the last layer nearest the kathode.
   As soon as the end of the wire has passed through this,
there is only a small bundle of positive light to be seen upon

                       Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
the end of the wire a; this also becomes smaller and smaller,
without however entirely vanishing ; the positive light radiates
upwards until the end of the positive electrode has broken
through the boundary of the dark negative space about the
kathode ; then it at once flows downwards like a small lumi
nous waterfall. If the anode rises still higher and approaches
the negative plate, the discharge ceases to issue from it and takes
place, in highly inconstant fashion, between the upper surface
of the mercury-column in the U-tube and k. I found thus,
as Herr Goldstein has found, that if a positive electrode
approaches a negative pole, the end of the positive column
remains
     • •11  unchanged. But whilst he asserts that when the
positive pole approaches the negative within a distance equal
to or less than the interval between the negative pole and the
experiments showed that there always remains on the positive
electrode a little cap of reddish-yellow positive light even when
the electrode has much over-passed the end of the positive
light ; it becomes smaller only gradually. It seems as if this
cap, adhering to the positive electrode, were firmly united to it.
    Whilst the mode of combination of the positive and nega
tive light can best be followed with electrodes of the form
described, certain other phenomena appear much more dis
tinctly if we employ a second plate for the movable positive
electrode.
    If we allow the anode to approach the kathode, all the
phenomena are regular so long as the anode does not penetrate
into the dark space about the kathode, i. e. layer after layer
disappears, and when the last has been traversed there remains
a small cap of positive ligbt upon the plate, which ascends
with it but becomes gradually smaller. If, however, the plate
penetrates into the dark space, we always observe a deforma
tion of the negative stratifications, the blue light is driven
behind the kathode, whereas it was before only in front, and
there forms on the wall a narrow strip of positive light, as also
Hittorf * observed upon close approach of anode and kathode.
The kathode-rays themselves, which usually proceed from the
centre of the kathode, are compressed altogether to the edge of
the kathode, from which they issue like a star, whilst the
middle of the kathode remains quite dark t ; moreover kathode
   * r*ogg. Ann. vol. exxxvi. pp. 1, 197 (1809).
   t This experiment shows that the kathode-rays do not always run in
the direction of the lines of force. In the case of two parallel plates the
lines of force HTe at right angles to the plates, and in the spnee between
them the potential falls most rapidly, nevertheless the kathode-rays issue
from the edge of the plate.

                   Electric Discharge in Gases.                45
and anode attract each other with great force. If they have
been made to touch, and then we try to separate them, sparks
leap across and the kathode vibrates to and fro.
    If the machine works very slowly, then, as soon as the blue
negative layer has been traversed, irregular discharges set in,
the green light of which is seen at different points of the tube,
just as with a tube which has been exhausted so far that the
discharges traverse the gas only with difficulty.
   A conclusion as to these last phenomena is furnished by
experiments in which the poles of the machine are brought
within a small distance, some 3 or 5 millim., of each other,
and then the lower electrode is allowed to approach the other ;
as soon as the two electrodes are sufficiently near, a stream of
sparks passes between the poles of the machine, whilst the
tube remains dark. If, then, the distance of the electrodes is
increased, the discharge in the tube suddenly commences,
whilst no electricity passes between the poles of the machine.
If, now, besides the experimental tube, we include also the
comparison-tube in the circuit, then, when sparks are passing
between the poles of the machine, we see the walls of the
tube shine with bright green phosphorescence at the points
where positive light appears in the ordinary passage of the
discharge. The reason of this is, that the small distance
between the plates of the principal discharge-tube causes this
to act as a condenser ; they become gradually charged until
suddenly the discharge between the poles of the machine
commences, and the whole quantity of (negative) electricity,
which is accumulated on the one electrode of the tube, dis
charges itself suddenly backwards through the small tube,
and thereby produces the green light.
    It follows from the experiments described that, in highly
exhausted spaces, the discharge between a positive and a nega
 tive electrode, if their distance apart is less than a certain
 limit, takes place with greater difficulty the nearer they are
to each other. This result was confirmed and completed by the
following experiment :—
    Two discharge-tubes (figs. 4 and 46) were connected at the
same time with the pump, which in this case was a Geissler's
pump, instead of the Topler's pump usually employed. The
tubes were each 2t5 millim. wide and 39 millim. long ; electrodes
of aluminium wire were melted into each, which were covered
with glass except about 1 millim. In the tube a the electrodes
were 1 millim., in the other tube b, 20 millim. apart ; the tubes
were included in parallel arc in the circuit of the machine. At
high pressures the discharge took place only in a; at low pres
sures of about 5 millim. and less, in both tubes at the same

                    Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
time, and at still higher exhaustion only in a. When this was
the case, if the mercury reservoir of the pump was raised,
and the gas present in it thus driven again into the discharge-
tubes, then the discharge took place again in b and not in a. This
behaviour at high pressures, and at medium pressures, follows
at once from the views ordinarily held : at high pressures the
induction exerted by the electrodes upon each other, and on
the layer of gas between them, is of importance ; at medium
pressures the resistance of the positive column of light disap
pears in comparison with that of the negative light ; in fact,
at medium pressures the two tubes differ only by having a
positive column of different length, which exerts no percep
tible influence upon the potential which is necessary to the
discharge, so that the discharge can take place in both tubes
at the same time. At the third pressure mentioned above, the
dark space surrounding the kathode has, in the tube in which
the electrodes are close together, spread out so far that it
completely surrounds the anode. This opposes so great a re
sistance to the passage of the electricity, that the discharge
traverses only the tube in which the electrodes are far apart,
in which the dark kathode-space does not yet reach the posi
tive electrode. Upon still further exhaustion the dark kathode-
space surrounds the anode also in the tube b ; and now the
discharge must of course take place more easily in the tube
in which the electrodes are near each other, since here there
is a smaller part of the dark space to be traversed.
   From the experiments described above we draw the follow
ing two important conclusions :—
   (1) The dark kathode-space opposes a very great resistance
to the positive discharge.
   (2) The union of tlie positive and negative electricities takes
place in the " glow-rays."
   Hittorf * had already concluded, from experiments with
electrodes near together, that resistances existed in the neigh
bourhood of the kathode; but since he did not vary the distance
of the electrodes from each other, he was not able to determine
the position of the resistance, so as to explain the phenomena.
   3. Heating of the Gas at different Distances from t/ie
Kathode.—A whole series of experiments was undertaken, in
order to investigate the decrease of heating-effect in passing
from the negative pole towards the positive.
   For this purpose a method was employed which has already
been used by G. Wiedemann and R. Iiiihlmann j for another
purpose. The junction of a thermo-electric element, consisting

                    Electric Discharge in Gases.                 47
of two wires of iron and German-silver soldered together,
was kept in contact with the outside of the tube by means of
a spring, and the deflections read off upon an astatic galvano
meter. These give a measure for the heating of the glass
tube ; and this is nearly proportional to the heating of the
portions of gas close at hand. The experiments were always
so arranged that the thermo-electric element was moved from
the electrode towards the positive light, and back again in the
opposite direction ; the deflections were only noted after they
had become constant.
   In the following tables we give the differences of the de
flections A observed at the position of the positive light, and at
different distances E from the kathode. The length of the dark
kathode-space was taken as measuring the pressure. In the
curves the abscissae represent the distances from the kathode,
and the ordinates the deflections of the galvanometer.

   As with this tube the numbers run exactly as with the
others, no curve is given.
   All these experiments show that for the low pressures at
which the dark kathode space is distinctly formed the follow
ing holds good :—
    The production of heat in the electric discharge, starting from
the positive electrode, rises at first slowly, then rapidly, reaching
its maximum within the "glow-rays," from which point it
decreases, attaining a relative minimum within the dark space
about the kathode, to which, however, corresponds a much higher
production of heat than in the positive light. At the kathode
itself the production of heat attains a very high value, as shown
by separate experiments.
   If the pressure is increased, then with decrease of length
of the dark kathode-space and shortening of the glow-rays
the maximum and minimum of heating-effect move closer
together, until at last they can no longer be separated by
experimental means.
   In order further to prove the peculiar course of the heating-
effects obtained by the methods described and shown by means
of the curves, the following arrangement was employed. At
the upper end of the usual float carrying the electrode (PI. II.
fig. 1) a thermometer was attached, having its scale below, as
shown in fig. 7. The mercury reservoir a is cylindrical,
5 millim. broad and 17 millim. long. It is protected against
the kathode-rays by a horizontal screen b of mica carried by
a pair of platinum wires c. But as these measurements are
concerned, not with the temperatures of the gas, but with the
quantities of heat produced in the unit time, the rise in
temperature in equal times must be observed when the ther
mometer is placed at different points of the tube. We must,
of course, also apply corrections for radiation and conduction :
this was done by observations before and after breaking the
current in the usual way. The measurements were carried
out with a tube of about 140 millim. width and 500 millim.
long. The dark space had a length of about 35 millim.
   The following table gives the numbers found in three series
(I., II., III.) of experiments. The different series are not
comparable with each other as to absolute value.
   E denotes the distance of the electrode ; W the observed rise
in temperature in arbitrary units (generally 1^x5° Per minute
for a current producing 100 millim. deflection).

   When the mica shield touched the electrode, a very great
rise was observed.
   The course of production of heat, as given by measurements
with the thermometer, is thus exactly the same as that fur
nished by measurements with the thermo-electric element.
From a minimum in the positive discharge it rises to a maxi
mum, then sinks to a minimum, finally attaining a second
maximum at the kathode itself.
   The causes of these peculiarities in heating-effect cannot be
determined without further experiment, but in the meantime
we may note the following points.
   The followiug equation holds good for any body traversed
by the current
                    a2v yv d2v
where V denotes the potential at any point and p the density
at the same point. If we have a tube (whose axis is the axis
of x) whicb the current fills uniformly, then
          yy yy                           yv
          K-j = gpr = 0; consequently          = —iirp.
In ordinary conductors p = 0 : hence ^— is constant, or, for
unit length, Vft— Vi = constant, being proportional to the
resistance w. Hence if a denote an absolute constant,
Hence, with equal resistances, there must be equal productions
of heat in equal lengths. If wo find that the heat-production
at different points of a tube is not constant, this is explained,
if p = 0, by the fact that the resistance at different points of
the tube is very different.
   We have seen that close to the electrode we have a very
                                E2

  52                 Prof. E.Wiedemann on the
  large production of heat, and that this decreases, reaching a
  minimum within the dark kathode-space, then it rises again
  to a maximum within the glow-rays, and sinks again towards
  the positive light.
     It is therefore, according to our previous experiments, not
  possible to deduce the change in heating-effect from the
  change in resistance. We have not the maximum heating
  exactly at those places where the greatest resistance is offered
  to the radiation of the positive Tight. There are now two
  things possible, either (1) p is not zero—that is, free electricity
  moves within the tube ; or (2) a part of the fall in potential is
 used up at those points where the heating-effect is a minimum
 in imparting to the electricity a certain kinetic energy, which
 disappears again at the points of maximum heating-effect.
     I shall endeavour to determine which of these two views is
 the correct one by special measurements of potential within
 the tube.
    4. Deflection of the Positive Column of Light.—Two circum
 stances are of importance in connexion with the deflection of
 the sensitive positive light, which takes place upon touching
 the tube traversed by the discharge with the finger ; it some
 times consists in an irregular attraction, sometimes in a
 symmetrical deflection.
    The one circumstance is the change in the distribution of
 free electricity upon the wall of the glass tube, by which the
 potential is lowered at the point touched, and the discharge is
 deflected towards Ihe point touched ; this is especially the
 case at high pressures. The second circumstance is the
 formation of a dark space at the point where positive elec
 tricity flows into a conductor, or becomes bound. The ex
periments with the floating electrode show, indeed, that the
passage of the positive electricity through the dark space
meets with groat resistance, and then the discharge bends
round backwards. But so soon as any point of the wall is
put into connexion with the ground, a kathode is produced at
that point, kathode-rays issue from it, and the peculiar
reddish light is seen ; consequently a dark space must form
around this point, which prevents a portion of the tube from
being traversed by the positive light, round which the dis
charge therefore bends.
    Exactly similar reasons explain the luminosity of the tube
when, the discharge being such that the tube remains dark, it
is encircled by the fingers, or by a ring of tin-foil. Then the
whole wall at the points touched becomes a kathode, and
opposes to the discharge a great resistance, which is, of
course, attended by a loss of energy, and has for consequence

                   Electric Discharge in Gases.               53
a brighter luminosity of the gas. To the same cause I should
be disposed to refer tho great heating, otherwise so remark
able, in a calorimeter surrounding the discharge-tube, when a
powerful discharge is sent through, and a good conducting
fluid in connexion with the earth is employed in the calori
meter. The quantities of electricity, which become bound,
become greater, especially where air-sparks are included, and
consequently the formation of the dark space is much facili
tated, so that the resistance offered to the passage of the
discharge must increase in a high degree.
   5. Influence of a powerful Magnet upon the Discharge.—The
results which we have obtained also explain the phenomena
which take place when the discharge is subjected to the action
of a powerful magnet. The best form of magnet to employ
is a cylindrical magnet, magnetized by a spiral of wire. It
is known that under the influence of such a magnet the
positive light is thrown into curves, which correspond nearly
to those assumed by a solid flexible conductor fixed at both
ends, whilst the glow-rays behave like a conductor fixed at
one end. In a wide, strongly exhausted tube the stratified
discharge was obtained, and then one pole of the electro
magnet described was moved along gradually from the
positive pole-plate a. The well-known forms appeared in
the positive light ; the discharge appeared continuous in the
revolving mirror. If we bring the magnet nearer to the
negative pole, the glow-rays become compressed at the side,
as may be seen from the green light which appears along the
wall, and the positive light with its stratifications is seen to
move, somewhat deformed it is true, in the space vacated by
 the glow-rays. The form of the discharge is represented in
fig. 6\ The bend at b corresponds to the magnet beneath:
    If the magnet is brought still nearer to the kathode, and so
 far that the tongue a reaches to the limit of the dark kathode-
space, it suddenly falls down and unites with glow-rays at tho
point where they strike tho wall, and the discharges become
discontinuous ; so that in this case a much higher potential is
necessary for the discharge than in tho first case, or a con
siderable resistance is produced.
    These experiments appear to me to show that tho formation
 and position of the positive light does not depend so much on
 the position of tho positive and negative poljs, but rather
 upon the formation of the glow-rays issuing from the negative
 pole, and that generally, in accordance with their formation
 and position, the discharge shows a greater or less degree of
 discontinuity.
    The above observation of the transformation of the con

54          Mr. F. Trouton on Molecular Latent Heat.
tinuous form of discharge into the discontinuous agrees
entirely with the results previously obtained by approaching
the positive to the negative pole. If we denote as the positive
direction of the glow-rays that which issues from the bright
kathode-layer, many discharges occurred so long as a union
of the positive electricity could take place in the negative
direction with the glow-rays ; but as soon as that was no
longer the case, much fewer discharges occurred. Exactly
the same is the case here, so long as the glow-rays have not
all been deflected from the axis of the tube to the side ; the
positive light can still unite with them in the negative direc
tion. But as soon as a complete deflection has taken place,
we have exactly the same case as if the positive electrode
were behind the bright kathode-layer, and the discharge
becomes continuous.

                IV. On Molecular Latent Heat.
       By Frederick Trouton, Trinity College, Dublin*.
ON comparing the quantities of heat necessary to evaporate
       at constant pressure quantities of different liquids taken
in the ratio of their molecular weights, it is found that the
amount of heat required by any body is approximately pro
portional to its absolute temperatnre at the point of ebullition.
For example, the latent heat of bromine is 45-9, it boils at
63°, and the density of the body is 79-75. The latent heat of
butyric acid is 1 14*7, it boils at 162°, and its density is 44.
The quantities of heat required to evaporate quantities of the
bodies in the ratio of their molecular weights is obtained by
multiplying the latent heat by the density ; and the quan
tities thus obtained have an approximately constant ratio to
the absolute temperatures of the boiling-points, thus :—
         45 9 y 79-75              114-6x44
          273 + 63° =1Q89> 273 + 162°= 11 59'
This ratio is nearly constant for most bodies, but is still more
nearly so for those bodies which are chemically related to each
other.
   The relation, then, may be put into this simple form.
The molecules of chemically related bodies, in changing from
the gaseous to the liquid state at the same pressure, disen
gage quantities of heat, which may be called the molecular-
latent heat, directly proportional to the absolute temperature
of the point of ebullition. The similarity is very striking

that the specific heat multiplied by the atomic weight is a
constant quantity.

the densities, in III. the boiling-points of the bodies ; and in
column IV. are the products of the latent heat by the density
divided by the absolute temperature of the boiling-point.
   In the case of the following acids the theoretic densities of
the first two are too small, owing to the vapour-densities being
abnormally great at temperatures approaching the boiling-
point. This is corrected for in formic acid in the ratio of 2*68
to 1*62, and acetic acid in the ratio of 3'19 to 2-0S. Without
the correction the numbers in the fourth column would be for
formic acid 7*44, for acetic acid 7-86.

   Iodine so far seems to deviate most from the above relation;
but perhaps, owing to the nature of the body in question, the
determination of the latent heat by Favre and Silbermann*,
as given in this table, need not be considered final. It would
appear that experiments have only once been undertaken
with a view to determine the latent heat of iodine. In fact
even the boiling-point 200° is only approximate.
V. On a "Speed Indicator" for Ships' Propellors. By Sir
  Archibald Campbell of Blythswood and W. T. Goolden")".
                               [Plate IV.J
IN February of last year, when visiting one of H.M.
      Dockyards, it was pointed out to us that a very urgent
need was felt of some means of indicating with certainty the
speed of naval engines, especially in ships carrying twin-
screws, where the engines are not only distinct, but separated
from each other by iron bulk-heads which prevent any com
munication between the two engine-rooms. The authorities
intimated also that it was desired that several indications
should be made simultaneously in various parts of the ship,
and that the apparatus should be as far as possible automatic,
and require no trouble or attention.
   Thero are at present one or two instruments in existence
for this purpose, but their indications are found to be untrust
worthy when at sea ; and we were warned that no instrument
in which the force of gravitation played a part would be
likely to receive any attention at the Admiralty. This
consideration excludes the use of ball-governors or of any
device depending on the weight of a fluid column ; and led
us to consider whether the desired conditions could not be
fulfilled by a purely mechanical arrangement founded on the
ordinary equation involving angular velocity,
                                v = ra.
   It was at first difficult to see how this principle could be
applied to a direct measure of o>, as no simple means are
known whereby the variation in the velocity v of a point
moving in a straight or curved path can be continuously
measured. But it. was soon apparent that the variable angular
velocity to of a body A can be compared with the constant

angular velocity a> of another body B, if a point on B at a
distance r' from its axis of rotation has the same linear
velocity as a point on the circumference of A. We then get
in which — is constant, and thus at varies as /.
           r
   The condition is evidently satisfied by a disk pressing on
the surface of a cone revolving at a uniform speed ; for the
linear velocity of the point in the perimeter of the disk which
is in contact with the cone, being identical with that of the
corresponding point of the cone, will be proportional to the
radius of tha corresponding circular section of the cone, and
consequently to the distance of the point of contact from the
apex of the cone. If, further, the disk forms the nut of a screw
rotating in the opposite diroction to the cone, and the axis of
the screw is placed parallel to the side of the cone, it is obvious
that the nut and screw must have the same angular velocity for
the nut to be at rest on the screw ; and the disk will therefore
take up a different position on the screw as the velocity of
the latter changes in value.
   In the " Blythswood Speed Indicator " the screw is driven
by the engine or shaft whose speed is to be indicated, while
the cone has a constant speed communicated to it by clock
work. A scale placed under the screw shows the speed of
the nut and screw when the nut is at rest ; and by a series
of electric contact-pieces attached to a cable, the indications
can be transferred to dials placed at any distance from the
machine.
   When the engines reverse, a clutch keeps the screw revolving
always in the same direction, and at the same time pulls over
a commutator placed in the electric circuit, so that tho dials
show not only the speed, but also the direction of motion,
ahead or astern.
   The clock is wound by the engine, and stops when the
machinery is at rest ; and having a carefully balanced friction-
governor, it is independent of gravity, and therefore keeps its
time under all conditions of wind and weather.
   Wo propose to add to the instrument a drum carrying
prepared paper, upon which as it revolves a pencil will
continuously trace the position of the nut, and thus keep a
record of the performance of the engine for future reference.
   The same principle can evidently be applied to a comparison
of the speeds of two engines or rotating shafts, where both

for —. = — , in which r is constant.

   We desire in conclusion to express the obligation we are

intelligence with which he has successfully carried out our
idea.
  VI. The Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagram. By Professors
       W. E. Ayeton, F.R.S., and John Perry, M.E.*
                               [Plate III.]
THE members of this Society are probably aware that gas-
       engines are now largely in use, and that their use is still
extending rapidly. Thero can be no doubt that gas-engines
would be largely used, even if they were wasteful of fuel, on
account of their being always ready to start or stop, and their
requiring so little attention ; but it is gradually becoming
clearer that even small specimens of this kind of engine, whose
history is merely beginning, are in actual fact less wasteful of
fuel than the largest and most carefully constructed steam-
engines. It is, for example, a demonstrated fact that, with a
Dowson's generator not larger than the boiler used in the
corresponding steam-engine, an Otto engine uses only 1*1 lb.
of coal per indicated horse-power per hour. It is therefore
not unreasonable to suppose that gas-engines will soon be
employed even in the propulsion of ships.
   The rapid growth of this new application of science renders
it necessary that help should be given to practical men to
enable them to use such observations as they are constantly
making. This paper is intended to teach such men a method
of obtaining information from the indicator-diagram of a gas-
engine.
   2. The Action in the Otto Gas-Engine.—This large model
which we exhibit has been constructed in the workshop of the
Finsbury College, to enable students to follow the motions of
different parts of the gas-engine. It will be seen that when
the piston is at the end of its stroke, only what we call the
clearance-space behind it is filled with fluid. This fluid is a
mixture of carbonic acid, water-vapour, and nitrogen, whose
temperature is about 410° C.f, if there was an immediately
  • Communicated by the Physical Society. Read April 26, 1884.
  t In our own observations at Finsbury we have not used any specially
contrived apparatus, as our investigations were really for the purpose of

 no             Professors Ayrton and Perry on the
 previous explosion. The temperature of the clearance-space
 fluid may be anything between 410° C. and the temperature
 of the atmosphere, depending on how recently an explosion
 has taken place. As the piston moves forward it draws into
 the space a mixture of gas and air. At the end of the for
 ward stroke the pressure of the mixed fluid is nearly that of
 the atmosphere ; in the back stroke the fluid is compressed.
 At the beginning of the next forward stroke the fluid is
 ignited, and rapid development of heat results, causing great
 increase in pressure, the pressure gradually diminishing until,
just before the end of the forward stroke, the fluid is allowed
 to escape. In the next back stroke the piston drives the fluid
 out of the C3"linder with the exception of what remains in the
 clearance, and thus completes a cycle of operations. In fig. 1
 (PI. III.) indicator-diagrams show the nature of the alterations
 in pressure and volume going on during the compression
 and working parts of the cycle; distances measured from 0 L
 representing pressure in pounds per square inch from vacuum,
and distances measured from 0 P representing volume of
the fluid, the unit of volume being the volume described by
 the piston moving through one foot of the length of the
 cylinder.
    Four different diagrams are given whose compression parts
practically coincide, the differences in their ignition parts being
due to differences in the amounts of gas supplied. We have
not thought it necessary to give a complete diagram in which
the dismission and suction parts of the cycle should be repre
sented.
    The shape of the diagram is materially modified by the
recentness of the last explosion, as this affects the temperature
of the fluid before compression, and so modifies the actual
amount of the mixture of gas and air entering the cylinder.
To a less degree the shape of the diagram is affected in the
discharge part of the cycle by the recentness of an explosion,
as a recent explosion will have given the exhaust passages a
higher temperature.
   3. The Nature of the Working Fluid.—For the purpose of
showing the nature of the working fluid we have constructed
Table 1. It will be seen from this that a mixture of 6-7u'0
enabling students to illustrate tor themselves a course of lectures delivered
by one of us on the Gas-engine. Hence we have taken the temperature
of 410° C. as the exhaust temperature, instead of 300° C. given by our
own measurements with the Siemens pyrometer. A correction of this
temperature would perhaps lessen the number 1-57 W and increase 0"37 W,
given in § 9.

                Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagram.                 61
cubic feet of air and coal-gas becomes, after complete combus
tion, G-4977 cubic feet of carbonic acid, water-vapour, and
nitrogen, reduced to the same pressure and temperature with
out condensation of the water-vapour. Now as there is always
an excess of air, and as the mixture before combustion has
added to it nearly six cubic feet of the products of previous
combustions, We have something like 13"3 cubic feet before
combustion becoming 13'0377 cubic feet after combustion, at
equivalent pressures and temperatures. The contraction is
only about 2 per cent. We therefore conclude that we may
regard the fluid in a gas-engine as a fluid which, however it
may receive heat, obeys approximately the characteristic law,
                           %p constant
(where p is pressure, v volume, and T the absolute tempera
ture), in so far as mechanical actions are concerned. That is,
wo may speak of it as a perfect gas, which receives heat from
without, neglecting the fact that it is its own molecular energy
•which appears as heat. It is also approximately true that the
ratio of the specific heats of the fluid is unchanged by com
bustion taking place.
   In Table II. we give a similar comparison for Dowson
gas :—
      2*1325 cubic feet of combustible mixture become 1*9143
           cubic feet ;
or, taking into account the clearance-space and its products of
past conibustions, we have, say,
     4 cubic feet becoming 3'7818 cubic feet ;
or contracting by nearly 5£ per cent, of its volume.
   In Tables III. and IV. we calculate the specific heat of a
mixture of 1 cubic foot of coal-gas, 5'76 cubic feet of air, and
4*5 cubic feet of products of a previous combustion, before
and after combustion takes place. The Centigrade scale of
temperature is employed.
   In Tables V. and VI. similar calculations are made for the
usual mixture of Dowson gas with air and products of previous
combustion.

    The specific heats here given are those of the constituents
 in the cold state. Seeing, however, that there is no great
 change due to combustion, we may for many practical pur
 poses assume that the specific heats remain the same at all
 temperatures. We have less right when using Dowson gas
 than when using coal-gas to make our assumption, which is
 that the fluid in the gas-engine, from the beginning of ita
 compression until it is allowed to escape, behaves like a perfect
 gas, receiving heat from an outside source.
    4. Study of the Shapes of the Compression and Expansion
 parts of the Diagram.—The first problem which comes before
 us is the determination of the shape of the indicator diagram.
 For the sake of illustration -we mean to investigate the series
 of diagrams shown in fig. 1, diagrams taken from a G-horse
 power Otto engine at the Finsbury College, using coal-gas.
 It will be observed that, although the ignition parts of the
various diagrams differ greatly, on account of differences in the
 amounts of pas supplied, the curves agree in their compression
and expansion parts. It is known to us that the clearance-
space is 0'4 of the whole space occupied by fluid when the
piston is fully at the end of its stroke. If X is the distance in
feet passed through by the piston from the end of its stroke,
the stroke being 1^ foot, the clearance is 0889 foot, and
\ + 0-889, or I feet expresses the volume of the fluid at
any instant. Measurements of / and p were made on the
expansion-curves of the indicator-diagrams, and tabulated
with log I and \ogp.
   "W e are making arrangements for measuring the clearance-
space with accuracy. The above assumption is made from
statements of the manufacturers, and may possibly be slightly
in error. Such an error is of but small importance to us at
present, as our object is to teach a method of study rather
than to give results of the use of the method.

                  Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagram.                (35
     If we assume the law of the expansion-curve to be
                            plm constant,
 we have logp + m\ogl=k ; so that when we plot log^> and
 log I on squared paper as coordinates of points, these points
 ought to lie in a straight line if our assumption is correct.
 Fig. 2 (PI. III.) showshow the points determined by the mea
 sured numbers lie ; and it is obvious that they lie very nearly
 in a straight line. Taking the straight line which lies most
 evenly among them, we find that it is defined by
                 logZ=0"313,      when log/?=l-7,
                  log/=0-0425, when logp=2\L.
 Hence
                       1-7 + 0-313 m = k,
                      2-1 + 0-0425 m=L
 Hence
                    m= 1-479 and k = 2' 1629.
 Now
                        log 145-5 = 2-1629.
 Hence the law of expansion is
                       pV*n= 145-5                           (1)
 In the same way we find that the law of the compression-
curve is
                       ^'•^=39-36                            (2)
 It is obvious that the expansion-curve (1) is steeper than the
 adiabatic, if we assume that the ratio of specific heats of the
 fluid is 1-37, as the equation of the adiabatic curve is
                       pl1,3?= constant.
Again, the compression-curve (2) has less slope than the
adiabatic. ¦
    5. Influence of Vibrations of the Indicator-spring.—We wish
to point out that it is exceedingly necessary, in obtaining the
law of expansion, to take many points in the curve, and, either
by using the algebraic method or by the use of squared paper,
to determine the most probable values of the constants.
Engineers are constantly in the habit of determining these
constants from measurements of the coordinates of two points
only in the curve, forgetting that the position of either point
may be much influenced by the vibrations of the spring of
the indicator. The sinuous shape of the expansion-curve is
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 18. No. 110. July 1884.          F

 66             Professors Ayrton and Perry on the
 specially noticeable in the early part of the expansion-curves
 of gas-engine diagrams.
    It is further to do remarked that the vibration of the indi
 cator-spring is very visible in the expansion part, because we
 have every reason to believe that the expansion part ought to
 have no sinuosities ; but it is our belief that this vibration has
 its effect on the explosion part of the curve as well, and that
 it is of the utmost importance to find some means of elimina
 ting the effects produced by these vibrations of the indicator-
 spring.
    In our communication to the Journal of the Society of
 Telegraph Engineers, p. 391, vol. v. (1876), we showed how
 to eliminate such vibrations in any case where the effect to be
 measured followed a regular law of increase or diminution, as
 in the case of the expansion part of this indicator-diagram.
 We have not yet sufficient information to enable us to employ
 this method on the explosion part.
    The rule which we arrived at is as follows :—Draw two
 curves, A and B, through the highest and lowest points of the
 wavy curve which represents the actual observations : draw
 ordinates : the points of bisection of the parts of the ordinates
 intercepted between A and B lie on the correct curve.
    6. Empirical Formula for the whole Diagram.—Now, inas
 much as the compression and expansion parts of all the curves
 follow the same laws, it would seem to be important to obtain
 one general formula for all the diagrams with one or more
 variable parameters. We have found that when we produce
 the expansion-curve (using formula 1), as shown at BM(fig. 1),
 and wnen we divide the pressure Q R at any part of the stroke
 by the corresponding ordinate LE of the expansion-curve,
 doing this for many parts of the stroke, we get the ordinate of
 an interesting curve. We have done this for the four dia
 grams of fig. 1, and obtain the four curves A Q B D, AECD,
 A F D, A G H of fig. 3. From a study of these curves, which
are nearly formed of straight fines, it will be found that the
ignition and expansion parts of any diagram satisfy approxi
mately the law
          p = 145-5 r 1479 {k> + n\- v/(*-n\)s + «} . . . (3)
The smaller the value of s the more nearly do the curves of
fig. 3 approach straight lines. In our present case X= I— 0-889,
«/ = 0-6343, k = 0-3637; « =0-0087, and n has different values
for the four diagrams. These constants are evidently easily
calculated from any diagrams. For the curve shown as
A B C D in fig. 1 (PI. III.) the value of n is 2-2876. Using this
value and calculating p for the following values of I, we have

   The differences between the observed and calculated values
of p are within the limits of errors of observation therefore.
It may be that there is a discontinuity in the ignition-curve
at \=-061 for a mixture of gas and air; but no discontinuity
shows itself in the indicator-diagram in a sufficiently marked
manner to be distinguished from vibrations due to the spring
of the indicator.
   As we have already stated, the recentness of the last explo
sion affects the temperature of the mixture of gas and air,
and therefore the mass of the mixture. Hence we often find
tbat the expansion parts of successive indicator-diagrams do
not coincide. The law
             p=m-vm{K/ + n\-s/(K-n\y + s] ,
where id, k, and n are constants, satisfies all the diagrams,
   n is a constant whose value depends on the point in the
      stroke at which the maximum pressure occurs ; and this,
      for a given speed of engine, depends principally on the
     proportion of gas to air in the mixture ;
   M is a constant which depends on the recentness of the last
     explosion.
   7. Simple Formula; far the Ignition and Expansion parts of
the Diagram.—The complete formula (3) assumes no want of
continuity in proceeding from the ignition to the expansion
part of the diagram. For the sake of ease in practical calcu
lations we may, however, assume that the ignition- and expan
sion-curves are quite discontinuous, employing some method
of indicating continuity when results are plotted on squared
paper. In this case we assume that the lines of fig. 3 are

    8. The Rate at which the Fluid receives Heat as calculated
from its Volume and Pressure.—We shall now proceed to cal
 culate the heat received by the fluid. This we shall do as if,
 instead of there being combustion going on among the par
 ticles of the fluid, we had the fluid a perfect gas receiving
 heat from a great number of little furnaces, or pieces of hot
 wire immersed in the fluid. Besides the heat here considered
 we have the heat radiated to the cold cylinder.
    If A is the area of the piston in square inches, p the pressure
 of the fluid in pounds per square inch, and I the distance
moved through by piston in feet, the work done by the fluid
on the piston in an element of length dl is
                        Ap dl foot-pounds.
 It is evident that if we represent the heat which is received
 by the fluid in the length dl by
                        Aq dl foot-pounds,

                 Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagram.                69
we may regard q as the rate (per foot-travel of the piston) at
which heat is received by the fluid, just in the same sense as p
the pressure is the rate at which work is done by the fluid ;
and a comparison of q and p shows at once the comparison
between the rates at which heat is being received and work is
being done.
   Now, since we consider the fluid to behave like a perfect
gas, we know from thermodynamics that
where 7=1-37 (see §§3 and 4) ; and it is obvious that the
relation of p to q is not altered in any way by altering the
scale to which I or p is represented in the indicator-diagram.
    We have taken three methods of drawing the curve whose
ordinate is q. In the first method a list of the values of
p was made out from careful measurements of the curve
A BOD (fig. 1), for values of I, 0-889, 0-9, 0-911, 0-922,
0-933, 0-944, &c. The observed increment of p divided by
the increment of I was taken to represent the value of J* for
the mean value of I. In this laborious way q was obtained
 for many values of I, and the curve EFGH (fig. 4) repre
 sents our result. It is obvious that the rate at which the
 fluid receives heat is greatest at the very beginning of the
 stroke, falling off during the ignition period, much more
 rapidly at the end of the ignition period ; and in OH we see
 that the fluid is losing heat during what we call the ex
 pansion part of the stroke. In the same figure the actual
 indicator-diagram is shown in A B C D, the pressure being
 shown to the same scale as the ordinate of the neat-diagram.
    The area between EFGH, the line 0\, and any two ordi-
 nates, shows in foot-pounds the heat given to the fluid between
 the two positions, to the same scale as that to which the area
 of the indicator-diagram represents work done.
    Another method which we have taken is this. To find q
 corresponding to a point S (fig. 5) on the indicator-curve.
 Draw a tangent S R to the indicator-curve, meeting the line
 O P in B. O P and O L are the lines O P and O L of fig. 1.
 Draw from B a line B Q parallel to O L, meeting the ordinate
 from S in the point Q. Then the distance S Q, or rather
 TS-TQ, represents
                               dp
 Measuring S Q, therefore, paying attention to the lact that it

70              Professors Ayrton and Perry on the
may be negative or positive, adding to it 7 times S T and
dividing by 7— 1, we obtain the ordinate q of the heat-curve.
   Another method is to calculate q as given in (6), by actual
differentiation of p as given in (3). We have employed this
method, and believe that our result, in which the early part
of the curve E F (fig. 4) is less steep than there shown, is
probably more nearly true than what is given in fig. 4. We
do not put our result forward at present because there may be
a discontinuity in the explosion part of the curve, as Table VII.
shows that at \=-061 the empirical formula does not give the
observed pressure; and until we know how to eliminate vibra
tional effects of the indicator-spring, we have preferred only
to publish the curve E F G H which has been obtained from
the actual diagram, the expansion part only having been cor
rected for vibrations. As we know that the expansion part
follows a law
                            p = Kl~m,
it is obvious that
                                 y—m
being proportional to the pressure. Now, comparing this
result with the part G H (fig. 4), we see that G H is not quite
correct, although determined from most careful measurements
of the indicator-diagram. We see here an illustration of the
great importance of obtaining a formula such as that given in
(3) for the shape of the indicator-diagram.
   9. Total Heat and Work of One Cycle.—The integral of q . dl
multiplied by the area A of the piston in square inches gives
the total heat received by the fluid during any part of the
stroke, and is evidently
          A§''9 • dl= ~i (M-M)+ a£ p • di.
Taking from the diagram
                       />i=44-5,   h= -889,
                       Pi = 49-0,  l3= 2-089,
so that /2 — ?1 = 1,2 foot (^corresponds to the part of the stroke
at which the exhaust-valve opens), it is evident that
                    fhq.dl= 169-5 + (%.<fl                     (7)
                   Ji,                Jit
Or if q„ is the mean value of q during this portion of the

                 Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagram.                 71
stroke, and if pm is the mean value of p, then
                     1-2 qm= 169-5 + V2Pwt,
or
                         qm= 141-25 +pm.
We find from the diagram that pm=94-5, so that g,m = 235,75.
   Now 1*2 Aqm is H, the total heat given to the fluid to alter
        its volume and pressure until the exhaust-valve opens ;
   1-333 Ax 61-52 is the indicated work W of the cycle, as
         calculated from the total indicator-diagram, including
        the dismission and suction parts not shown in fig. 1.
Hence            H= 1-333 x?i'7552W' °r 3"45 W>
   As we know that combustion, about the period of opening
of the exhaust-valve, is just sufficient to supply the loss by
radiation to the cylinder without having much effect on the
volume and pressure of the fluid, we can assume that any
combustion after that time produces hoat which is radiated to
the cylinder. We are told that there is no combustion in the
exhaust. For the small amount of combustion after the
exhaust-valve opens we do not see our way at present to the
basis of any but the very roughest assumption, and we think
that attention ought to be paid to this matter in future inves
tigations. What complicates the question is the fact that the
mass of the fluid which radiates heat to the cylinder rapidly
gets less after the exhaust-valve opens. To obtain a first
approximation, we may assume that the heat of combustion
after the exhaust-valve opens is equal to the work done in the
forward stroke after that time—that is, 014 W.
   The heat retained by the fluid is 141-25 x A x 1-2, or 1-94 W.
    The gases in the exhaust-pipe close to the cylinder are
 known to have a temperature not much greater than 400° C.
 Hitherto it has been customary to calculate the amount of
heat carried off by the gases through the exhaust-pipe from
the heat-capacity multiplied by the difference of temperature
from that of the atmosphere. It must be remembered, how- »
ever, that the total heat of combustion of coal-gas contains the
 latent heat of the steam produced, and that the exhaust gases
 carry off this heat. Hence the amount of about 0-95 W, de-
 ducible from the experiments of Messrs. Brooks and Steward,
 must be increased by two thirds of itself, giving T57 W as the
 energy carried off by the gases in the exhaust-pipe.
    Hence (1-94—1-57) W, or 0-37 W, is the amount of energy
 which is lost by the fluid from the opening of the exhaust-
 valve until the fluid is passing along the exhaust-pipe outside

72              Professors Ayrton and Perry on tl\e
the cylinder. This is largely expended in heating the cylinder
itself, in friction at bends in the exhaust-valve, &c. ; so that it
disappears as radiated heat, and as heat given to the water-
jacket during the remaining parts of the cycle. Now we may
safely take it that the expenditure of gas is about 22 cubic
feet per hour per indicated horse-power; so that, using the
heat of combustion calculated in Table I., the total energj' of
combustion of the gas used is 5*91 W ; and we are now in a
position to make the following table. Of the 5*91 W, the
total energy of combustion of a charge, we have:—
    1*38 W. Work of forward working-stroke till exhaust-
                 valve opens.

                 valve, partly during the succeeding three fourths
                 or non-working parts of the cycle.
     It is found by experiment that the water from the water-
jacket carries off somewhat more than 50 per cent, of the total
 heat of combustion, or 2*96 W; but it is almost impossible to
 make this measurement accurately for one cycle. It is some
 times as much as 62 per cent, and sometimes as little as 35
 per cent. We have not employed such a measurement here,
 partly for this reason, and partly on account of the rate of loss
 during three fourths of the cycle being indeterminate. Again,
 the cylinder loses heat by radiation as well as by the water-
 jacket; so that, even if we could assume that such a number as
    * It may be well to state here that we do not know with certainty the
 amount of gas used per indicated horse-power when the particular diagram
 which we are discussing was being taken, nor are we quite sure that
 Mr. Clerk is right in saying that the exhaust-gases show complete
 combustion when the engine is working to its full power. Our
 arrangements for determining this latter point are now nearly complete.
 We consider that there was no possibility of the expenditure having been
 less than 20 cubic feet per hour per indicated horse-power when our dia
 gram was taken ; and if we take 24 as a higher limit, and assume with
 Mr. Clerk that combustion is complete in the exhaust-pipe, we find the
 amount of heat given to the cylinder during the forward-working stroke
 by radiation before the exhaust-valve opens could not have been less than
 1-77 W, the higher limit giving 2-86 W,

50 per cent, is correct, we are still not in a position to state
the total loss of heat from the cylinder.
   It is to be remembered that W is the indicated work. The
useful work of a gas-engine, given out by the crank-shaft, is
about 08 W, there being an expenditure of 02 W in over
coming the mechanical friction of the engine.

obtained by us by employing (6) on the discontinuous expres
sions of § 7 for the indicator-diagrams.
   11. Rate of Loss of Heat by the Fluid during Compression.—
For the compression part of the diagrams,
                           7=1-385,
and
                           ^=39-36 rSM.
Bate at which heat is received by fluid is — q, if
and by § 8,

                          7-l=-385.
 Therefore the rate at which heat is received by fluid is
                            -0-2104p,
 being proportional to the pressure, and is negative—that is,
 the fluid is radiating heat to the cylinder.
    12. Rate at which Fluid radiates Heat to cold Cylinder.—
 It was found by the pyrometric measurements of Messrs.
 Brooks and Steward that the temperature of the products of
 combustion in the clearance-space, if there has been a recent
 explosion, is about 410° C. ; and for the purpose of deter
 mining the temperature of the fluid before compression, they
 take 1-4 volume of coal-gas and 9-25 of air at 22° C. with
 7'94 volumes of products of past combustions at 410° C, from
 which, assuming that the specific heats of the constituents do
 not alter with temperature, they find that the temperature of
 the mixture before compression is 120° C. This is sufficiently
 correct for our present purpose, and if we take it as the tempe
 rature when i=2'222, p0=14'7, we can find the temperature
 corresponding with any point of any of the indicator-diagrams.

   From some diagrams examined by us we find that the fluid
may have as high a temperature as 1900° C.
   The temperature of the water leaving the water-jacket was
about 60° 0. ; and we may for our purposes assume that the
rate at which the fluid loses heat to the cylinder is proportional
to the excess of its temperature above 60° C, so that t — 60°
represents, to some scale, the fluid's loss of heat to the
cylinder per second. This rate of loss is shown on the curve
AB(fig.6>
   Now if H is the quantity of heat which has been given by
the fluid to the cylinder-jacket at the time t, then                  is
represented by the ordinate of the curve A B.            But

that is,      is proportional to the ordinate of a semicircle CE F.
Describing the semicircle C E F with a diameter equal to the
length of the stroke, and dividing the ordinates of A B by
those of 0 E F, we obtain the curve G H I, whose ordinate at
any point represents the rate of the fluid's loss of heat to the
cylinder per foot of piston-motion ; so that the whole area

                Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagram.                 75
C G H I F represents the total loss of heat to the cold cylinder
during the stroke. We are in a position to speak of the loss
of heat from \=0 to X=T2 (see § 9).
   This loss must be represented on the diagram to the same
scale as the indicator-diagram represents work done, and it is
expended in the part of the working stroke from \=0 to
\= 1*2. Hence if k is the mean ordinate of such a diagram,
             £=2-31 x 61-52 x 1*330*1-2=158.
   Now the mean ordinate of the curve GHI (fig. 6) from
X=0 to X=l*2 beina taken and found different from 158, all
the ordinates of G H I (fig. 6) have been diminished in the
proportion of 158 to the mean ordinate of G H I (fig. 6) to
get the diagram X L Y of fig. 4. This diagram XLY repre
sents the rate of loss of heat by conduction and convection
from the fluid to the cylinder during the working stroke until
the exhaust-valve opens.
   13. Rate at which Combustion goes on during the Stroke.—
The curve E F G H represents the rate at which heat is actu
ally gained by the fluid, and XLY shows the rate at which
heat is wasted to the cylinder ; so that the curve IJ K Y
shows at every point the rate at which heat is being generated
in the fluid by combustion. It is obvious, then, that combus
tion is not complete at the end of the explosion part of the
curve, although, as Mr. Clerk's experiments prove, the mix
ture of air and gas is in the proper proportions for explosion
immediately behind the piston at all periods of the compres
sion-stroke. The diagram IJKY is specially valuable, as
showing the effect of dissociation of the products of combus
tion at such temperatures as obtain in the gas-engine, and are
shown in Table VIII.
   Postscript, added June 10th.—We have assumed in the
paper that the rate of loss of heat by radiation and convection
is proportional to the difference between the mean temperature
of the fluid and the temperature of the cylinder. When we
have more information concerning the distribution of heat in
the fluid, and the way in which a heated fluid loses its heat to
a cold enclosing vessel, a more accurate assumption may be
made; and it is easy to see what alteration this will introduce
in our method of obtaining the curve XLY (fig. 4).
   It is known from the experiments of MM. Dulong and Petit
that the rate of cooling by radiation and convection of a solid
body increases more rapidly than the difference of tempera
ture, and that it is greater at greater pressures of the gaseous
medium between the hot body and the surrounding coldvessel.

76             On the Gas-Engine Indicator-Diagram.
   We are now engaged in an investigation involving much
higher differences of temperature than those of MM. Dulong
and Petit; and in so far as we have obtained results for tem
peratures extending from about 800° C. to 1300° C, we have
confirmed the conclusions of these gentlemen. Thus the loss
of heat per second at 776° C. being 97-2, the loss at 1292° C.
is 253-2.
    Our method of experimenting is, we believe, new. The
heated body is a spiral of platinum, whose change of electric
resistance when there is change of temperature is known. It
is surrounded by a vessel, blackened inside and maintained at
constant temperature. An electric current is made to pass
through the platinum spiral, maintaining it at any required
temperature. An ammeter and voltmeter enable the current
A and the difference of potentials V between the ends of the
platinum spiral to be measured. Then VA is the rate at
which heat is being radiated from the platinum, and V / A is
the electric resistance of the platinum, from which its tempe
rature is known. We intend to investigate the influence of
high pressures of air and other gases.
    We are somewhat doubtful as to the weight which we
ought to give to the results obtainable from these experiments
on the loss of heat by solid bodies, since in our gas-engine
investigations, we deal with a mixture of hot gases ; and in
adopting the law of simple proportionality to difference of
temperature, we have been influenced by the fact that rate of
loss of heat by the fluid in the compression-stroke increases
much more slowly than is indicated in Dulong and Petit's
 law, although the pressure of the fluid is increasing as well as
its temperature. The result given in § 11 is to the effect that
 during compression the rate of loss of heat by the fluid is
 nearly proportional to the      power of the absolute tempera
 ture of the fluid, or to
                           (0 + 333)H,
 if 6 is the difference of temperature from 60° 0., the tempe
 rature taken as that of the cold cylinder. If q is this rate of
 loss, it is obvious that ^ diminishes as 6 increases.    It will
 be observed that the probability of the piston's having a high
 temperature causes this result to be even more curious than it
 might otherwise appear to be.

rPHESE little volumes are the first two of a series on electro-
      technical subjects announced by the same publisher. Their
appearance is probably due to the recent rush on electric inventions.
The first of these volumes, dealing not only with dynamo-electric
machines, but also with the so-called secondary batteries and with
various kinds of measuring-instruments, is decidedly of the semi-
popular order ; though the formulas and data which it comprises will
doubtless be of advantage to engineers and electricians. The first
hundred pages are purely descriptive of the different kinds of
machines. Switches and secondary batteries take up another forty.
Pages 143 to 172 are occupied in discussing the chief mathematical
laws of the dynamo, including the rules for efficiency given by Sir
W. Thomson, and the arguments of Frolich on the equations for
the current. In the equations there are sundry typographical
errors. After this come short chapters on the construction of the
separate parts ; on the application to electric lighting and other
industrial purposes ; and, lastly, on electrical measuring-instru
ments.
   The second volume possesses both the merits and the defects of
the first. Both are handy, well printed, clearly written; the
second perhaps better than the first. It begins with an argument
on the conservation of energy, and then describes in detail a large
number of forms of electric motor. A considerable section of the
book is given up to a description of the different kinds of cables
and conductors ; and another to the applications made by Deprez
 of the characteristic curves of Hopkinson and Deprez. The author
 appears to doubt whether a dynamo machine can be constructed
 to give a constant potential at the terminals automatically. Secon
 dary batteries come in again as applied to systems of electric
 distribution ; and the work closes with a number of examples of the
 actual employment of electric power in Siemens's electric tramway,
 Hopkinson's electric lift, the recent electric launches, and other
 instances.

              ON THE MAGNETISM OF ORGANIC BODIES.
                BY S. WLEUGEL AND S. HENRICHSEN.
rT,IIE authors have examined the magnetism of some compounds
      of the alcohol radicals C„H2n+1. The bodies in question, which
 were partly prepared by the authors themselves and partly obtained
 from M. Kahlbaum, were all carefully purified before being used.
 For the measurements, they were placed in a small glass vessel.
This was of a somewhat long horizontal shape, and had a bifilar
suspension, so that it oscillated between the pointed half-armatures
of a large horseshoe electromagnet. The current was that of 10-18
Bunsen's elements. The magnetism excited in the bodies was
measured by a torsion method with a mirror reading like that pre
viously used by Gr. Wiedemann. The results are collated in the
following table ; m is here the specific magnetism, that of water
being —100, p is the molecular magnetism, and q the molecular
weight. The negative prefix indicates diamagnetism. The mag
netism of the displaced, air was taken into account.
    The numbers here given are only provisionally to be considered
as correct, as the authors wish once more to test the purity of the
substances used. They are, however, sufficiently trustworthy to
justify several interesting conclusions.

   1. In considering the column fi it will be seen that the intro
duction of CHj into the compound produces an increase in the
molecular magnetism which is almost constant, and the mean value
of which is -1640.
   2. If the chemical formula of a body is at the same time to
indicate its specific magnetism, we can establish the following
equations :—
                  15CH, + 17HO= 32CH,HO,
                  15CH3 + 127I =142CH3l,
                  290,^ + 17110=460,11,, HO,
                  58 C2 H5 + 32 8   = 90 (C, H5)Q S, &c.
   The molecular magnetism of the entire body is thus equal to the
sura of the partial magnetisms of the alcohol radical and of the
other parts of the compound.
   3. In these compounds, HO, I, Br, and 8 have the same specific
magnetism, the mean value of which is —44*3.
   4. On the other hand, it is strange that 01 has a different specific
magnetism of about —61 ; it must, however, be remarked that only
a single chloride was examined. It is nevertheless interesting
that the two acetates give for the radical of acetic acid nearly the
same magnetism as that found for 01—that is, — 63 in the mean.
There is possibly a group of radicals with the specific magnetism
about —62.
   5. Propylic alcohol and isopropylic alcohol show exactly the
same value ; and isobutyric alcohol gives the value which is calcu
lated for butylic alcohol from the law (1). So far as examined,
the alcohol radicals possess the same magnetism in their isomers.
   6. The magnetism of the alcohol radicals is made up of the
atomic magnetisms of the C and H, so that, as in (1), the following
equations may be made :—
                       15CH3 = 12C+3H,
                       29CaH5=24C-|-5H, Ac.
   If we calculate from this C and H, we get for H the rather large
value —780-5, while C is only — 5-6. The latter number is nume
rically so small in comparison with — 780, that no importance can
be assigned to it. The equations are just as well satisfied by C= 0
and H= 807-6.
   The investigations are being continued, and the influence of
temperature will especially be taken into account.—From anAbstract,

 ON THE MANNER IN WHICH THE CURRENT OF AN INDUCTION
    FRICTIONAL MACHINE IS AFFECTED BY THE MOISTURE. BY
    R. KRUGER.
   The results of this investigation may be summarized as follows :—
   1. The connexion between the strength of the current of an in
duction machine and the moisture may be expressed by the formula
                                     V    Po /
in which i is that strength of current which would be obtained if
there were no moisture at all, and p0 is that degree of moisture at
which the machine would not work. This formula holds for any
degree of relative moisture with perfect accuracy.
   2. The constant p0=^^lo is greater as the velocity of rotation
increases ; that is, when the machine is rotated with greater velocity,
its current first disappears at higher degrees of moisture than when
the rotation is less rapid.
   3. The quantity of electricity given by one turn of the plate
when there is no moisture is essentially independent of the velocity
of rotation ; and the quantity of electricity which in this case
passes through the section of the conducting wire amounts to
458,33 . 80" electrostatic units.
   Some observations intended to ascertain how far the current
depends on the distance of the points from the movable plate, and,
on the other hand, on the distance of the plates from each other,

            BOYLE'S LAW. A LECTURE EXPERIMENT.
                          BY J. L. ANDREAE.
   In a glass tube, about a metre long and from 1£ to 2 millim. in
ternal diameter, closed at one end and open below, is introduced
a thread of mercury about 250 millim. in length. This encloses a
certain volume of air, which is about 40 cub. centim.
   The tube is supported on a stand, which has a scale ou white
paper divided in centimetres, and can be placed on the table with
either end vertical. If H is the height of the barometer in milli
metres, the pressure of the enclosed air is P = H— 250. If the
tube is inverted, the pressure is P' = H + 250. If H = 750, P = 500
and P'=1000, so that the volume is reduced from 40 to 20.
   This simple apparatus has the advantage that it is always ready
for use, and hence does not need to have the mercury poured in
as in the usual form.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 6, 1884.

                             [Plate V.]
YARIOUS arrangements for the mixture of colours have
      already been devised by Maxwell, Rayleigh, Helmholtz,
and others, by means of which the laws of colour-combinations
have, in their main features, been firmly established.
   Wishing to observe for myself the principal phenomena
connected with this subject, I have repeated, during the past
winter, many of the experiments thus described, both with the
colour-top and with overlapping spectra. Being desirous of ob
taining some convenient arrangement whereby any two or three
colours of the spectrum could be combined in any required
proportion, and compared with the colours either of natural
objects or of other spectral combinations, I tried various ex
periments, using the method first adopted by Maxwell, of
observing, by means of a slit-eyepiece, the spectra produced
by light proceeding from illuminated slits, and passing through
a train of glass prisms; this method being equivalent to look
ing through a hole in a screen on to which are cast two or
three superposed spectra, so that the colour perceived is that
due to the mixture of those parts of the several spectra which
fall on the hole.
   In these experiments I have been assisted by my colleague
    * Communicated by the Physical Society. Bead June 14, 1884.

  82           Mr. H. H. Hoffert on a new Apparatus
  Mr. Mitchell, to whom I am also indebted for several valuable
  suggestions.
     We first tried a modified form of Maxwell's colour-box,
  using eventually six equilateral glass prisms, arranged in two
  sets of three symmetrically with respect to the eyepiece ; so
  that if the latter be made a source of light, the rays are bent
  through about 150°, and being then received on to a lens, are
  focused on to planes situated on either side of the eyepiece,
  this arrangement being found very convenient for manipu
  lation.
     Movable slits of fixed width, sliding in a frame with bellows-
 screons of opaque silk between, were used as sources of light,
  lamps being placed outside them. The intensity of the light
 was regulated by means of Nicol prisms, one being attached
 to each slit, so as to be capable of rotation, while an analyzing
 Nicol was fixed in the eyepiece. The intensity could thus be
 readily altered for each slit separately.
     This arrangement was found to answer fairly well, but its
 necessarily large dimensions were a great inconvenience. A
 very long spectrum was needed, as the slits could not be
 brought very close on account of the size of the Nicol prisms;
 hence also there was great loss of light.
     Movable slits, whether of fixed or adjustable width, are
 very troublesome to manipulate, and do not admit of very
 rapid and easy adjustment ; they were therefore abandoned
 altogether, and in their place the light from small lengths of
 platinum wire, heated to incandescence by an electric current,
 was employed. Preliminary trials having proved satisfactory,
 the apparatus was constructed which I now bring before your
 notice.
    The prisms, lenses, and sources of light are enclosed in a flat
 box of irregular hexagonal shape, at the smaller end of which
the six prisms (P, PI. V.) are placed. These are arranged, as
already described, in two sets of three, each prism being set
 to minimum deviation. The first prisms have their refracting-
edges in contact; and by means of" a screen (S), in which is a
small rectangular aperture, small equal strips of the adjacent
faces of these prisms are visible from the eyepiece (E), which
is a small brass tube with a narrow slit, about ^ inch wide.
    Supposing light to come from the eyepiece, the prisms
would deflect it through about 150° ; it would then fall on to
two lenses (L), of about 10 inches focal length, which focus
the spectra on to the two sides of the box immediately to the
right and left of the eyepiece. Here are placed the incan
descent wires (W); so that, conversely, if these be the sources
of light, the rays follow an inverse course, and the correspond

                    for Colour- Combinations.                  83
ing half of the aperture in the screen is seen illuminated with
a colour which will depend on the position of the incandescent
wire, and which will be pure and uniform if the wire be not
too thick, the slit in the eyepiece too wide, or the strip of the
prism exposed too large. The colours are found in practice to
be perfectly uniform.
   The prisms and lenses are supported at the level of the in
candescent wires, on a horizontal floor (G), which divides the
box two inches from the top into two compartments, and
which is cut away so as to leave a space for the tops of the
frames carrying the wires to enter the upper compartment.
These frames (W), which are six in number, three on each
side, consist of brass wires held on small ebonite blocks (I),
which slide along a steel rod (H) supported on a ledge inside
the box. The frames can be moved along the length of the
spectrum from outside by means of openings (A) cut in the
sides of the box, into which the hands can be introduced.
These openings are below the level of the horizontal floor, so
that the upper compartment, which is everywhere blackened
inside, is quite impervious to external light, unless the lids in
the cover of the box, to be presently described, are opened.
    The frames are connected by flexible wires to a series of
resistances arranged in the lower compartment of the box; and
by means of six dials (R), on the sides of the box, each of the
six circuits can be altered in resistance at will, so that the
incandescent wires can be rapidly adjusted, whether in position
or in intensity, by the observer without his having to remove
his eye from the eyepiece. Six pairs of binding-screws (T)
 at the back of the box connect the six circuits with a Grove
 battery. By this means, when the current is passing, the
 aperture in the screen is seen divided into two coloured strips
 in close juxtaposition ; one colour being that due to the wires
 and prisms on the right hand, the other to those on the left.
 The colours can thus be readily compared and adjusted to
 exact identity.
    It remains to describe the means by which external colours
 can be introduced for comparison with those produced by the
 prisms.
    The cover of the box contains three small hinged lids. Two
 of these (C) are over the luminous wires, and serve to adjust
 or replace the wires in case of accidental fusion. The third
 lid (D) opens over the space just in front of the screen. Here
 is placed a small strip of microscope cover-glass (M), inclined
 at about 60° to the horizontal, and so arranged that, as seen
  from the eyepiece, it exactly covers that portion of the aper
  ture in the screen which is illuminated by the light from the

 left-hand train of prisms, this light being thus seen through
 the glass slightly diminished in intensity. On the underside
 of the lid is a small silvered mirror (N); and by raising the
 lid to the proper height, the colour of any object laid on the
 top of the box is seen by double reflection in the eyepiece,
 exactly coinciding with the left half of the aperture in the
screen. This colour may be either combined with that from
the left-hand train of prisms, or compared with that from the
 right-hand train. For white light I use the light from a
 window, which may be reduced in intensity to any desired
amount by passing it through one or more pieces of roughened
glass, held in a frame placed on the top of the box. Coloured
glasses, or cells of coloured fluids, can similarly be placed in
the frame, so that almost every possible combination or com
parison of colours may be made. Another frame, which
may be placed inside the box between the screen and the
eyepiece, serves to show the action of different absorbing
media on colours identical in appearance but of different
composition.
    The colours produced are uniform, very constant, and fairly
bright. Those from the blue and violet parts of the spectrum
are necessarily more deficient in luminosity. This is partially
compensated by using in the less luminous parts of the spec
trum ribbons of platinum, produced by rolling out the wires,
with their flat surfaces turned towards the lenses. This is
equivalent to increasing the width of the slit in ordinary
arrangements. Should the wires become fused through in
cautiously using too strong a current, they can be very readily
replaced by means of the screws (K).
    For the current, three Grove's cells are needed for each of
the ribbons and two for each of the wires. But since the
frames carrying the wires can be brought together till the
wires are nearly in contact, and since the wires themselves
offer extremely narrow luminous surfaces, a very long spec
trum is not needed ; and by using more powerful lenses and
bringing the sliding frames closer to them, a greater intensity
of light would result; while the size of the box might thus be
reduced to one half or even less of its present amount, the
eyepiece being kept at a sufficient distance by the use of a
longer tube, which might be made removable. One Grove
cell would then suffice for each wire, or at most two when
experimenting on the violet rays.
    Instead of the step-by-step dial-resistances, some arrange
ment giving, like the rheostat, a gradual adjustment of the
intensity would be perhaps preferable.

  show the exact position in the spectrum of each of the luminous
   wires.
      I trust that the ease and rapidity with which the adjust
  ments in this apparatus can be made will cause it to be found
  useful in those many cases in which it is impossible or incon
  venient to make use of the more powerful effect of direct
, sunlight.

  6.          the Nature of the Kathode-rays.—I showed, in my first
             paper on the Electric Discharge, that the kathode-rays
  cannot take any important part in the formation of the current
  and in the transport of the electricity. The strength of the
  current in a circuit in which a discharge-tube is included
  remained sensibly the same, whether the kathode-rays were
  allowed to radiate freely, or whether they were received upon
  a mica-screen. Recent experiments carried out by other
  methods by Hertz * lead to exactly the same result.
      What conception, then, are we to form of the kathode-rays?
      In the memoir referred to above, I have endeavoured to
  show that the view held by Crookes, Puluj, and others,
  according to which the kathode-rays consist of particles
  separated from the electrode and projected from it, cannot
  be sustained. Other reasons are given by Hertz and Gold-
  steinf. Notwithstanding Herr Puluj, in later publications,
  without making any experiment to set aside our objections,
  and sometimes without even referring to them, insists upon
  his old views. The carrying of particles of the electrode
  along the kathode-rays is a secondary phenomenon, which
  has just as little to do with propagation of the motion which
  corresponds to it as the flight of a cannon-ball has to do with
  the radiation of the sound produced by the explosion. I

  der Physik, 1880, to my paper published in Wied. Ann. x. p. 802, Herr
  Goldstein asserts that I had incorrectly deduced arguments against motion
  in the kathode-rays from the experiments of Wheatstone and Von Zahr,
  and makes objection to them. But an attentive reading of the passage
  shows that I am considering only motion in the ordinary current, as
  is seen for example from the remark on p. 246 :—" These considerations,
  which I had already used, Wied. Ann. ix. p. 160, to show that the trans
  port of particles takes place in the direction of the current, Herr Goldstein
  has also repeatedly made use of in describing the processes which take
  place at the negative electrode."

86                     Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
believe we may explain all the peculiarities of the kathode-
rays, in accordance with the views already expressed, by
assuming that the kathode-rays represent light rays of very
small oscillation-period *.
      (1) From experiments by E. Goldstein f, which have
been confirmed partly by myselfj, partly by Spottiswoode
and Moulton §, it may be shown that the motions in the »
kathode-rays must certainly be supposed to be orientated in
a certain way to the rays themselves. The experiments
showed that the katliodo-rays can traverse the positive light
 without hindrance if their motion of direction coincides with
 that of the positive light, and, further, that if a point of the wall
be connected with the ground, and thus a kathode be pro
 duced at that point, shadows of the positive stratifications are
thrown by the rays issuing from the wall. In this arrange
ment of the experiment the kathode-rays traverse the positive
 column of light at right angles. The experiments first men
tioned show that we cannot, with Spottiswoode and Moulton,
 explain the phenomenon by supposing that larger quantities
of matter are accumulated in the stratifications than in the
 dark spaces between them.              For when the kathode-rays
 traverse the stratifications longitudinally, they must pass
through larger quantities of matter than when this takes
place transversely.
     Since, then, in the second case we have a mutual disturb
ance and not in the first, we must conclude that the motions
of the kathode-rays and of the positive discharge are opposite
in direction. Since further disturbances occur, especially in
motions which take place parallel to each other, the motion in
the kathode-rays must be at right angles to that in the posi
tive light. We may imagine the motion in the positive light
as produced by a dielectric polarization which issues from the
positive electrode, and which is then followed by a current of
positive electricity || . This motion is certainly longitudinal ; the
   * That the kathode-rays consist of waves in the tether, I have en
deavoured to show in Wied. Ann. ix. p. 100, and Wied. Ann. x. p. 251.
Messrs. Goldstein and Hertz have signified their adherence to this view.
   In a recently published paper Herr Goldstein asserts that he was the
first who considered the electric discharge as a motion of aether. This is
not quite correct, as already in the year 1797 Gren had the same view for
the electric light in the vacuum of the barometer. As far as I can see
I was the first who tried to explain from that conception the several
phenomena.

  motion in the kathode-rays consequently transverse. The ab
  sorption of the kathode-rays is not, however, to be conceived
  as interference in the usual sense of the word, but rather as
  a transference of motion to other particles already moving
  in the same direction.
     (2) Let us now turn to the property possessed by the
  kathode-rays, that they cannot traverse any larger layers of
 matter, i. e. to the absorption of the kathode-rays.
     We find that every solid body, whether conductor or insu
 lator, is absolutely opaque to the kathode-rays even in the
 thinnest films. Hertz (loc. cit.) has shown that sodium or
 mercury vapour introduced into the path of the kathode-rays
 opposed an absolute hindrance to their further progress; and
 he supposes that the non-appearance of the kathode-rays at
 higher pressures depends upon their absorption by the gas
 itself.
    An absorption of the ultra-violet rays has been proved deci
 sively by Cornu*; no experiments with hydrogen are yet at
 our disposal; but an increased absorption in the ultra-violet
 is probable on spectroscopic grounds.
     It is also it priori probable that a general absorption of
 the rays of light takes place so much the more easily the
 smaller their oscillation-period, or the greater the number
of vibrations performed during the time that the ray of
light advances through a given distance. There will be an
 absorption if certain relationships exist between the oscil
 lations of the tether envelopes of the molecules and those of
 the free aether in respect to period and direction of oscilla
 tion; it is clear that with similar conditions of the body, such
 will occur the more frequently the greater the number of
sethereal oscillations per unit length. The strength of the
absorption must, cwteris paribus, be proportional to the pro
duct of the number of ajthereal oscillations per unit-length
and the number of molecules in the unit volume. Hence the
 number of bodies which yield a continuous absorption-spec
trum in the ultra-violet is much greater than the number of
those which absorb both the visible rays and also the ultra
violet rays.
    (3) With the absorption of the rays is closely connected the
facility with which they produce phosphorescence and fluores
cence f, and with which they initiate chemical change.
    It is this fluorescent or phosphorescent luminosity of a gas
   » C. X. lxxxviii. p. 1285 (1879); Beibl. iv. p. 40 (1880).
   t The opinion of Herr Goldstein that the ends of the kathode-rays,
when they strike upon a solid wall, become covered with a layer of ultra
violet light does not appear to me to be very probable.

88                    Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
traversed by the kathode-rays which enables us to trace the
course of the rays. The aether envelopes of the gas-molecules
upon which they strike are thrown into vibration and emit
light. Since the kathode-rays possess in themselves very
great energy, and therefore when absorbed yield up a large
amount of energy, it does not appear remarkable that hydrogen
in the kathode-rays shows the line-spectrum and not the band-
spectrum, that in nitrogen we have a prevailing blue colour,
and so on.
   With strongly decreasing pressure the brilliancy of the
kathode-rays decreases because the number of luminous gas-
particles is lessened.
    (4) We find when a negative electrode is produced, whether
by directly communicating negative electricity or by con
necting the wall with the earth at the point in question, and
thus condensing positive electricity, that metallic electrodes
generally, and the glass wall always, become covered with a
luminous glow, which, upon spectroscopic examination, shows
the sodium-lines and the hydrogen-lines, especially the red
one, whilst in the kathode-rays themselves, as already men
tioned, the blue part of the spectrum predominates. It is in
the highest degree improbable, however, that there is always
produced at the secondary kathodes on the way a temperature
so high as corresponds to the dissociation of vapour-steam. The
very lively aether motions produced at the point of origin of the
kathode-rays will no doubt here also call forth primary aether
 motions in the solid body, which will then secondarily produce
 dissociation and rise of temperature. Since at the electrode
 itself the number of molecules is greater than in the tube, and
 the wall continuously absorbs energy, the gas itself can only
 absorb a relatively smaller amount of energy per molecule than
 in the free gas-space; hence here also the red hydrogen-lines
 are relatively brighter than in the kathode-rays themselves.
     (5) The phenomenon discovered by myself*, and called by
 Goldsteinf reflection of the kathode-rays, is at once accounted
 for by the fact that they are rays of light,
     (6) The " deflection " fully examined by Goldsteinf consists
 in a bending which the kathode-rays suffer when they pass
 near another kathode. The phenomenon is exactly similar
 to that which occurs when a ray of light passes near a bodv
 which is surrounded by an atmosphere the density of which
 decreases from within outwardly, or which is of variable

pressure. In fact, in accordance with what has been explained
above as to the resistance of the positive light, there exists
round the electrode a space, varying from within outwards,
which may very well produce such deflections in rays which
traverse it.
   (7) The mechanical action of the kathode-rays, such as
movements of surfaces upon which they impinge, so far as
they do not arise from the thermal phenomena, is seen from
Maxwell's results, according to which a ray of light exerts on
the wave-front a pressure which is numerically equal to the
energy in the unit volume.
   I have previously calculated concerning the heating which
takes place at the kathode how high a value this energy
may possess, of which an idea may be formed from the fact,
amongst others, that in the focus of a hemispherical kathode,
as is well known, platinum-foil is heated to intense glow, and
glass is melted. For this last phenomenon it is important that
in the highly exhausted space the heat yielded by the kathode-
rays to the foil shall be given up to the surrounding air by
convection only with extreme slowness.
    (8) The mutual repulsion of two kathode-rays as observed
by Crookes, and which, as I have been able to observe, actually
occurs under the conditions which he states, i. e. with strong
discharges and when the rays form a small angle with each
other, whereas the rays cross when they meet under a larger
angle, may be explained by the pressure exerted on the wave-
front of the ray of light.
    (9) Hertz has already (loc. cit.) pointed out the possible
 connexion of the deflection of the kathode-rays with the
 rotation of the plane of polarization ; without, however, ex
 pressing a definite opinion. I believe that with the above
 assumption as to the nature of the kathode-rays, the two phe
 nomena will be found to be related in a definite manner.
    Let S N (fig. 9) be a magnet along whose axis a ray of
 light is sent, vibrating, we will suppose, in the plane of the
 paper; then, if we place a piece of glass before the north
 pole, the vibrations are disturbed so that the upper part of the
 ray is rotated forwards.
    If, now, we imagine the ray moving in a direction at right
 angles to the plane of the paper, instead of the direction S N,
 a similar rotation must take place, for the position of the
 aether-vibrations relative to the magnet remains unaltered.
 But the ray of light must always be at right angles to the
 direction of vibration. If, therefore, this be rotated, the ray
 of light must also be rotated, or it suffers a deflection, the ray
 being elevated from N onwards.

  90                 Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
     The fact that these rotations have not yet been observed
  in air, although with the kathode-rays they attain so high a
  value, may be to some extent accounted for as follows.
     The rotation of the plane of polarization a is expressed,
  other conditions being unchanged, by the formula
                          _A , B ,
  where A, B, &c. are constants, and X denotes the wave-length.
  a attains a greater value the smaller X is; and it increases
  much more rapidly than \ does.
     But this cannot be the whole of the explanation of the
  difference in behaviour between the kathode-rays and ordi
 nary rays of light. If the rotation of the vibrations of light
  were equally great, whether it takes place in the plane passing
 through them and the ray of light, or in a plane at right angles
 to this, then this rotation could certainly be distinctly observed
 by placing a cylinder of Faraday's glass equatorially between
 the poles of a powerful electromagnet, and sending through
 it a ray of light coming from a slit through a collimator, and
 observed with a telescope provided with cross-wires. Expe
 riments for this purpose have, however, given only negative
 results.
    7. On tlie Positive Discharge and the Formation of Stratifica
 tions.—I propose to describe in few words a theory I have
 formed as to the cause of the stratifications, which affords an
 explanation of a series of phenomena, and with the further
 development of which I am now occupied.
    There is formed round the negative electrode, as we have
seen, a space in which the gas is in a condition altogether
 different from that in the rest of the tube. There is a dielec
 tric polarization at the positive electrode, which undergoes
a change when the discharge takes place: this (and not a
 sound-wave) is transmitted, and is followed by a current of
free electricity*. When this advancing dielectric polarization
 reaches the neighbourhood of the kathode, it, like any other
 tension, is reflected, and the return-wave produces interfe
rence; the following electricity finds therefore places of maxi
mum and minimum motion; in the first it will behave in a
different way than in the latter: in the first, therefore, the
gas is seen to be luminous, in the second not.
    Since the anode itself must always be a point of maximum
motion, it corresponds to a layer, a bright point, oven when
the distance of the anode from the reflecting parts of the
   * Compare the conclusions in Wied. Ann. x. p. 245, and the reclama
tion of W. Siemens, Wied. Ann. xxix. p. 117 (1880).

                   Electric Discharge in Gases.                91
kathode has become so small that no interference could take
place any more; hence we find the end of the positive elec
trode still covered by a cap of light, even where it has broken
through the last layer.
   We must not, however, conceive of the point at which
reflection takes place as an infinitely thin layer, but one of
perceptible breadth which extends from the boundary of the
bright kathode-layer on the side of the kathode to the positive
light. The broader this layer becomes, the broader must also
be the places of maximum motion, and conversely: thus we
find with high pressures and a narrow bright kathode-layer,
well-defined narrow stratifications; with low pressures and
broad kathode-layer, the stratifications are diffuse; the distri
bution of light in the stratifications is also explained.
    If too large quantities of electricity accumulate on the
anode, or if the current is too rapid, then, in consequence of
the irregular motion, no stratifications are formed.
   The idea of Herr Goldstein that each separate layer behaves
as a conducting element with anode and kathode, seems to me
to be only a mode of describing certain phenomena observed
in the stratifications, but not to furnish an explanation of
them. The anode and kathode of a layer would, in this way of
regarding the matter, have to be considered as the points of
entrance and exit of electricity in layers of gas in a peculiar
 condition of motion or of tension.
    It might be supposed that certain difficulties would present
themselves to this explanation, in cases where the positive
electrode is in connexion with the earth, and the negative
 connected with the source of electricity.
    I am inclined to think that the phenomena in this case may
be explained as follows. Under the influence of the electricity
accumulated on the negative electrode, or of positive with
 drawn from it, there is produced a dielectric polarization start
ing from the luminous kathode-layer surrounding it. The
 high resistance which experiment shows to exist is opposed
 by the dark kathode-layer to the neutralization of electricity
 in the direction of the negative electrode. The dielectric
polarization therefore spreads out towards the positive elec
 trode, where occurs a condensation of free electricity. As
 soon as its tension bas risen sufficiently, the discharge occurs
 in the manner described above. The much more regular for
 mation of stratifications observed in this case has its ground in
the small quantity of free electricity accumulated upon the
positive electrode, which flows off much more regularly than
when new quantities of electricity pass continually from the
 source of electricity to the electrode.

92                 Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
   8. FurtJier Observations upon the Influence ofthe Magnet upon
the Discharge.—A series of measurements and observations
were made upon the behaviour of the discharge under the influ
ence of feeble magnets. These have led to results which partly
differ from those of previous observers, partly complete them.
   I employed for these experiments a tube 25 millim. wide
and 410 millim. long, with plate-electrodes which Lad been
highly exhausted.
   The kathode k (fig. 3) was insulated and connected with the
negative pole; the electrode a, on the other hand, was con
nected with the earth by a long moist thread, as well as to the
positive pole of the machine. A dark space appeared about
k, which extended to b; this was traversed by the kathode-
rays, which issued in a narrow, slightly divergent pencil from
the centre of the plate h. Up to the middle of the space h b
these were of a white colour; but afterwards more of a blue
colour. From b itself issued from the whole surface of
the corresponding kathode-layer a bluish luminosity — the
"glow-rays," through which the kathode-rays could be traced.
Three or four cloudy stratifications were visible about a. The
tube showed from b to a a bright-green light on the walls,
so that here also the peculiar kathode-rays penetrate the posi-
sitive light without meeting with any hindrance whatever,
and the positive light can also diffuse itself through the
kathode-rays unhindered. If the one pole of a bar-magnet be
brought near such a tube, green light becomes visible on the
wall, which shows that the kathode-rays-and the blue " glow-
light " are, as we know, so deflected that a north pole placed
under the tube throws them to the right, if we are looking
from the positive electrode towards the negative.
   But these phenomena are seen still more clearly if, instead
of a bar-magnet, we employ a horseshoe-magnet with poles as
close to each other as possible (best a small lamellar magnet
of Jamin's construction), placing it so that the tube occupies
the equatorial position.
   We must distinguish two cases:—(1) Both poles of the
magnet produce a deflection of the discharge, such that the
" glow-light " and the kathode-rays are deflected on each side
towards the walls; or (2) both poles deflect the rays towards
the centre of the tube.
   (1) In the first case, if the magnet is placed between the
anode and the boundary of the dark space, there is seen on the
wall a green spot of light bounded by two ellipses. These
ellipses are produced by planes intersecting the tube and in
clined to its axis. The form is that represented in fig. 10; c
is the luminous surface, af and b d its boundaries. The boun

                   Electric Discharge in Gases.                93
dary furthest from the negative electrode is the brighter, but
both are equally sharply denned. The line of light db does
not reach quite to the end of af, but cuts this line. Also the
line af does not extend quite round the tube, but ends where
the magnet is, bending a little so as to become more nearly
parallel to the axis of the tube. If the magnet is moved from
the anode towards the kathode, the two boundaries approach
each other the more closely the nearer the magnet comes to the
negative electrode, until at last they coincide. Notwithstanding,
so long as the magnet-pole is not close to the limit of the dark
kathode-layer (in one case so long as it was not nearer than
about 12 millim.), the inclination of the green ring to the axis
of the tube from the positive electrode remains constant, and
                                          25
in the above case amounted to tan-1^. But if the magnet
approaches the dark layer, the inclination decreases consider
ably, and at the boundary of the dark space attains the value
        25
tan-1^. When the magnet-pole has somewhat overpassed
the limit of the dark kathode-space, the luminous figure
becomes indistinct, reducing itself to a spot of light, and this
recedes farther from the pole as the magnet approaches the
electrode.
   The phenomenon appears at all pressures within certain
limits. The distance of the magnet from the electrode, beyond
which the deflection is of such a nature that the half-moon
shaped figures are produced, is greater the greater the exhaus
tion, evidently because the dark space extends continually
further and further.
   If we examine the deflection of the kathode-rays more closely,
we find that it only takes place from the point where the white
colour changes into blue. But since the deflection of the ring
is so much dependent upon the position of the magnet relative
to the electrode, and there is scarcely any ring formed when
the magnet is behind the limit of the glow-light, we see that the
kathode-rays behave altogether differently within the dark
space. And when they have once traversed it they offer, in
the first position, a much greater resistance to all lateral dis
placement.
    It is very probable that the glow-rays which are beyond the
dark space play some part in the formation of the green ring.
    (2) In the second case, where both magnet-poles a and b
deflect the rays towards the centre so that they are there com
pressed, there appears a bright strip of light which, starting
from the line joining the poles, extends towards the positive

94                  Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
electrode, ltsformissomewhatthatoffig.il. It is sharply-
defined from the neighbourhood of the magnet to S, where its
two bounding lines meet; from there on, it is accompanied by
somewhat diffused light.
    The phenomenon also appears most distinctly when the
magnet-poles are at some distance from the kathode. Peculiar
phenomena are observed when, having produced the sickle-
shaped figure by means of a magnet placed under the tube, we
bring the one pole of a bar-magnet near to the tube from above.
The inner, weaker border undergoes only slight displacement,
but the outer, stronger border is greatly deformed. The con
tour is shown in fig.12: .... shows the weaker boundary nearest
the kathode,         the stronger boundary seen upon the wall of
the tube. The portion n m was, to begin with, upon the same
side of the tube upon which it still is; but the portion m I is
bent over from the other side of the tube, and has thus experi
enced a rotation of nearly 1 80°.
    The weaker boundary is therefore produced by rays which
 resist bending and deflection much more than those which
 produce the stronger boundary.
    In the above description no notice has been taken of the
 behaviour of the positive column of light. We turn now to
 consider it.
    If we move the Jamin magnet, in its equatorial position,
 along the tube from the positive pole, the stratifications preserve
 their position almost unaltered, although the green ring is
 already visible, until the centre of the plane passing through
 the ring cuts the first layer. At this moment it disappears,
 uniting with the second; so that this becomes the first. This
 itself then gradually advances with the magnet, and indeed
 in proportion as the glow-rays are bent to the side, while new
 layers continually appear from the anode. If we move the
 magnet backwards, we find that the first layer divides as soon
 as it has passed the ring.
     In most cases the persistent first anode-layer, as described
 above, appears under the influence of the magnet. In some
 cases, under conditions which I have not been able completely
 to determine, we observe a simple displacement of the first
 layer, whilst, however, there was always noticed a consider
 able expansion, e. g. with retrograde motion of the magnet,
  corresponding to the previously mentioned division, and sub-
  quent shortening of the layer.
     If the magnet in its motion reaches the limit of the dark
  space, the first positive layer remains stationary for a moment;
  and then, upon a further approach of the magnet to the kathode,
  retreats, whilst at the same time the kathode-rays and glow

                  Electric Discharge in Gases.                95
rays penetrate further into the tube, thus conditioning the
first phenomenon.
   The usual description of the phenomenon, according to which
the positive-light column is simply attracted to the magnet,
whilst new stratifications continually disengage themselves
from the positive electrode, whilst the first remains unchanged
and moves toward the kathode, therefore does not always apply.
   9. Behaviour of Poor Conductors as Kathodes.—A few ex
periments relate to the behaviour of bad conductors as kathodes.
The questions to be decided were, first of all, whether such
poor conductors would be disintegrated in the same way as
good conductors, whether kathode-rays would appear, &c.
Paper and similar substances have been previously employed
as poor conductors, and the electrodes have been covered with
these substances. I have not employed these substances; for
so long as they are not perfectly dry, no vacuum at all perfect
can be obtained with them ; and if they are perfectly dry,
they are insulators which can only be broken through in dis
ruptive discharges.
   1 have therefore used lead chloride and lead iodide, which
at ordinary temperatures conduct very badly. In order to
cover the electrodes with these substances, the discharge-tube
was made of the form shown in fig. 13. An aluminium elec
trode is melted into one end of the tube in the ordinary-
manner, whilst at the other end at d a narrow tube was melted
on. In this a still smaller glass tube 8 fitted exactly. A
platinum wire was melted into one end a, into which a drop
of mercury (/8) was brought; and an aluminium wire (7) was
pushed into the tube and dipped in the mercury. In the
part e of 8 not occupied by the aluminium wire, chloride or
iodide of lead was melted until the space e was completely
filled, when the tube 8 was pushed into the tube c and cemented
with sealing-wax. The electrode is completely covered by
glass and not by cement, so that it does not need further
melting in. This arrangement may be recommended, mutatis
mutandis, for the construction of other forms of discharge-
apparatus.
    With chloride or iodide of lead fine kathode-rays were ob
tained accompanied by a very decided deposit upon the walls,
and especially upon the parts within the dark space round the
kathode, although the kathode-rays traversed the tube alto
gether in the line of the axis. This deposit showed Newton's
rings plainly, and formed very rapidly. Whether its formation
is attended by electrolytic decomposition of the lead-salt
remains to be investigated. When iodide of lead is used,
peculiar spectral phenomena are observed, the description of

96                Prof. E. Wiedemann on the
which must be reserved for a later paper. We see thus that
kathodes formed of poor conductors do become disintegrated.
   10. Dependence of the Potential ofDischarge upon the Form
of the Electrode.—A series of experiments were made to de
termine in particular tubes how the potential necessary to
initiate the discharge depends upon the form of the electrodes.
All the tubes were of the same size, 25 millim. wide and
120 millim. long. The first tube contained two plates, the
second two points, and the third a point and a plate at a dis
tance apart of 58 millim.
   The first result obtained was that, if the three tubes are
connected with the positive and negative poles of the machine
side by side at pressures exceeding 1 millim., the discharge
passed only in the tube with the point* ; at lower pressures
only in that with the plates.
   A second mode of experiment consisted in using one tube
only, but including a spark-micrometer in a second parallel
circuit, and then gradually separating the balls of the micro
meter until the discharge passed through the tube, or by
bringing the balls nearer to each other from a considerable
distance until the discharge took place between the balls.
In the last case the distance is always greater than in the first,
partly because the discharge between the balls of the micro
meter takes place more easily when the air between them has
been heated and rarefied by the stream of sparks, an 1 partly
because the walls of the glass tube become charged; and it
therefore requires a higher potential to produce the first dis
charge through the tube than is necessary for the following
ones.
   The experiment showed next that connecting either of the
electrodes with the earth is without any important effect.
   At verv low pressures the following results were obtained: —
   (1) With the tube with two points the spark-distance might
be increased to 9 millim. without the discharge taking place.
(2) With the tube with one plate and one point, if the plate
was negative, no discharge took place in the tube, even when
the spark-distance amounted to 11 millim.; but if the plate
was positive, the discharge occurred at a distance of 3 millim.
(3) If both electrodes were plates, discharges took place at
a spark-distance of 2 millim.
   Hence it follows that a greater potential is necessary for
the discharge between two points than between two plates,
and that part is taken not only by the negative electrode, but
also by the positive.
   An altogether peculiar phenomenon manifests itself if we
employ a tube of the form shown in fig. 14, making the small

electrode a, cut. off close to the glass, the kathode, and the large
electrode the anode: a pencil of kathode-rays issues from the
point of the kathode; and we find also the glass tube sur
rounding it shows bright-green fluorescence, as if the wall of
the tubo about a had become a kathode. The explanation is
to be found in the fact that the electricity issuing from the
anode cannot make its way through the small surface of the
kathode, and flows towards the wall about a, which therefore
acts as a kathode.
   11. Remarks upon the Management of Electrophoric, Ma
chines.—With the consent of Herr Hofrath and Dr. Topler,
I add the following remarks:—When an electrophoric machine
has been used for a long time, it often becomes useless on
account of the dust deposited upon it and burnt into the layer
of varnish; and this has to bo renewed, which is troublesome,
and does not always answer, since the glass of the plates them
selves is often attacked. Herr Topler proposes to cover the
plates with a layer of paraffin, which can easily be prepared and
renewed. The fixed plates are dipped into melted paraffin con
tained in a tin vessel large enough to take the plate. In order
to cover the rotating plates, a tin vessel is used into which
three or four can be plunged up to the centre, filled with melted
paraffin, and the plates plunged in while they are rotated,
without being removed from the axle. It is advantageous to
heat the plates as much as possible before dipping them in, by
means of the heating-apparatus provided with the machine,
in order to avoid all risk of the plates cracking. The super
fluous paraffin is removed by rapid rotation of the plates after
removal from the paraffin-bath.
   If after long use the plates become dusty again and covered
with metallic particles from the points, it is sufficient to heat
them on the machine so as to melt the paraffin and cover up
the dust. After a long time an entire renewal of the paraffin
will be necessary.
   In working for a length of time with electrophoric machines,
it is not advisable to have them in the laboratory. Ozone is a
poisonous gas, and is the more dangerous because its evil effects
are not perceived at once; on the contrary, breathing it appears
at first to be attended by increased animation, but afterwards
it produces evil effects upon the nervous system. Thus Binz*
has shown that it produces sleep.
   My best thanks aro duo to Mr. Colo, of Cambridge, U.S.A.,
who has assisted me in these experiments with the greatest
zeal.

XI. On a Method of Measuring the Electrical Capacity of a
   Condenser, and on the Determination by Electrical Observa
   tions of the Period of a Tuning-fork. By R. T. Glaze-
   BBOOK, M.A., F.R.S., Demonstrator of Experimental Physics
   at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge* .
THE experiments described in the following paper were
       undertaken at the request of Messrs. Latimer Clark,
Muirhead, and Co., for the purpose of testing one of their
condensers " which," quoting from a letter from the firm,
" has lately been made and which we use in the factory. In
its construction it is the same as all our condensers, and is
made of sheets of mica and tinfoil and laid with paraffin-wax."
   The method employed was a modification of one given by
Maxwell (vol. ii. § 776), and used by J. J. Thomson (Phil.
Trans, iii. 1883) in his recent determination. The following
is his description of the arrangement :—
   " In a Wheatstone bridge, ABCD (fig. 1), with the galva
nometer at G and the battery be
tween A and B, the circuit B D is
not closed, but the points B and D
are connected with two poles, Ii and
S, of a commutator, between which
a travelling piece, P, moves back
wards and forwards. P is connected
with one plate of a condenser, the
other plate of which is connected
with D. Thus, when P is in con
tact with S the condenser will be
charged, and until it is fully charged
electricity will flow into it from the battery : this will produce
a momentary current through the various arms of the bridge.
When the moving piece P is in contact with R, the two plates
of the condenser are connected, and the condenser will dis
charge itself through D R ; and as the resistance of D R is
infinitesimal in comparison with the resistance in any other
circuit, the discharge of the condenser will not send an appre
ciable amount of electricity through the galvanometer. Thus,
if we make the moving piece P oscillate quickly from R to S,
there will, owing to the flow of electricity to the condenser, be
a succession of momentary currents through the galvanometer.
The resistances are so adjusted that the deflection of the gal
vanometer produced by these momentary currents is balanced

by the deflection due to the steady current, and the resultant
deflection is zero. When this is the case, there is a relation
between the capacity of the condenser, the number of times
the condenser is charged and discharged in a second, and the
resistances in the various arms of the bridge."           ,
   The investigation given by Maxwell is only approximate ;
we shall quote therefore the result given in Thomson's paper.

   The commutator was the one used by J. J. Thomson, and
we will quote his description : —" The current from some
Grove cells passes first through a tuning-fork interrupter and
then through the coils L M (fig. 2) of an electromagnet.

100           Mr. E. T. Glazebrook on a Method of
the elasticity of the rod P N makes it press against the
screw T, which is electrically connected with the binding-
screw R. When the current passes through the electromagnet,
the magnet attracts the iron attached to the rod P N and
brings it into connexion with the stop G, which is electrically
connected with the binding-screw S. The letters P R S indi
cate the same points in this figure as in fig. 1. All the places
where contact is made are covered with platinum, and the
whole arrangement is fastened down to an ebonite board. As
the current passes intermittently through the coils L M of the
electromagnet, the vibrating-piece P N strikes alternately
against the parts Gr and T. When it strikes against G, the
opposite plates of the condenser are connected with the two
poles of the battery; when it strikes against T, the condenser
is discharged."
   The main advantages of this method over the one ordinarily
employed for the determination of the capacity of a condenser
whose capacity is comparable with a microfarad are easily
seen. In the first place it is a null method ; no assumptions
are required as to the constancy of the battery. In the
second, the galvanometer can readily be made much more
sensitive. For accurate work in the ordinary method, the
field of force in which the galvanometer-needle hangs should
be nearly uniform. The earth's force is much too strong,
unless an enormous battery-power be employed, and it is
difficult to secure a uniform field by a control magnet.
Something may of course be done by the use of an astatic
galvanometer-needle; but it is impossible to increase the
sensitiveness in this way very much, because the torsion of the
suspending fibro then becomes important. Again, in the
ordinary method the time of swing cannot be determined
accurately if it be made too small; the moment of inertia of
the suspended parts therefore must be considerable, and the
deflection produced by a given quantity of electricity suddenly
discharged through the galvanometer is proportionately de
creased ; for, if T be the time of swing, 0 the throw produced
by a quantity of electricity Q, then T sin £ 6 is proportional
to Q. In addition to this, there is the correction for damping
which has to be considered.
   On the other hand, objections may be raised to the method
which has just been described. The most important of these
is founded on the fact that the time during which the plates
of the condenser are in contact either with each other or with
the poles of the battery is very short. It may happen, then,
that the condenser is neither charged nor discharged com
pletely at each vibration of the commutator; while if there be

       Measuring the Electrical Capacity of a Condenser.      101
any electrical absorption in the condenser, its effects will
depend on the time during which the contact lasts. The
experiments to be described were undertaken with the view
of testing the method for these defects. The time during
which the plates of the condensers are connected with the
battery is the time during which the spring P N is in contact
with G. This is only a fraction of the period of the tuning-
fork which governs the commutator, a fraction which depends
on the distance between the end of the screw T and the point
G, and on the strength of the current in the electromagnet.
   A series of experiments were made to test the effect of
varying the position of the screw T, keeping the battery the
same. In these, four Leclanche cells were used in the battery-
circuit A B, and two pint Groves to drive the commutator.
The position of the spot of light on the scale was noted, and
then the value of the resistance d adjusted until no deflection
was produced when the galvanometer-circuit was closed by
means of a key.
   The commutator, when working correctly, emitted a defi
nite sound which was readily recognized; and it was found
that the screw T could be adjusted within certain limits without
altering this sound.
   Table I. gives the results of these observations.
                            Table I.

      Screw T loosened one turn. Spot off scale.
      Screw T readjusted, note good                     906
   Thus the value of d required to give a balance is prac
tically the same throughout, and the commutator with a defi
nite battery-power can readily be set to give a definite-
result ; moreover, a balance could never be obtained except
with the resistance 905 or 906. In the fourth observation
 the note of the commutator was marked as bad ; but the spot
 remained stationary, showing that though there seemed to bo
a slight irregularity in the sound, it was too small to affect
 the balance. The sensitiveness was such that an alteration in
d of 1 B.A. unit produced a deflection of from two to three
scale-divisions. The number of vibrations of the fork was
about 32 per second.

102            Mr. R. T. Glazebrook on a Method of
    Another set of observations was then taken to test the
effect of varying the battery-power driving the commutator,
thus altering the force with wnich the spring PN is attracted
to G, three Grove cells being used in place of two. The
values of d found in two separate observations were 905'5
and 905.
     Observations were made to test the effect of varying
the period of the driving-fork. Forks of frequencies of ap
proximately 16, 32, 64, and 128 to the second were taken,
and the pitch of the lowest of these determined absolutely by
 comparison with the clock in the method described by Lord
 Rayleigh (' Nature/ xvii. p. 12; Phil. Trans. 1883, Pt.I.). This
 fork and the 32 fork were then set going on independent cir
 cuits, and a pointer attached to the 32 fork was watched over
 the top of a plate of thin metal which had been all along fixed
 on to the 16 fork, the eye being placed so that this pointer was
 visible for only one position of the 16 fork in each vibration.
 In this way the beats between the octave of the 16 fork and
 the 32 fork were visible, and could easily be counted.
     Thus the period of the 32 fork was found, and then in a similar
 manner those of the 64 and 128 forks. By loading with wax
 one of the two forks under comparison, it was easy to find
 which of the two was gaining.
     Each of these forks was used in turn to drive the commu
 tator, and the value of the capacity calculated from the
 observations. The values of the resistances were as follows:—
     a was a standard coil of 10 B.A. units, d a resistance of
 1000 B.A. units, taken from a box by Messrs. Elliott, Bros.,
 and c a variable resistance from another box by the same firm.
      g, the galvanometer-resistance, was about 11,000 B.A.
 units ; and b, the battery-resistance, from 5 to 6 B.A. units.
 The galvanometer-resistance was higher than necessary, but
 it. was for other reasons the most convenient instrument for
 the purpose. The value of c varied from about 1800 to about
 240 B.A. units.
     It will be found that, with these values, the equation giving
 the capacity may be written

deflection of about one scale-division in the spot of light.

to about 5 in 3300, or about 1 in 660 ; and there is no
trace visible of variation in the capacity with the time of

and                            C = *3336 microfarad.
   This value supposes that the various coils used have their
nominal resistance in B.A. units. And this assumption is
correct, at any rate to 1 in 1000. Thus it seems that the
method gives satisfactory results, and may safely be used to
determine the capacity of a condenser.
   But the converse of the method may be even more useful.
The fundamental equation gives us C if we know n and the
resistances; it will equally give us n if we know C and the
resistances; and in many cases this may be the readiest
method of finding n, especially if the period is too long to
give an audible note. Thus in the above experiments I require
to adjust a fork to vibrato about 16 times a second, the lowest
1 could obtain being one of a frequency of almost 20.

             On Salt-Solutions and Attached Water.            105
   I made observations with the 32 fork, the pitch of which
was marked on it by the maker, of the value of c required
to produce a balance, then doubled this value of c, and set the
fork which it was required to adjust to drive the commutator.
Leaden weights were then fixed with screws on to the prongs
of the fork, and their position was adjusted until the galvano
meter-balance was not disturbed on making contact. It was
clear, then, from the approximate formula that the frequency
of the fork was very nearly 1 6. And on making the comparison
with the clock, it was found to be 15*866, as already staled.
   My thanks are duo to Messrs. Wilberforce, Whitehead, and
Fitzpatrick for assistance in making the experiments.

§ 242. rpiIERMAL Relation ofsome Aniline Salts to Water.—
              In turning to organic ammonias and their salts
which contain radicals of greater molecular weight, and belong
ing to different series from those we have been considering
above, we are tempted by aniline. It can be got in a state
of great purity. Its salts are well defined and stable, and of
various degrees of solubility. The aniline I employed was
rectified several times, converted into the chloride, and twice
recrystallized; reconverted into the base by caustic potash,
dried, and finally distilled.
   Aniline is slightly soluble in water. On cooling to a tem
perature of — 0°*7, the water and aniline solidify together as
a porcelain-like opaque cryohydrate, which is, however, too
poor in aniline to be capable of satisfactory analysis.
   § 243. Chloride of Aniline.—As a cryogen, the chloride of
aniline gave a temperature of — 10°*5. For its solubility the
weighed solution was evaporated in a water-bath until it
ceased to lose weight. Saturated at 130,1, it was found that
8*3210 grams gave 3-8875 anhydrous salt, or 46*72 per cent.
Saturated at 0 , 13*2836 grams gave 5*3595 grams dry salt, or
40*35 per cent. The solution saturated at 0°, or a 20-per-cent.
solution placed in a freezing-mixture, falls to the temperature of
 — 10°*7. It is here as generally preferable to reach the cryo
hydrate from the dilute side. This cryohydrate readily forms a
supersaturated solution. Of the cryohydrate, 7*1760 grams
gave 2*2860 dry salt, or 31*86 per cent.
   Percentage solutions were then made, and their temperatures
of initial solidification determined.

   § 244. Nitrate of Aniline.—As a cryogen, the temperature
— 2°"2 was obtained. A solution saturated at 13°"1 was eva
porated in vacuo over sulphuric acid until it ceased to lose
weight ; 7*5174 grams gave 1-1710 gram dry salt, or 15-58 per
cent. 8"(>860 grams of solution saturated at 0° gave 0*9500
gram, or 10-94 per cent. A dilute solution reached, in a
freezing-mixture, the constant temperature of — 20,2. Of
this, the cryohydrate, 7*7972 grams gave 0-8270 gram dry
salt, or 10'61 per cent. The nitrate cannot be dried in a
water-bath without suffering partial decomposition. The
above results are embodied in the following table, which also
shows the temperatures of initial solidification.

   § 245. Sulphate of Aniline.—This salt was recrystallized
three times, and after drying between blotting-paper was
finally dried before a brisk open fire. As a cryogen it showed
a temperature of — 0°*8. Of the solution saturated at 13°*1,
it was found that 25*6925 grams gave 1*5000 dry residue, or
5*84 per cent. Of the solution saturated at 0° C, 8*867 ft grams
gave 0*4357 grain, or 4*91 per cent. The solidifying tempe
rature of the cryohydrate was found to be — 0°*9, and 9*5607
grams of it gave 0*4620 gram dry salt, or 4*83 per cent. This
salt appears to melt in its water of crystallization, and takes a
long time to dry. The following table contains the above
results, together with the temperature of initial solidification
in solutions of several strengths. The sparing solubility of
the salt limits the table very much.

 of aniline saturated at 14°*5 gave 0*1080 gram dry salt, or
 1*29 per cent. At 0° I obtained 0 0320 gram of the dry salt
 from 10*8170 grams solution, which means only 0*29 per
 cent. The cryohydrate was formed at the very high tempe
 rature of — 0°*4. On evaporation, 8*5450 grams gave 0 02
 gram dry salt, or only 0*14 per cent. The sparing solubility
 of the salt in water prevented me from examining solutions
 of strengths weaker than the cryohydrate.

    For curve see fig. 2. Although the temperature here
 shown for the cryohydrate is distinctly below zero, proving
 that the oxalate is not, like a colloid, molecularly free from the
 water, yet I am not assured that I have been able to form a
 true cryohydrate in the solid form. The ice and salt separate
 apart, the former adhering to the glass, and the microscopic
 transparent crystals of the latter remaining in suspension in
 the solution. The first analysis, indeed, showed greater per
 centage of salt at — 0O-4 than at 0°, the difference amounting
 to about 0'28 per cent, on the highest. This is an impossible
 result. The state of things clearly arose from the circum
 stance that the liquid cryohydrate was enriched by the sus
 pended crystals. The solution at 0° was also abnormally rich
 from the same cause. It was only on keeping the solution in
ice for twenty-four hours that the zero amount above given
was obtained, and by keeping the zero solution for twelve
hours in a weak freezing-mixture (nitre and ice) that the
cryohydrate (in a liquid form) was got.
    § 247. Salicylate of Aniline* .—The above remarks are again
 applicable to this salt. So sparingly is it soluble in water at
 all temperatures, and so close below 0C is the cryohydrate, that
 no examination of this region was practicable. Of a solution
at 0°, 10-3720 grams gave 0-0295 gram, or 0-28 per cent.
The cryohydrate formed at -0° 05 or -0°'07. Of it, 10 0310
grams gave 0"0245 gram, or 0"24 per cent. A solution satu
rated at 6°"2 gave 0"0710 gram salt out of 10*9270 grams
solution, that is 0-65 per cent. Even at 16°-8 there was only
obtained 0-0800 gram from 10-3450 grams, or 0-77 per cent.

   * The salicylate of aniline has not, I believe, been previously described.
It is obtained by mixing an alcoholic solution of aniline -with the acid.
It fuses at about 150°, and cannot be distilled without decomposition. It
is slightly soluble in bisulphide of carbon ; soluble in ether, hot or cold ;
soluble in alcohol, hot or cold ; soluble in hot benzol, very sparingly in
cold.

    § 248. Pyrogallale of Aniline*.—3-7270 grams of the solu
tion saturated at 17°-8 yielded l-7440gram dry salt in vacuo,
or 46*80 per cent. Of a solution saturated at 0° C, 5-92 grams
 gave 1-992 gram of the dry salt, or 33-65 per cent. As a
 cryogen the temperature — 4°-6 was obtained, and the cryo-
hydrate showed the same temperature. 9-397 of cryohydrate
gave 2-253 of salt, or 23-98 per cent. Tlie above results, and
the separation of solid matter on loss of heat, are exhibited in

    The curve corresponding to these numbers is found in
fig. 2. It is to be noted that amongst all the curves referring
to the aniline salts, that belonging to the nitrate alone has a
well-marked concavity on its ascending branch (from the
cryohydrate to the right) turned towards the axis of strength.
The very important signification of this curvature will form
the key to much in the next Chapter referring to the limit of
solubility, or rather to the unlimited solubility in certain cases
of certain salts, especially nitrates.
   * As I do not find any account of this body, I may briefly note its pre
paration and properties. On mixing the two substances pyrogollic acid
and aniline, a dry hard mass is obtained. As this is soluble in aniline,
only a slight excess of the latter is used. The solid mass is dissolved in a
minimum of hot benzol ; cooled to about 5°, filtered, and washed with cold
benzol. Amongst its properties are the following :—It fuses at 126° C.
or 128° C. It is very soluble in water, hot and cold ; also in hot and cold
alcohol and ether ; soluble in hot benzol, very sparingly in cold ; very
sparingly soluble in bisulphide of carbon, hot or cold. Fused on glass, it
forms a beautiful crystalline film, the crystals being several inches long.
It is anhydrous. In another preparation, 1 part of pyrogallic acid was
dissolved in 4 parts of water at 60°. Aniline was added until a specimen
became cloudy on cooling. It was cooled to about 10° and filtered through
wet paper. It was then evaporated to about half its bulk and dried in
vacuo over sulphuric acid. It turns brown on exposure to the air.

      § 249. An examination of curves of solubility of salts in
   water, drawn so that the ordinates are temperatures and the
   abscissae are percentages, reveals two types of curves, which
   differ only essentially in their right-hand or salt-saturated
   branches. Iodide and bromide and, perhaps, chloride of
   sodium may be taken as the type of a, fig. 3, and nitre of b,
   fig. 3 (see § 126). The curvature of the right-hand branches
   of both curves must diminish as we travel from the cryohy-
   drate in the direction of the arrows, otherwise there would be
   two temperatures at which there is the same solubility (a, fig.
   3, dotted lines) for every solubility between certain limits ;
   or (b, fig. 3, dotted lines) there would be two solubilities for
   every temperature between certain limits. If we concede the

   hyperbolically, or there must be contrariflexure. The first
   would carry the conditions into the region of critical state and
   decomposition. The second might mean, in the case of a
   type, if such asymptote be also parallel to the ordinates, that
   a certain per cent, ratio of salt is soluble in water at a certain
   temperature, and at all higher temperatures; in the case of b
   type, if such asymptote be parallel to the abscissa?, that at
   a certain temperature a finite mass of water will dissolve an
   infinite mass of salt.

   For the experimental examination of this curious question
the salt-alloy of nitrate of lead and nitrate of potash, described
in § 215, is excellently well adapted. Its composition is
4(3-86 nitrate of lead +53*14 nitrate of potash, and itsfusing-
point, being 207°, is well within the range of the mercurial
thermometer. Its constituents at this temperature are far
below their temperature of decomposition, and, what is of
equal importance, both the nitrates are essentially anhydrous
at all temperatures above 0° C.
   § 250. a grams of this sahValloy, finely powdered and
freed from condensed moisture, were introduced into a
weighed tube. A little water being then introduced through a
capillary tube, the end was sealed off, and both reweighed,
the amount of water introduced being thus known. The sealed
tube was wrapped round in two places with copper wire, and
placed in a copper oil-bath. The bath was heated till com
plete fusion was effected, the water and salt completely mixing
to a colourless limpid liquid. The wire enables the tube to be
taken out and the contents moved to and fro.
   When complete fusion is obtained the bath is allowed to
cool slowly, being kept well stirred. The temperature of inci
pient solidification is observed several times, to avoid possible
errors arising from supersaturation, although with this salt-
alloy no such condition appears to obtain. As considerable
pressure may be exerted on the tube, it and the thermometer
were viewed through two sheets of glass six inches apart.
None of the tubes, however have burst.
   The following results were obtained:—
            Percentage of           Solidifying
               Salt.               temperature.

               98-24                   197°
   § 251. These results are striking and important. Tho
phenomenon of fusion per se is continuous with, and nothing
more than an extreme case of, liquefaction by solution. When
we are considering such a case as tho second, near the top,
where 0-18 weight of water dissolve 99-82 of salt, we are in
duced to regard it as a solution of water in the fused salt
rather than the converse, especially as the solidifying-point is
so near that of the dry salt. It will be readily granted that a
proportion of the alloy and water having even less water than
the above will have an incipient solidifying temperature even
closer to the temperature of fusion of the dry alloy. Hence

                         and Attached Water.                     113
  the question, Is this a case of fusion or solution ? is to be
  answered by the reply, It is continuous with both.
     The above results with this salt-alloy gave encouragement
  for the examination of nitre alone with water. The thermal
  relationship of nitre and water from —3° C, the melting-
  point of the cryohydrate, to the boiling-point of a saturated
  solution at one atmospheric pressure, about 115° C, has been
  pretty fully examined by others and myself. The results are
  shown in Table LVI. The first sixteen are from my memoir
  IV., § 129; the next five are on the authority of Gay-Lussac;
  the last seven, which are those to which I wish here to direct
  particular attention, are obtained by the use of sealed tubes
  as described in § 240. The result corresponding to T = 115°
  is interpolated for the sake of verification from Table LVII.
  § 253, where a different method of experimenting was under-
  token for a different purpose. For T = 100° C., the solu
  tion saturated at 114 C. was allowed to cool for several
  hours in a tube surrounded by boiling water (16*05 grams
  gave 11*485 grams nitre). For T = 109° C, the solution
¦ saturated at 114° C. was allowed to cool for several hours in
  a tube surrounded by a boiling saturated solution of chloride
  of sodium (17-83 grams of the solution gave 13*2945 grams
  of nitre).
      § 252. It must not be overlooked that, although the tubes in
  the last seven experiments were filled as full of the nitre as the
  exigencies of manipulation permitted, a certain air-space was
  unavoidably left into which the water in the tube was free to
  evaporate. In the last one, indeed, in which water was present
  its actual weight was only 0*114 gram. This, heated by itself
  in the free space to 300° C.,would have become dry superheated
  steam. But the fact that it lowered the temperature of solidifi
  cation 20° C. shows that in the presence of nitre it is not all
  free. The vapour-tensions of strong solutions of nitre will
  have to be determined. Correlation with this table or with
  Wiillner's results is all the more necessary, because, as
  has been shown by Sorby and others, variation in pressure is
  not without influence on solubility as well as upon fusion,
  per se.

   § 253. Boiling-Points of Solutions of Nitre.—To determine
the boiling-points of solutions of nitre of various strengths,
40 grams, which were in the later experiments made up to
100 grams, were placed in a clean tin vessel having a narrow
neck, together with a thermometer and an indefinite amount of
water. The whole was supported in a hot-air chamber so that
the neck only of the tin vessel projected. An arrangement
was also made for blowing hot air through the upper part of
the vessel. By this arrangement it was hoped that the
amount of water condensed in the vessel above the liquid
would be inconsiderable. The liquid was boiled until a
certain temperature was reached. The vessel was then re
moved, partially cooled, and weighed. This was done at every
half-degree. In the table the temperatures are deduced at
which boiling occurs in strengths rising 5 per cent, from 20
per cent. In column II. the results are smoothed out under
the assumption that there is a rise of 10-211 for every 5 per
cent.

   § 254. When a conception such as the above is once fairly
grasped, numerous exemplary phenomena which have hitherto
been vaguely entertained re-present themselves and claim kin
dred with it. Thus it is well known that the temperatures of
fusion of many organic solids are notably lowered when in
contact with water, or even when imperfectly dried ; and
this is more marked with those whose temperatures of fusion
are not high, and which are nominally classed among insoluble
bodies. Such bodies will, especially when in a state of fine
division, condense water from the air, and hold it with such

                       and Attached Water.                    117
tenacity that they will not relinquish it wholly and imme
diately when heated to or even above 100° C. Again, acetate
of potassium in solution and subjected to heat, shows continuity
of the liquid condition between strong solution and anhydrous
fusion. Further, if nitrate of ammonium bo dried before a
brisk fire, or in vacuo over sulphuric acid, it has no associated
water. But a solution of that salt in water passes, on
evaporation over the flame, from the state of solution to that
of fusion without intermediate solidification. Nay, under such
treatment it may begin to decompose before it has become
anhydrous.      This has, indeed, led some experimeters to
conclude that in the dry crystalline state it contains a mole
cule of water. This has arisen from the two facts—first, that
it is hygroscopic in moist air, and, second, that one of the
products of its decomposition in the dry state is water. The
lowering of the boiling-point of a liquid by admixture with
even a very little of another liquid having even a higher
boiling-point is a phenomenon of the same order.
    § 255. Geological bearing of §§ 249-254.—Just as in the
selective formation of what in my last memoir were described
as salt-alloys we may have the artificial type of the genesis of
many primary rocks and metamorphic modifications, so in the
 wonderful solubility in or miscibility with water of such
alloys and of some salts at high temperatures we may have a
no less clear type of the formation of certain volcanic rocks
and an explanation of some of their peculiarities.           The
function of water in affecting rocks has been subjected to
a most exhaustive examination by Daubreo. Water, in
both its solid and liquid form, is a rock. Under pressure
the limit of temperature is not known to which it may be
heated without decomposition, when in contact with bodies
saturated with oxygen. Granting that water may have a so-
called critical temperature, and range above it when it is
heated with bodies which have no physical relationship to
wards it, still at high pressures it will be compressible as a
vapour to a density at least as great as that of liquid water ;
and until actual decomposition ensues the physical relation
ship of the water-molecule with the rock-molecule will
remain possibly unchanged. It is true that at the very highest
temperatures water appeared to be decomposed ; but this is
only when it is unconfined.
   Whether the earth's temperature be vastly greater towards
its centre than it is near the surface, or whether the observed
increase with depth be confined to a mere skin of the earth,
there seems to be no reason to suppose that water may not,
and does not, exist at the earth's very centre.

 118           Frederick Guthrie on Salt-Solutions
    If the earth were a sphere of liquid having a density of 5,
 the pressure at its centre would be over three million atmo
 spheres—a pressure competent, to preserve the density of
 water at a temperature sufficient to fuse perhaps the most
 refractory known rocks. But at this high temperature the
 water would, judging by analogy, mix freely with the rock
 and relieve itself—one cannot yet say how much (compare,
 however, my next memoir, IX.), but certainly very greatly
 from its tension.
    That there are true sedimentary formations of course no
 one can deny ; but to attribute to marine influence the
 formation of rocks because water is found within them, or
 because water is liberated when melted rock-masses are
 ejected, is a contention no longer supportable. Obsidian
melted and under pressure will, I presume, mix freel}' with
water. When this pressure is gradually removed, water-
vapour escapes, and although it takes with it a large amount of
heat, the temperature of the obsidian may still remain above
its point of anhydrous fusion, or it may be maintained fused
by heat from other sources. Finally cooled, it is the familiar
glassy amorphous mineral. A quick release of pressure
entails a quick vaporization of water and a quick loss of heat.
The obsidian mass, during and because of the loss of water
and the loss of heat, becomes pasty and " rises " like dough
during fermentation, and becomes pumice, which is often
found overlying obsidian. A quicker release of pressure
from above causes the vesicular and vesiculating masses to be
projected, and if the vesiculation is carried far and fast
volcanic dust is produced. That water is one of the ac
companiments of volcanic activity is well known.             The
presence of hydrochloric acid in the ejecta, and the almost
universal neighbourhood of the sea to active volcanoes, has
favoured the view that the material for the motive power is
supplied by the marine irruption. Without entering upon
the question as to whether sea-water is essential to volcanoes,
and whether hydrochloric acid is a product of the action of
acid silicates or silicic acid upon the chlorides in that liquid,
I contend that the evidence is conclusive that at one period
the melting masses contain water. They are in the same
predicament as the nitre liquified along with water at a high
temperature and under corresponding great pressure.
   This subject has been so fully discussed by Daubr^e in his
various memoirs, and is so ably treated in his Gdologie
Expirimentale, that, as far as their geological bearing is
concerned, my experiments may be considered as merely
adding another chapter to his work.

                       and Attached Water.                  119
   Graham has shown how alumina, silica, oxide of tin, and
oxide of iron may be obtained in aqueous solution in the
colloidal state : and Daubree has proved that at high tem
perature and under pressure water disintegrates and decom
poses certain rocks, and rearranges their constituents, and
has argued that, assisted by capillarity and high temperature,
many phenomena of volcanism and metamorphism are to be
attributed to that agent. He has thus vastly extended the
scope of the long-known action of water on silicates, and
showed that under conditions of temperature water alone
plays as potent a part in such disintegration as the fixed
alkalies were known to do under like conditions. My experi
ments may perhaps be considered as leading us a step further.
For they show that water at a high temperature may not
only play the part of a solvent in the ordinary restricted
sense, but that there is in many cases no limit to its solvent
faculty ; in other words, that it may be miscible with certain
rocks in all proportions : that solution and mixture are con
tinuous with one another. And this continuity, as my experi
ments prove, is established in some cases,—and these indeed
with bodies having no chemical affinity with water,—at tem
peratures not above the temperatures of fusion of those bodies
per se. This induces me to think that the replenishment of
water in rocks by capillarity, an action upon which Daubree
lays great stress and with regard to which he adduces many
striking experiments, is not an essential condition. I must,
however, leave the discussion of this question to penologists.
   [Note added June 1G, 1884.—Since the above was in print
I have been favoured with a copy of a most interesting
memoir by Prof. Tilden and Mr. W. A. Shenstone on the
" Solubility of Salts in Water at High Temperatures," read
before the Royal Society of London, June 21, 1883 (Transac
tions of the Royal Society, Part I. 1884). Accordingly,
wherever in the two memoirs there may be found similarity
in results or ideas, the priority is theirs.
   These gentlemen have apparently been to a considerable
extent guided by the conception that there is a relationship
between the solubility of a salt in water and its temperature
of fusion. And perhaps their main argument concerns this
relationship. They have made a special study of those inter
esting cases in which the solid salt contains water of crystal
lization. This branch of the inquiry I have rather deliberately
avoided, as I wished to establish the analogy between metallic
and dry-salt alloyage, on the one hand, and water-salt alloyage
on the other. Nevertheless they examined the solubility of

120           Messrs. Turpin and Warrington on the
nitre in water at 125°. Their experiments on solubility appear
to stop short far below the temperature of fusion of the salt
per se (excepting in cases where the salt contains water of
crystallization). They distinctly state, however, that infinite
solubility is " nearly true of benzoic acid, which melts at
120°             By sealing it up with water in a glass tube and
heating to a few degrees beyond the melting-point, intermix
ture occurs in all proportions ; and the liquid so obtained, on
cooling to 120°, or about 1° lower, becomes turbid from depo
 sition of oily drops, which, however, immediately crystallize."

 XITI. On the Apparent Viscosity of Ice. By G. S. Turpin and
     A. W. Warrington, B.Sc, Students in the Owens College,
     Manchester* .
  SOME years ago Mr. J. T. Bottomleyf devised an experi
        ment to illustrate the effect of pressure on a melting
 block of ice. A stout copper wire with heavy weights attached
  at its two ends is slung across a block of ice which is sup
  ported in any convenient manner. The wire gradually makes
  its way through the block ; but the ice constantly re-forms
  behind the wire, so that after the block has been cut right
  through it is still whole and entire. The path travelled over
  by the wire does not, however, possess its original structure,
  but is now semi-transparent, and the block splits readily along
  this path.
      Bottomley found that string, under the same circumstances
  as tho copper wire, would not cut through ice. The explana
  tion he gives is that " the string is not a good enough con
  ductor to relieve itself of the cold in front and pass it back to
  the water behind." In this shape the explanation does not
   seem very clear, but in the following expanded form it is
   evident enough. When the wire shirts its journey, its upper
   surface is in contact with ice-cold water, and its lower surface
   in contact with ice. The pressure of the wire tends to make
   the ice beneath it melt ; but before this can occur the latent
   heat of liquefaction must be supplied, and in the case of the
   copper wire is readily obtained from the water above, which
   is in consequence frozen. The newly formed water is forced
   upwards round the wire; and the same process is repeated
   until the wire has made its way through the block. When,
                    <U+2666> Communicated by the Authors,
                    t 'Nature,' vol. v. 1872, p. 185.

                      Apparent Viscosity of Ice.                121
however, string is used instead of copper wire, this conduction
of heat does not readily occur.
    In repeating this experiment, water could be distinctly
seen moving quickly round the sides of the wire from its under
to its upper surface ; and in one particular case, when a brass
wire one tenth of an inch in diameter was used with two
weights of 56 lb. each, crystals of ice were seen actually
growing in the water on the upper surface of the wire, just
before it became completely buried in the ice.
    In order to determine the effect of conductivity an experi
ment was made with five different wires. As a matter of
 convenience, each wire was placed on a separate block of ice,
 but the blocks were sawn to as nearly as possible the same
 size. The times taken by the different wires in cutting through
 the blocks were:—
                  Wire.       Time, in minutes.  Conductivity.
            Silver                   192              100

                                     300               11-9
            German-silver ...        314                 63
      Each wire was "67 millim. diameter, and carried 2£ lb.
  The numbers obtained show that the time taken increases as
  the conductivity decreases; but there is an apparent exception
  in the case of the silver and copper wires. To find whether
  this was due to any difference in the blocks of ice, they were
  interchanged, with the following result: —
                   Wire.       Time, in minutes.  Conductivity.
                                      103              100
                                      110               73-6
      In this case the silver has the advantage ; and the difference
   in the times, in proportion to the total time taken, is greater
   than before.
      Another experiment was made with the same two wires on
   one block, each wire being weighted with 20 lb. Results :—

122              On the Apparent Viscosity of Ice.
              Wire.        Time, in minutes.   Conductivity.

                                  15*                73-6
   The difference is here one eighth of the whole time, and is
again in favour of the silver wire.
   These results prove that the time increases as the conduc
tivity decreases ; but we have been unable to find any simple
relation connecting them together.
   Another experiment was made to determine the influence
of the weight used. Three pieces of iron wire, cut from the
same sample, were loaded with different weights and placed
across a block of ice. The times taken in cutting through
were as follows:—
              Load.        Time, in minutes.   Load X Time.
              51b.               225               1125
              7i lb.             140$              1099
             12J lb-              84               1090
   The numbers in the third column show that the time taken
is approximately inversely proportional to the load.
   Amongst the experiments made by Pfaff* to prove the
plasticity of ice is the following one :—An iron tube placed
upright on a block of ice is completely surrounded with snow
to prevent its temperature rising above 0° C, and a pressure
of about two atmospheres is applied at its upper end by means
of a one-armed lever : the tube slowly forced its way into the
ice, and after an hour had sunk 3 centim. At the close of the
experiment Pfaff found inside the iron tube a cylinder of ice,
which fitted so closely that it would not fall out by its own
weight. From this Pfaff concludes that the sinking of the
iron tube is due almost entirely to the plasticity of ice, and
only minutely, if at all, to the effect of pressure in lowering
the freezing-point of water.
   It is, however, at once evident that the explanation given
of Bottomlcy's experiment also applies to this; the only differ
ence being that, whereas in the former case the heat necessary
for the liquefaction of the ice under presure is obtained from
                     • Pogg. Ann. civ. p. 169 (187fi).

the water above the wire, in this it is obtained from the water
which is about the sides of the tube. The existence of the
tightly fitting cylinder of ice inside the tube, so far from being
an objection to this explanation, is a necessary consequence
of it.
    In order to confirm this explanation, Pfaff's experiment
was repeated with four pieces of tubing—of glass, copper,
brass, and lead, each about 1 foot long and $ inch bore. The
distances to which the tubes penetrated in four hours are
contained in the following table:—
                lube.           Loud.         Distance.
                                21b.         100 millim.

                                2J„            3    „
    The glass tube was loaded with an extra half-pound in order
to make up for its smaller weight.
    This shows conclusively that when the experiment is made
at a temperature not lower than 0° C, the chief factor is the
lowering of the freezing-point by pressure, and not the plas
ticity of ice. But in the same paper Pfaff describes experi
ments conducted at temperatures below zero in which the iron
 tube still penetrated into the ice, though to a very much
 smaller distance than before. Thus, at a temperature varying
 from —4° to —1°, the same tube which at 0° sank 30 millim.
 in one hour, sank only li millim. in twelve hours. In this case
 the experiment seems capable of explanation only by admitting
 the presence of a certain degree of plasticity in ice, which is
 rendered very probable by other experiments described by
 Pfaff", where a sheet of ice bends gradually under its own
 weight.
 XIV. On the Thermal Relationship between Water and certain
         Salts. By B. Illdngwobth and A. Howard*.
 THE study of the relationship towards water of certain
       organic salts belonging to one and the same series promised
 to throw light upon the general question of the relationship
 between salts and water, inasmuch as the degree of difference
 between the members compared may be made at will very
     • Communicated by the Physical Society. Read June 14, 1884.

124     Messrs. Illingworth and Howard on the Thermal
considerable ; while the kind of difference is not to be com
pared with that resulting from the substitution of an acid or
basic element in a given salt.
    We have accordingly submitted to examination the sul-
phomethylate, the sulphoethvlate, and the sulphoamylate of
potassium (K,OH3S04; K,CaH5S04; and K, C5 Hu S04) ;
and we venture to think that the results are of sufficient
interest for us to give the following brief account of them.
    We satisfied ourselves that the substances were nearly pure.
The methyl salt contained, however, a trace of chlorine, and
the amyl salt was not quite free from the same impurity.
They were finely powdered, and dried over sulphuric acid in
partial vacuum until they ceased to lose weight. A thermo
meter, the error of which at 0° was determined, and which
was graduated to tenths of a degree (each tenth being -j80-
millim. long), enabled us to read temperatures with consider
able precision.
    Sulphoethylate of Potassium (K, C2 H5 S04).—Starting with
the ethyl salt, a preliminary examination, made by mixing the
 salt with about twice its weight of finely crushed ice, showed
the cryogeu value to be — 1 3 *9 C. This, according to analog}-,
should be the melting- and solidifying-temperature of the
cryohydrate. Solutions containing various percentages of
the anhydrous salt were made and submitted to a salt- ice
 cryogen, the temperature being noted at which solidification
 began.
    With regard to the solubility at the air-temperature :—A
solution saturated at 21° C. was allowed to cool for several
 hours until it reached 15°"1 C. Of this solution, 7*3342
 grams were weighed in a covered basin and then dried in
vacuo over sulphuric acid. The nearly dry mass was powdered
 and redried until it ceased to lose weight. 4*5732 grains,
 or 62'35 per cent., were thus obtained.
    A solution saturated at the air-temperature was fairly buried
 in melting ice for several hours and until its temperature had
 remained for a few hours at 0° C. Examined as above,
 24*0880 grams gave 12*9375 grams of anhydrous salt, or
 53*71 per cent.
    A solution of strength between 40 and 50 per cent, was
 cooled in an ice-salt cryogen until its temperature remained
constant at — 14°*2 C. After a considerable amount had
solidified, 11*9813 grams of the solution were dried, and
yielded 5*3932 grams dry salt, or 45*01 per cent. It will be
 noted that the temperature of the cryogen of this salt was
 found to be —13°*!', or 0°*3 higher than the melting-point of
 the cryohydrate.

        The ethyl and methyl combinations run an almost common
     course as far as the cryohydrate of the latter. They cross at
     about 24 per cent. The cryohydrate of the ethyl salt contains
     about 5 per cent, more salt and melts at 2°-4 lower. The
     ascending or salt branches of the curves are almost absolutely
     parallel, but exhibiting a slightly opposite curvature.

   Perhaps the most salient fact concerning this group is that
the methyl compound is intermediate in these of its physical
properties between the ethyl and the amyl members. So
interesting did this relationship appear, that we have deter
mined the specific gravities of the three salts. Turpentine
was used as the liquid displaced. The dry salt having been
weighed in the specific-gravity bottle, a little turpentine was
added and the air exhausted. The bottle was subsequently
filled with turpentine in the usual way. The air-temperature
was 19°"6, and the specific gravity of the turpentine compared
with water at the same temperature was 0'86838. It was
found that
           fsp. grav. of sulphomethylate of potassium = 2097,
at 19°*6-i     „ „ sulphoethylate of potassium = l-843,
           [ „       „ sulphoamylate of potassium =1*144.
    Accordingly the densities of the salts are in the inverse
order of their molecular weights, and the ethyl compound is
in this respect in its usual place between the amyl and methyl
relatives.

    XV. Hemihedrism of Cuprite. By H. A. Miers, M.A ,
       Assistant in the Mineral Department, British Museum*.
                               [Plate VI.]
A LOOSE crystal of cuprite (about 4 millim. across),
         found among a large number of mineral specimens
 which had been collected by the late Mr. Richard Tailing,
and which were offered to the British Museum for purchase,
was noticed by Mr. Thos. Davies as hemihedral in form.
    Subsequently about twelve specimens were found, all from
Wheal Phoenix, Cornwall, belonging partly to the same col
lection and partly to the collection in the Museum, which are
characterized by the same peculiarity. This hemihedral de
velopment I have been requested by Mr. Fletcher to describe.
    It proves to be a mode of hemihedrism of great interest
to the crvstallographer as one which for more than sixty
years has been regarded as theoretically possible, but which
has not been hitherto observed on any mineral, and has only
recently been proved to exist on artificial sal-ammoniac.
    The usual form of the crystals is shown in fig. 4, where a
are the cube, o the octahedron, and x the new hemihedral
                      • Communicated by the Author.

128                   Mr. H. A. Miers on the
faces. They vary from the habit of fig. 4, in which the cube
predominates, to the similar combination of octahedral habit
in which the cube-faces are comparatively small, crystals of
cubic habit being most common. The dodecahedron-faces d
often enter into the combination, as is shown in fig. 5, which
represents a third distinct habit characterized by the pre
dominance of the hemihedral form x. The only other form
observed on these crystals is {2 1 1}. The cube, octahedron,
and dodecahedron planes are bright and even, while the faces
x are bright, but slightly rounded and uneven ; they are
roughly striated parallel to their intersections with the octa
hedron, and sometimes parallel to the most remote of the three
nearest cube-faces.
   The angles, measured and calculated, are as follows :—

   The best measurements obtained for a single face x to the
three cube-faces were 47° 5W, 53° 20', (54° 4'.
   The position of the faces x in the figures shows that they
afford an example of the hemihedrism which has been described
in the text-books of Crystallography * from the time of Mohs
as trapezohedral or gyroidal, and as a theoretically possible
though hitherto unobserved mode of hemihedrism in the
Cubic System. Within the last three years, however, it has
been discovered as occurring on one, and has been suggested
for another, artificial salt.
   If alternate faces of the complete 48-faced figure be sup
pressed, two half-forms are obtained for which the cubic and
dodecahedral planes are no longer planes of symmetry. It
was made clear by Mohs f that these two hall-forms are
enantiomorphous, and may therefore be distinguished as right

and left. With the notation of Miller they may be denoted
respectively by a{k h 1} and a'h k 1}.
   The faces x are therefore to be assigned to the half-form
a {9 8 6}, though, as may be seen from the limits of variation
in the above table, the numerical values of the indices cannot
be assigned with absolute precision.
   Fig. 1 represents the complete form {9 8 6}.
   Fig. 2 represents the half-form a{9 8 6l, obtained by reject
ing the shaded faces, and is the half-form peculiar to cuprite.
This is Mohs' left pentagon-icositetrahedron.
    Fig. 3 represents the half-form a{8 9 6}, obtained by
retaining the shaded faces; this is Mohs' right pentagon-
icositetrahedron .
   It may be noticed that this mode of hemihedrism only
affects the form of the 48-faced figure {h k 1} ; so that in the
case of cuprite, in which such faces are very rare, it is not
surprising that the hemihedral character has hitherto escaped
attention. Hexakis-octahedron faces have been figured as
occurring holohedrally by W. Phillips *, and Kokscharow t,
but in neither case have indices been ascribed to the faces.
   Where such forms have been noticed upon specimens in
the Museum, they are so uneven and irregular that neither their
position nor their number can be satisfactorily determined.
   The cases in which this trapezohedral hemihedrism has
been already recorded are the following :—
    (1) TschermakJ observed small faces of o{7 8 5} on
artificial crystals of sal-ammoniac, upon edges of the form
p={211}.
            Observed.                            Calculated.
                                      f> = (785)             p = (896)
      p:(121)=13 10                = 13 197                =13 49-3
      p:(211) = 21                 = 20 13-8               =19 49-8
    It is thus possible that the hemihedral faces of sal-ammoniac
and of cuprite may belong to the same form ; but it is remark
able that the crystals of sal-ammoniac exhibit the right,
and those of cuprite the left half-form.

artificial crystals of mixed potassium and sodium chlorides
 faces which were obliquely striated in such a way as to

    Lastly, it has been a question of interest whether this mode

  of hemihedrism, if observed, would be accompanied by circular
  folarization *. Tbe crystals of sal-ammoniac did not show it.
   n the case of cuprite, although many crystals transmit
  light in irregular patches between crossed Nicols, there is no
  evidence of circular polarization.
       Note.—The cleavage of cuprite is stated in the text-books to
  be octahedral. The specimens examined on the present occasion
• show, in addition to the uneven and interrupted octahedral
  cleavage, a bright and perfect cleavage parallel to the faces

  XVI. On the Colour of Chemical Compounds, chiefly as a
       Function of the Atomic Weights oftheir Constituent Elements.
       —Parti. Inorganic Compounds. By Thomas Oarnklley,
       D.Sc. (London), Professor of Chemistry in University
        College, Dundee^.
  THERE are at least three circumstances which condition
            the colour of chemical compounds, viz.:—
        1. Temperature.
       2. The quantity of the electro-negative element present, in
  a binary compound.
       3. The atomic weights of the constituent elements of the
  compound.
        Of these, the first two, together with a few other points in
  this connexion, have been studied in some detail by JJe]aval|,
  Talbot §, Brewster ||, Schonbeinlf, Gladstone**, Houston tt>
  Ackroydjf, Petrie§§, Ross||||, and Bayloyllf. Though it is
  to the third of these circumstances that I wish more particu
  larly to direct attention in the present communication, yet it

                      of Chemical Compounds.                     131
will be well to state briefly the more important results which
have been obtained by other investigators in regard to the
first and second.
   I. Influence of Temperature.—As to the influence of tem
perature on the colour of chemical compounds, it appears, as
shown more particularly by Mr. Ackroyd, that many bodies
when heated undergo alterations in colour ; these alterations
being such that, as the temperature rises, the colour passes
through the following chromatic scale:—
                     White or Colourless.
                     Violet.
                     Indigo.
                     Blue.
                     Green.                      ¦Cooling
      Heating.
                     Yellow.
                     Orange.
                     Bed.
                     Brown.
                     Black.
In other words, nearly all chromatic changes take place in a
definite order, viz. the order of the spectrum colours, in such
a way that, as the temperature rises, the colour passes more
and more towards the red end of the spectrum ; and subse
quently, if the temperature be high enough, to brown and
black. Most commonly the colour passes directly from white
to pale yellow, the violet, indigo, blue, and green stages being
omitted. As examples we may take the following: —
                    iNWal colour.            Colour assumed as the
                                               temperature rises.
ZnO            white                      yellow and then orange.
Hgl2, 1()°C. red                          dark red.
  „ 140° C. yellow (in sealed tube) orange and then red.
PbO            yellow                     orange and then red.
                                        ' orange-yellow and then
Til            vellow                        orange-red.
                                          green and then greenish-
Cu(BOs)s       blue                         yellow,
                                          brick-red and then black-
PbCr04         orange                       red.
                                          orange, then red, and
Agl            yellowish-white              finally dark red.
                                          orange, then red, and
HgO            orange-yellow                finally brown.
   II. Influence of the Quantity of the Electronegative Element
in Binary Compounds.—It has been pointed out by Ackroyd
and by Petrie that, in the case of binary compounds, an
                               K2

132             Prof. T. Carnelley on the Colour
increase in the quantity of the electronegative element pro
duces a colour-change towards the red end of the spectrum,
in accordance with the above chromatic scale, for example:—
        Bi2 03, yellow.           Bi2 05, brown.
        Sb2 03, white.            Sb205, yellow.
        Gr, Cl«, white,           Cr2 Cl6, violet.
        PtCl„ olive,              PtCl4, orange.
        Cu2 0, red.               CuO, black.
        NiO,     green,           Ni2 03, black.
        Au2 0, green,             Au2 03, brown.
        Hgl, green,               Hgl2, red.
        Crs03, green,             Cr03, red.
        FeO, yellowish,           Fe2 03, red.
        PbO, yellow.              Pb304, red; Pb02, brown.
        MnO, green.             ( Mn304, red-brown; Mn203,
                               \ brown-black; Mn02, black.
   We have also a well-known case of this in the colour-
changes which the green colouring-matter of plants undergoes
during autumn ; this green colouring-matter, as oxidation
proceeds, passing through the colours green, yellow, orange,
brown, dark brown.
   III. Influence of Atomic Weight.—The influence of atomic
weight on the colour of compounds may be stated thus :— In
any series of compounds Ax Ry, B* Ry, Gx R„ &c, in which R
is any element or group of elements, whilst A, B, C, &c. are
elements belonging to the same subgroup of Mcndeljeff's
Table of the Natural Classification of the Elements, given
below, the colour passes either wholly or partially through the
series:—                              White or Colourless.
                                     Violet.
                                      Indigo.
                                     Blue.
    With increase of the              Green.
      Atomic Weight of the           Yellow.
      elements A, B, C, &c.           Orange.
                                      Red.
                                      Brown.
                                      Black.
 Or, in other words, as the atomic weight of the elements A
B, C, &c. increases, the more does the colour of the compound
pass towards the red end of the spectrum, and thence (in
many cases) to brown and black.
   The following Table of the Classification is given for com
parison, elements belonging to even series being printed in
ordinary type and those belonging to odd series in thick type.

       It must be remarked that the above rule applies only to
    those cases in which A, B, 0, &c. are elements belonging to
    the same subgroup, as:—CI, Br, and I ; Na, Cu, Ag, and Au ;
    Mg, Zn, Cd, and Hg ; Be, Ca, Sr, and Ba ; Al, Ga, In, and
    Tl ; 0, Cr, Mo, W, and U ; P, As, Sb, and Bi; &c. ; but not
    in those cases in which they belong to different subgroups.
    Thus oxides cannot strictly be compared with the corresponding
    sulphides, selenides, and tollurides, nor fluorides with the cor
    responding chlorides, bromides, and iodides, &c. ; for F and
    0 are elements belonging to even series, whereas CI, Br, I,
    and S, Se, Te belong to odd series.

     In the above tables, elements belonging to even series are
 printed in ordinary type, and those belonging to odd series in
 thick type, so that it may be seen at a glance which compounds
 are comparable with one another. The arrows also show the
 direction and the extent to which these comparisons may be
 made.
    I have collected in the tables all the available data. The
 colour attached to each compound is that given in the ordinary
text-books, in Watts's Dictionary, and in Gmelin's Handbook.
 In cases where two different authorities do not agree, I have
either given both or have taken the colour of the actual speci
men in our college museum. Some compounds, such as Hgls,
HgO, HgS, Sb2 S3, &c, exist in two differently coloured allo-
tropic modifications*, in which case both colours are entered.
In some few instances also there is given in addition to the
colour (c) when cold, the next colour (/<) which the compound
assumes on heating, and sometimes the subsequent colour
(A h) which it assumes when still more strongly heated.
    It should not be forgotten that the rule formulated above
strictly applies only to compounds in the solid state, and,
further, that even in the solid state the colour is liable to vary
somewhat with the state of aggregation. In general the
colours given in the tables refer to the powdered or precipi
tated condition.
    From the tables it will be seen that out of 426 cases^in
which the rule may be applied there are but 14 exceptions,
viz. : Au20, CdO, TiBr4, PBr5, OCl2, WC14, CrOsCl2, DiCl3,
V205, Cr03, WI„ UC1„ UC14, and Aul3. Of these, two,
viz. OCl2 and Cr02 Cl2, may be omitted, as the colours given
are those of the liquid compounds, whereas the rule, as stated
above, is only considered to be applicable to the solid state.
According to the rule TiBr4 and PBr5 should be white, whereas
these compounds are generally stated to bo pale yellow : it is
possible that the pure compounds are really white or colourless,
   * Depending no doubt on a difference in the size of the molecule, and
in such a way that the modification with a colour nearest the red end of
the spectrum will have the largest molecular weight.

and that the pale yellow colour usually ascribed to them is
due to the presence of a trace of free bromine or other impurity.
    Of the remaining ten exceptions, six (viz. Aus 0, WC1<,
WI2, UC18, UC14, and Aul3) are green instead of being brown
or black, and even these will be in accordance with the rule
if we accept the modified theoretical explanation given under
{It), {vide infra). There remain, therefore, only four excep
tions (viz. DiCl3, V2 06, Cr03, and CdO) which do not admit
of any satisfactory explanation ; and even of these CdO is not
altogether decisive either one way or another, for though it is
brown when in the amorphous state whereas HgO is orange-
yellow, yet CdO and HgO are both red when crystalline.
    Theoretical Explanation.—For the following theoretical
explanation of the phenomena mentioned above, I am chiefly
indebted to my friend and colleague Mr. J. W. Capstick, B.Sc.
    1. Influence of Atomic Weight.—(a) In a solid the molecules
vibrate as wholes about certain mean positions. Other things
being the same {e.g. temperature, &c.) the period of vibration
will be less as the mass of the molecule is less. Tf the time of
vibration of the molecule is so small as to coincide with some
vibration outside the violet end of the spectrum, no visible
vibration will be absorbed and the colour of the substance
will be white. This state of things must hold until (from
chemical substitutions &c.) the mass of the molecule becomes
so great as to bring the period of vibration up to the violet
end, when the violet rays will begin to be absorbed and the
salt will appear of the complementary colour of violet, i. e.
greenish yellow. If the mass of the molecule be made still
greater its period of vibration further increases, and the blue
rays begin to be absorbed, and the light left unabsorbed com
bines to give yellow. Next the green rays are absorbed, and
the result is orange. Then the yellow is cut out in addition,
leaving only red ; and, finally, the red also is cut out, and the
substance becomes black.
   (6) From the colours observed it would appear to be an
almost general rule that when the period of vibration becomes
great enough to cut out a given colour, it also cuts out all
those with smaller wave-length, e.g. when yellow is cut out
the blue and green are also cut out, otherwise the colours
would go from orange to reddish-purple, and then, when the
red is cut out (if the blue, green, and yellow were not also cut
out), the colour would bo greenish instead of the usual black.
The green colour of Au20, WC14, WI„ UC15, UC14, and Aul3
may possibly be accounted for in this way.
   2. Influence of Temperature.—In the case of a solid the
molecules vibrate about certain mean positions, and a rise of

140         On the Colour of Chemical Compounds.
temperature means a greater amplitude of vibration, but not
a greater period. In fact, if the vibration be not quite harmonic
a greater amplitude may, as in the pendulum, require a longer
period. In addition to this a riso of temperature weakens
the cohesion between the molecules, and hence lessons the
force of restitution, thus causing the molecule to vibrate more
slowly, and consequently producing the same changes of
colour as are observed when the mass of the molecule is
increased. (For Ackroyd's explanation of the colour-changes
produced by heat see ' Chemical News/ xxxiv. p. 7(J.)
   The above theory appears to account fully for the otherwise
paradoxical fact, that either increase in molecular weight or
increase in temperature produces identicall}' the same series
of colour-changes.
   The phenomenon referred to under II. (viz., that in any
binary compound an increase in the quantity of the electro
negative element produces a colour-change towards the red
end of the spectrum) is probably due to the increase in the
molecular weight caused by the greater quantity of the
electro-negative element which the compound contains, and is
hence also fully accounted for by the above theory ; thoiigh,
for this explanation to hold good throughout, it would be
necessary in some cases, as in those of the oxides of Cu, Pb,
and Cr, to double or treble the generally received formula of
some of theso oxides, thus :—
   CujO (red), Cu2 02 (black) ; Pb3 03 (yellow), Pb3 04 (red),
Pb3 08 (brown) ; Cr3 03 (green), Cr2 06 (red).
   Finally, there is also somo indication of the colour of com
pounds being a periodic function of the atomic weight. This
is best seen in the case of the normal iodides. If a curve be
constructed in which the ordinates represent the atomic
weights of the positive element, and the abscissae a chromatic
scale rising from black through brown, red, orange, yellow,
green, &c, to white, then the curve so obtained will be of a
nature similar to Lothar Meyer's well-known curve of the
elements.
   In a subsequent paper I hope to apply the above facts to
the colours of organic compounds, whereby I believe it will
be possible to trace a connexion between the composition and
the colour of many dye-stuffs.

    XVII. Preliminary Notice of a new Sunshine-Recorder.
                     By Herbekt M'Leod*.
BEING somewhat doubtful of the accuracy of the pub
       lished reports of the duration of sunshine, in the
slimmer of 1880 I tried to devise some apparatus by which
the light, instead of the heat of the sun, would be used to
produce the record of sunshine. Several trials were made;
and in some of them clockwork was employed to move strips
of sensitive paper. The simplest form of apparatus I have
recently tried again, using the ferroprussiate paper now much
employed by engineers for copying tracings, and which is
preferable to silver paper, first, in consequence of its
cheapness, and, secondly, because of the case with which the
image is fixed, as for this purpose washing in water is
sufficient.
   The apparatus consists of a camera so fixed that its axis
is parallel to the polar axis of the earth, the lens pointing
northwards. Opposite the lens a silvered sphere is placed.
 The rays from the sun are reflected from the sphere through
 the lens of the camera on to the sensitive paper, on which a
 distorted image of the sun is formed ; and the positions of the
 lens and sphere are so arranged that the image is a linear one
 and radial. By the motion of the earth the image is carried
 round in a circular arc, tracing a curve on the sensitive
 paper. In the instrument at present constructed, the sphere
 is a chemical round-bottomed flask silvered inside, and about
 95 millim. in diameter ; the distance from flask to lens is
76 millim., and from lens to sensitive paper 152 millim. ; the
 lens has a focal length of 90 millim. and an effective
 aperture of 22 millim.
    The circle traced by the sun in June is about 120 millim.
 in diameter. An impression is made on the paper by exposure
 for only 10 seconds ; and when the lens is covered for one
 minute, a light line is produced in the circular band, so that
 the paper is sufficiently sensitive in the present apparatus to
 register short gleams of sunshine, and also the passage of
 small clouds. When the sun is shining through light clouds,
 an impression is produced on the paper, but somewhat
 blurred, and of a much less intense blue colour than is
 obtained by bright sunshine. The time-scale is made by
 drawing from the centre of the circular band radial lines,
 containing between them angles of 15°, each of which
 represents one hour of time.

     It still remains to be found which are the most convenient
  dimensions for the globe and lens, so that the minimum of
  alteration of position will be requisite to obtain a sharp
  image during all times of the year ; and also the best method
 of fixing the paper so that it may be easily changed and the
  time-scale marked on it.
                  XVIII. Permanent Magnets.— I.
      By R. H. M. Bosanquet, St. John's College, Oxford.
    To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
 IN somo notes on this subject (Phil. Mag. xv. pp. 205, 257,
       309 ) I showed that, when a permanent magnet is divided
 into short lengths, its total moment is considerably diminished.
 I also endeavoured to treat the theory of the question from
 what I take to be Faraday's point of view. The measures
 then executed were only of one element—the moment. The
 view of the phenomena was therefore insufficient. Having
 now in my hands processes for determining the magnetic
 induction in the magnet, I have made determinations of this
 element, as well as of the moment, in three compound magnets.
 Further, I have measured in one magnet the number of
 ampere-turns of a uniformly wound coil necessary to reduce
 the external action temporarily to zero. These measures
 form the first part of this communication. I find that the
properties of magnets, between the state of thin disks and bars
of about five times the length of their diameter, are governed
by extremely simple laws. Yet these are of such a nature
that I am unable to imagine how the vague generalities
about induction, which some consider sufficient to account for
the facts I have previously brought forward, can be applied
to them with any useful result.
    I then show how the theory I have based on Faraday's
views offers an account of the phenomena, and especially of
the cases comprised within the above limits.
    The complete determination of the functions involved in the
case of bars of greater length will require additional expe
riments.

    The total moment has a finite but small limit ( = 150), when
the bar is supposed to be divided into an infinite number of
thin disks. As to the persistence of the linear laws in the case
of actual disks of small thickness, see bars B and C post.
The moment increases with increments proportional to those

were true and applicable ; in bars the distance of the foci is usually a
little less than that of the poles as ordinarily defined. In the present
paper the foci are made use of as indicating by their position the distri
bution of the magnetism. They may be also regarded, with reserve, as
the points of application of the resultants of the lines of force.

   The moments were measured in the bifilar and the torsion-
balance. They were originally measured in the bifilar with
all the pieces in one tray in each state of combination. The
discrepancy then found between the limiting moment and the
moment of the current-turns required for temporary demag
netization (see post.), gave rise to the suspicion that the induc
tion between the pieces dispersed about the tray was not
negligible. The measures were then repeated, the smaller
combinations being taken three together. The numbers thus
obtained are those above given. The accordance with the
temporary demagnetizing force being still imperfect, though

                          Permanent Magnets.                   145
much improved, a set was made with each piece separately.
The moments had all fallen, but in proportion ; so that there
was no evidence of induction interfering in the values which
are given.
   The constant of the bifilar was determined by vibrating a
leaden rectangle having the same weight as. the tray and
magnet, and a known moment of inertia. The same suspen
sion-stirrup was used in both cases ; its moment of inertia
was determined separately. An approximate value of H was
employed.
   The constant of the torsion-balance was determined by
vibrating a lead rectangle. The variation of the torsion with
the weight was inconsiderable in amount with the wire now
employed, but was somewhat irregular. It is very difficult to
get wire at all suitable for this purpose. Besides the variation
of the constant of torsion, most wires take sets in loading and
unloading to such an extent as to make them nearly useless.
The best wire I have had is excessively hard. By dint of
great labour reliable readings were obtained.
   The first numbers given for 33, and the figure*, represent
the results of experiment. Rowland's method was employed;
ten induction-coils for w=18, 9, 6, 3, 2, and fifteen for the
singles. It is clear, however, and was so from a preliminary
set, that these results need correction. For, according to the
course of the numbers, the induction would vanish, and then
become negative for finite lengths, which is inconceivable.
   The source of the error is doubtless in the fact that, with
short lengths, the coils cannot bo sufficiently concentrated
about the equatorial sections. The coils, though bound up
closely, extend over a considerable part of the length of the
short bars. I have found by direct experiment that spreading
the induction-coils leads to considerable diminution of the
observed induction. In the present series it was impossible
even to fit the 10-coil closely to the bars, as the packing had
to pass within the coils. But the coil of 15 was packed so as
to fit the singles very closely indeed : the error of the corre
sponding value was thus reduced to about two thirds of its
former amount.
   There can be no doubt that the straight line which marks
the course of the lower inductions ought to go to the origin,
instead of falling just below it (see figure above). Then up
to w = 6 wo have i$=«46. This assumes that the value for
n = 6 is correct, since the error due to the coil must be by this
time small. The strengths of the different short bars varied a
  * As originally drawn. The line in the woodcut passes through the
origin instead of a very little below it.

 146                    Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on
 good deal. They were all examined, and an average taken for
 each type.
    In order to ascertain whether the law as to a finite limiting
 moment held good for further subdivision, two short bars were
 constructed of thin disks of sheet steel, hardened, ground, and
 fitted. Of these B had the same diameter as A, C a diameter
 about twice as large. As these bars were short, IS could not
 be accurately ascertained for their subdivisions. But as both
 were well within the linear range, it is assumed that a law
 holds similar to that in the case of A. The value of 3$ for the
 whole bar was ascertained by experiment in each case.

 148               Mr. R. H. M. Bosanquet on
    The moments of B and C were determined by suspending
 the combinations in a tray in the torsion-balance.
    I have hitherto assumed that the resultant magnetism of a
 disk, or short cylinder, acts, as it is commonly supposed to do,
 at the terminal surfaces. It is now clear that the foci, as I
 define them, are at a distance greater than the length of the
 short cylinder. This distance tends to a finite limit for thin
 disks. The limiting focal distance appears to be about three
 fourths of the radius.
    This idea is new to me, though it is an obvious deduction
 from the general appearance of the lines of force. It will
 probably also hold for electromagnets.
    By the foregoing investigation we have reduced the moment
 of the magnet to that of a series of infinitely thin disks,
 which correspond to the magnetic shells of the amperian theory.
 In the case of bar A, for example, the total moment of the
 whole magnet is more than twenty times as great as the
 limiting disk-moment. It now appeared to be of interest to
 see what would be the number of current-turns which would
 be required to demagnetize the magnet temporarily. It was
 to be expected that the moment of the current-turns required
 would be equal to the limiting disk-moment.
    The magnet was enclosed in a coil of 255 turns having
exactly its own length, and was placed on the deflection-scale
near the needle so that it produced a deflection of about 20°.
 A current was then sent through the coil, so as to reduce the
deflection to zero. The first time this is done, it always
reduces the permanent magnetism a little. The value em
ployed must therefore be ascertained before all the other
measurements are made.
         Ampere-turns which demagnetize A = 430.
         Ampere-turns X area of magnet          _
         Limiting disk-moment of A .       .  . = 150.
   It has been mentioned that the distribution of the magnetism
in A was far from uniform. It seems probable that the uni
form coil acts with an advantage over the irregular distribu
tion in the magnet. And if this be the case, we must suppose
that the actual disk-moment of 150 is balanced by the effect
of a uniform coil corresponding to 129. In fact it is known
that a difference of potential localized at a point in a bar, as

                          Permanent Magnets.                           149
by a small coil carrying a current, produces a magnetic short
circuit through the surrounding medium, instead of contribu
ting in full measure to strengthening the general distribution.
However this may be, the broad features are that the total
moment of A, amounting to about 3500, is neutralized by the
action of a coil which would be measured by 129, or some
what less than the disk-moment*. It is clear that the
consideration of moments lends no convenient shape to the
problem.
    Consider instead the magnet as decomposed into a number
of thin disks, each of which can be represented according to
the fundamental convention of electromagnetism by a current
round its edge. Then the number of current-turns is repre
sented by the quotient of the moment by the area.
                                       150
                    In magnet A,              = 49*9 current-turns,
                           &           area                             '
                                              = 499 ampere-turns.
Ampere-turns in demagnetizing coil = 430.
   Allowing, as above, for the discrepancy, we assume for the
present that the demagnetizing current-turns are equivalent
to those of the limiting disk-moment.
    If, therefore, we conceive of a permanent magnet as having
a magnetic potential imbedded in its substance of the same
nature as that which would be due to amperian currents, and
acting on the steel in the same manner as an external potential
 produced by a coil, we have a convenient statement of the
 facts. For the amperian currents, or the potential, have been
 measured in two ways, viz. by cutting up into disks and by
 neutralization with a coil ; and the results are accordant,
 allowing for the imperfections and difficulty of the investi
gation.
    I proceed to develop the mode of accounting for the fore
going facts by Faraday's analogy of the voltaic circuit ; that
is to say, by the application of an analogue of Ohm's law:—
           „

   * The radius of the coil being about l-27 centim., its total moment was
about 218. But it is conceived that the space external to the magnet
cannot have exercised any considerable action on the needle, nor any on
the magnet.

Force, to emphasize the analogy with electromotive force.
Intensity is the same as Magnetic Induction, or lines of force
per unit area, and is represented by 93-
   We will first consider what I have called the linear range ;
that is to say, the case of cylinders whose length does not
exceed ten times their radius, including thin disks.
   We suppose the steel to have a difference of magnetic
potential imbedded in it per unit of length, corresponding to
the values observed.
                                              47rM

coefficient given at (1),
                                              P'
                .*. Magnetic resistance = ^
and is constant within the linear range.
                                        N$J'
   Further, by (1) the value of B' is —j— ;

              Magnetic resistance - -g, =
which is the same as the value of F0 (2).
   It is at once apparent that this must be so. For the resist
ance is the altitude of a cylinder which would have the same
resistance as the actual distribution; and in the case of the disk
this is the same as the distance between the points of appli
cation of the resultants of the lines of force.
   Hence the magnetic resistance throughout the linear range
is constant: it is nearly throe fourths of the radius in A and B,
and about two thirds of the radius in C. This is nearly
equal to the resistance at one end of an open organ-pipe. If
we could arrive at this independently by an extension of
reasoning such as that emplo}-ed in connexion with the open
ends of organ-pipes, we could found the whole theory upon it.
As it is, the admission of this law throws some light on the
laws of the linear range.

which accounts for IS being proportional to the length, or to
the thickness of the disk, the point which it seems impossible
to deal with by the method of induction.
   As to the focal distance, or distance between the points of
application of the resultants, it is easy to see that for thin
disks it must be nearly equal to some constant, which we may
call F„. We can thus establish for the moments of very thin
disks the formula
                  Moment =             (S= area) ;
and putting for 33 its value,

    We cannot deal accurately with the intervening distribu
 tions, as they require the knowledge of the value of F in order
 to obtain the moments from the inductions. But we may
 consider the case, which is not far from the truth, for bars
 whose length is about half the limit of the linear range, viz.
 where we suppose F = x, or f=l, or that the foci are at the
 ends of the bar. It will be seen that this is very nearly true
 for n=3 in bar A. In this case, putting x for F,

   Although it would probably not be easy to determine F by
independent reasoning of a simple character, it is not difficult
to see that it must bo the sum of F0 and some fraction of x

the general exprossion for the moment within the linear

ance increases; the fall of both moments and inductions below
the linear values (see figures to bar A) can be represented as
due to this, as is clear from the formula last written down.

    The increase of the magnetic resistance with the length of
the bar is without doubt to be ascribed to the intrinsic mag
netic resistance of the steel.
    The discovery of the precise laws of magnetic resistance in.
such cases must form the subject of further experiment.
    The bars B and 0 so slightly affect an external needle that
the demagnetization-experiment cannot be made on them with
any accuracy. It is not in any case an experiment of a very
accurate character, and perhaps too much stress may be laid
on the want of exact accordance between its results and
others.

 \If IS have the authority of the Prime Minister for the statement
  * " that the present age is not one abounding in minds of the
first order. Perhaps not, from the popular (t. e. the superficial)
point of view. But that it can hold its own, in this respect, with
any previous age, will undoubtedly be the verdict of posterity.
For the true and only test of a " mind of the first order " is to be
 sought in the creations of that mind, and their influence for good
upon the intellectual and moral progress of our race. It may be
 that there is a dearth of popular idols—literary, artistic, political,
 philosophic, &c. What of that ? Alike in the study of the mathe
matician and in the laboratories of the chemist, the physicist, and
the physiologist, are now being developed ideas, results, and pro
cesses which will have an influence on the future, in comparison
with which the utmost efforts of statecraft are but as a drop in the
bucket. Watt and Faraday, Wohler and Liebig, Lister and
 Pasteur, Helmholtz and Thomson :—what achievement of states

grandeur or in true usefulness, with theirs ?

The quiet, all but unknown, student is in these latter days the real
master of monarchs and of civilization. But such a theme as this
is unsuited to a scientific journal, and must be left to the next
 Vates facer, if such a phenomenon be any longer possible.
    The volume before us is the work of a mind undoubtedly " of
the first order." As usually happens to a great discoverer, Joule's
 earlier efforts were received with coldness, even suspicion ; then
(as Whewell remarked of Forbes and his Glacier-Theory) they
 passed to the second stage, in which they were acknowledged to be
true, but not new. This stage, also, was of short duration, and
 Joule's transcendent merits are now all but universally recognized.

  154                Notice* respecting New Book*.
  Not Copernicus and Galilei, when they abolished the Ptolemaic
 system ; not Newton, when he annihilated the Cartesian vortices ;
 not Young and Fresnel, when they exploded the Corpuscular
 Theory ; not Faraday and Clerk-Maxwell, in their splendid victory
 over Actio in distaiis—more thoroughly shattered a malignant and
 dangerous heresy, than did Joule when he overthrew the baleful
 giant Force, and firmly established, by lawful means, the bene
 ficent rule of the rightful monarch, Eneeqt ! Then, and not till
 then, were the marvellous achievements of Sadi Carnot rendered
 fully available ; and Science silently underwent a revolution more
 swift and more tremendous than ever befel a nation. But this,
 also, must be a theme for the Poet of the Future !
    To be pedantic, if not also prosaic, is the fate (usually self-
 imposed) of most commentators. We will therefore content our
 selves with a brief analysis of the contents of the present volume,
 while expressing the hope that its successor may soon appear ; and
 we offer, in passing, our cordial thanks to the Physical Society for
 this great boon to Science.
    The present volume is confined to papers by Joule himself ; and
the happy adoption of the chronological order enables the reader
 to follow, step by step, the progress of his scientific career. We
can trace how, by his early electromagnetic investigations, he was
led to study the Voltaic pile ; how, in a brief note of 1840 (p. 59),
he puts in a few words the whole experimental laws of the pro
duction of heat by the resistance to the passage of a current ; and
how this, in its turn, led him to the heat of electrolysis, and its
connexion with heat of combination. Then it is, as it were, quite
a natural step to the grand paper " On the Calorific Effects of
Magneto-electricity, and on the Mechanical Value of Heat" (1843).
This paper contains, in an Appendix, the remarkably close approxi
mation to the true value of the Dynamical Equivalent of Heat which
Joule obtained by the friction of water in narrow tubes, and the
first hint of the application of his views to animal physiology. It
was followed in the succeeding year by another epoch-making paper
" On the Changes of Temperature produced by the Harefaction and
Condensation of Air." But it skills not to go through, in this way,
what might be obtained from the mere Index :•—the book must be
read. And the reader who knows only the grander facts for which
Joule now gets credit will certainly at intervals pause, and ponder
on the strange freaks of even scientific history, when he meets with
a well-known fact or theory which, though perhaps it has made the
fame of some more recent investigator, is now seen to have been
given, long ago, by Joule.
   After all, he will probably conclude that " minds of the first
order" are still by no means rare. And he will be confirmed in
that conclusion by every additional volume which appears, of the
collected works of living men like Stokes and Thomson, and of the
mighty dead like Henry Smith and Clerk-Maxwell.

   In his paper on the Drift-beds of the North-west of England,
Part II., Q. J. G. S. 1883, p. 119, the author noticed that the dis
covery of Criffel-granite erratics in the Lancashire drift first made by
Mr. Mackintosh, had been confirmed by Mr. P. Dudgeon, from speci
mens forwarded by the author in 1882. In August of last year, he
had an opportunity of travelling from Dumfries through Kirkcud
bright to Wigtonshire, and of examining the rocks and the boulders
 derived from them. Two masses of granite have broken through
 Silurian strata in Kirkcudbright : the eastern of these granite masses
forms the isolated mountain of Criffel, 1800 feet above the sea ; the
 western rises to 2331 feet, and is known as Cairnsmore of Fleet.
The granite of the former is, as a rule, finer than that of the latter.
 Numerous boulders derived from both are found in the surrounding
 country.
    The author pointed out in detail how different varieties of granite
 observed on Criffel and Cairnsmore of Fleet are clearly the rocks of
 which fragments are found in the drift of Lancashire ; and also
 Bhowed that the Silurian " Grey wackes " through which the granite
 of the mountains named has burst, are also represented by unmis

 wacke " varies in texture from a fine-grained sandstone to a coarse
 gritty sandstone, and in colour from dark blue and grey to deep
 purple-red. These beds, which belong to the Queensbury-grit
 gravels, are well seen in a lino of cliffs called the Craigs of Garhcugh,
 at the side of the road from Glenluce to Fort William. Specimens
 identical with these rocks have been found in the low-level Boulder-
 clay of various parts of Lancashire, as at Great Crosby, Innewick
 Fishery, and the Isle of Whithorn.
    These identifications go far towards completing the identification
 of the rocks represented in the low-level Boulder-clay of Lanca
 shire, and confirm the views already expressed by the author that

   4. "Kipple-marks in Drift." By T. Mellard Roade, Esq., C.E.,
F.G.S.
   Amongst published notices of drift-deposits the author has never
met with any description of ripple-marks, though, if the drift was
formed under water, some should be found. In a spot to which his
attention was called by Dr. Callaway, the Old Park Field sand-hole
at Ketley, near Wellington, Salop, in a Btratified drift-deposit, he
had found early in 1883 three distinct beds of ripple-marked
laminae. One of the ripple-marks in the highest bed measured
9 inches from crest to crest and 1^ inch in height, and had been
produced by a wind from the N.W.
   In July 1883 the author found ripple-marking in hard, fine loamy
brown sand underlying a compact mass of Boulder-clay at Tranmere,
Cheshire, in one of the approaches to the Mersoy Tunnel. The
marks were on a sloping bank, and the sand was faulted in places
with a throw of from 2 to 4 inches. In the sand shell-fragments
occurred, some of them being recognizable as those of Turritetta
terebra, Cardium edule, Telliua balthica, and a Pholas.
   The position of this section in a hollow between higher ground was
favourable to the preservation of ripple-markings. The beds un
doubtedly are those named by the author the Low-Level Boulder-
Clays and Sands.

   1. " On the Structure and Formation of Coal." By E. Wethered,
Esq., F.G.S., F.C.S.
   The author, having referred to tho work of previous investigators,
pointed out that seams of coal do not always occur in one bed, but
are divided by distinct partings, some of which, as in the case of
the Durham main seam, contain StigmarUe. It was important to
notice this feature for several reasons, but especially as the beds of
coal, defined by the partings, showed differences both in quality and
structure. In the case of the shallow seam of Cannock Chase they
had at the top a bed of coal 1 foot 10 inches thick, the brown layers
of which were made up of macrospores and microspores. The
bright layers were of similar construction, except that wood-tissue
sometimes appeared ; also a brown structureless material, which the
author looked upon as bitumen. He, however, objected to that
term, and thought that hydrocarbonaceous substance would be
preferable. What this hydrocarbonaceous material originated from
was a question for investigation. In the lower bed of the Welsh

             On the Structure and Formation of Coal.              157
" Four Feet " seam wood-tissue undoubtedly contributed to it ;
whether spores did was uncertain; it was truo they could be
detected in it. In the second bed of the shallow seam they had a
very different coal from the upper one. It was made up almost as
a whole of hydrocarbonaceous material. Very few spores could be
detected. It was possible that the scarcity of these objects might be
due to decomposition ; but the author's investigations seemed to show
that spores resisted decomposing influences more effectually than
wood-tissue, which seemed to account for the fact that where they
occur they stand out in bold relief against the other material com
posing the coal. Below the central bed of the shallow seam came the
main division. In it the author detected a large accumulation of
spores, but hydrocarbon formed a fair proportion of the mass. The
author referred to other seams of coal from various parts of England,
and pointed out the structure of each bed composing them. The
conclusions on the evidence elicited from his investigations were (1)
that some coals wero practically made up of spores, others were not,
these variations often occurring in the beds of the same seam ; (2)
that the so-called bituminous coals wero largely made up of the sub
stance which the author termed hydrocarbon, to which wood-tissue
undoubtedly contributed.
   An appendix to the paper, written by Prof. Harker, Professor of
Botany and Geology at the Boyal Agricultural College, Cirencester,
dealt with the determination of the spores seen in Mr. "Wethered's
microscopic sections. Taking the macrospores, the resemblance to
those of Isoetes could not fail to strike the botanist. He had
procured some herbarium specimens of Isoetes lanistris in fruit, and
compared the spores with those from the coal. When gently crushed,
the identity of the appearance presented by these forms from the
coal was very striking. The triradiate markings of the latter were
almost exactly like the flattened three radiating lines which mark
the upper hemisphere of the macrospores of Isoetes lacttstris. The
writer therefore concluded that the forms in the coal wero from a
group of plants having affinities with the modern genus Isoetes, and
from this Isoe'toid character he suggested for them the generic title
of Isoetoules, pending further investigation.
    2. " On Strain in connexion with Crystallization and the Deve
 lopment of Perlitic Structure." By Frank Butley, Esq., F.G.S.
    In a paper read before the Society and published in the ' Quar
 terly Journal ' (vol. xxxvii. p. 391) some observations were made
 upon microscopic areas of depolarization in an obsidian tuff from
 Montana, U.S. The paper now read related to a further examina
 tion of similar phenomena in an obsidian from Java. The glass
 adjacent to the numerous crystals occurring in this rock exhibits
 depolarization, as in the case of the Montana tuff. In some instances
 a perlitic structure surrounds the crystals, and the depolarization
 then ends abruptly at. the fissure. One instance is described in
 which such a fissure only partially encircles a crystal, and the de-  '
 polarization is then seen to end abruptly at the fissure and also to

 158                       Geological Society.
 fade away gradually in those directions which are not thus limited.
 The conclusion was, that the depolarization is the result of strain, and
 that the perlitic fission is due to the same cause. It was also sugges
 ted that the development of the crystals may in some cases account
 for this strain, while in other instances similar evidence of strain is
 seen in perlitic areas where no crystal is visible. Other details
 concerning perlitic and spherulitic structure were also discussed.
   3. "Sketches of South-African Geology. No. 1. A Sketch of the
 High-level Coal-field of South Africa." By W. H. Penning, Esq.,
 F.G.S.
   In this paper the author gave a sketch of the High-level Coal
field of the Transvaal aud the neighbouring region. This coal-field
was described as extending 400 miles from north to south, with an
average breadth of 140 miles, so that its area is about 56,000 square
miles. The tract consists of an elevated plateau forming the " High
Veldts " of the Transvaal and the plains of the Orange Free State.
It slopes away to the north-west, and is scarped to the south and
east by the heights known as the Stormberg and Drakensberg
mountains ; nearly all the principal rivers of South Africa take
their rise iu this tract of land. The coal-bearing beds forming the
plateau rest unconformably in the north upon deposits probably of
Upper Palaeozoic age, described as the Megaliesberg beds. In the
south-west the Lower Karoo beds underlie the coal-beds, also un
conformably. The beds of the high grounds consist above of sand
stones, called the " High Veldt beds " by the author, and below
of shales, for which the name of " Kimberley beds " is proposed,
after the chief town of Griqualand West, in which district they form
nearly the whole surface. These two series are conformable, and
generally lie horizontally. In tho shales coal occurs only in minute
patches ; the seams of coal are interstratified with the sandstones,
into which the shales pass up gradually, and which sometimes in
clude thick-bedded grits and conglomerates. Both shales and sand
stones contain interstratifications and numerous dykes of trap,
which have rarely produced much alteration in the sedimentary
beds, from which the author concludes that the eruptions were
subaqueous and contemporaneous or nearly so. Owing to tho
persistent horizontality of the rocks, the mountains and valleys are
merely carved out of the plateau, so that the thickness of the de
posits is easily measured. The author gave 2300 feet as the mini
mum thickness of each series. By a comparative section it was
shown that the coal-bearing sandstones (" High Veldt beds ") are
the " Upper Karoo " of Stow, and the " Stormberg beds " of Dunn.
The " Kimberley beds " are the Upper Karoo beds of Dunn.
   In the latter part of his paper the author noticed briefly the
different localities where coal has been found, namely, Newcastle,
Lauge's Nek, the Lebelelasberg mountains, near New Scotland,
several places on the High Veldt, Wemburg, Brandfoote, Cornet
Spruit, Burgersdorf, and Indwe, twenty miles east of Dordrecht.

    ON THE ELECTROLYSIS OF SOLID GLASS. BY E. WAKBURG.
 fTVELE facts described in this paper may be summarized in the
       following manner :—
    In the electrolysis of lime-soda glass heated to about 300°
 between mercury electrodes, a badly conducting layer of silicic acid
 is formed on the anode side of the glass, which soon reduces the
 strength of the current to a fraction of its original value. This
 layer has a greater or less thickness, according as a greater or
 lesser electromotive force has acted in the circuit in a definite time.
 It is visible, showing the colours of thin plates, diminishes the
 surface-conductivity of the glass in the cold to a fraction of its
 original amount, and at a high temperature, when the mass of the
 glass has become a conductor, it acts like the dielectric of a con
 denser whose coatings are the conducting mass of the glass, and the
 mercury of the anode. The capacity of this condenser was found to
 be independent of the difference of potentials of the coatings, between
 1 and 20 Bunsen's elements ; and for a square centimetre of the
 glass used it varied from 0'021 to 0-041 microfarad, according
 as the layer was formed by 30 or 15 Bunsen's elements acting for
 several hours at 300°.
    The formation of this layer may be avoided by using sodium
 amalgam as anode ; the result of the electrolysis may then be quan
 titatively determined. In this a quantity of sodium is given off at
 the kathode and absorbed at the anode, so that the weight of the
 glass does not vary ; the weight of the sodium is chemically equi
 valent to the weight of the silver which is deposited at the same
 time in the silver voltameter. During electrolysis the glass remains
 perfectly clear ; and it was found that all the properties of the

glass were not appreciably altered by electrolysis.—Wiedemann's
Annalen, No. 4, 1884.
          ON PHENOMENA OF DIFFRACTION IN MOIST AIR.
                           BY M. KISSL1NG.
   In a thorough experimental investigation into the influence which
foreign admixtures exert on the formation of fog in moist air—an
influence first established by Coulier and Mascart, and then by
Aitkin—the author has observed a series of phenomena of diffrac
tion, the development of which, and the law of whose formation,
can only with difficulty be made to agree with Frauuhofer's law of
the phenomena of diffraction ; they are, on the other hand, in
obvious connexion with the phenomena of twilight, which have
receutly excited such universal interest. The author only gives
briefly the most important results of his experimental investigation.
   The phenomena are produced in a tube closed by two parallel
glass plates, through which the diaphragm of an Argand burner
placed at a suitable distance was observed.
   The author found that Aitkin's law was in general confirmed,
namely, that when aqueous vapour is condensed in the air, this
always takes place on some solid nucleus. Thus, in the ordinary un-
liltered air of a dwelling-room, where the space in which diffraction
occurs is but slightly cooled, the fog is so strong that it greatly
enfeebles even a powerful source of light. If the unfiltered air be
gradually admixed with filtered air, the formation of fog gradually
diminishes, while at the same time phenomena of diffraction set in,
the intensity of whose colour increases until the quantity of vapour
has sunk to a certain, extremely small amount. As the filtration
is continued, the coloured phenomena become rapidly less intense,
and a formation of fog can no longer be perceived. It must be
observed that by "vapour" the author understands the totality of
all foreign constituents in atmospheric air with the exception of
water. If the degree of moisture in the diffraction-space is dimi
nished, so that it is only slightly removed from its point of satura
tion, an exceedingly rapid decrease of the production of colour sets
in. It is found in general that the absolute maximum of the
phenomena of diffraction is conditioned by the coincidence of that
amount of vapour which is most favourable to light, with the
maximum moisture in the layer in question.
   Small admixtures of 802 and K1I3 with the unfiltered air of a
room produce so strong a fog, that any action of diffraction
ceases.
   Finely divided dust of pumice from Krakatoa exerted a per
ceptible, though small, influence on the formation of fog.—

XXII. On the Spectral Lines of the Metals developed by Explo
   ding Gases. By Gr. D. Liveing, M.A., F.R.S., Professor
   of Chemistry, and James Devvar, M.A., F.R.S.. Jacksonian
   Professor, in the University of Cambridge* .
     OT long since Berthelot published the results of some
        investigations, by means of a chronograph, of the rate
of propagation of the explosion of mixtures of oxygen with
hydrogen and other gases. He found that in a mixture of
oxygen and hydrogen in the proportions in which thoy occur
in water, the explosion progressed along a tube at the rate of
2841 metres per second ; not far from the velocity of mean
square for hydrogen particles, on the dynamic theory of gases,
at a temperature of 2000°.
   This is a velocity which, though very far short of the
velocity of light, bears a ratio to it which cannot be called
insensible. It is in fact about yTrsVfio Par^' °f      Hence if
the explosion were advancing towards tho eye, the waves of
light would proceed from a series of particles lit up in succes
sion at this rate. This would be equivalent to a shortening of
the wave-length of the light by about TTTsVsafi part ; and in
the case of the yellow sodium lines would produce a shift of
the lines towards the more refrangible side of the spectrum by
a distance of about TJT of the space between the two lines. It
would require an instrument of very high dispersive power and
                  • Communicated bv the Authors.

162     Profs. Liveing and Dewar on the Spectral Lines
sharply defined lines to make such a displacement appreciable.
With lines of longer wave length than the yellow sodium
lines, the displacement would be proportionately greater.
Further, if a receding explosion could be observed simul
taneously with an advancing explosion, the relative shift of
the line would be doubled, one imago of the line observed
being thrown as much towards the less-refrangible side of its
proper position as the other was thrown towards the more-
refrangible side. The two images of the red line of lithium
would inQthis way be separated by a distance of about J of a
unit, of Angstrom's scale; a quantity quite appreciable, though
much less than the distance between the components of A3, and
about equal to the distance of the components of the less
refrangible of the pair of lines E. We thought therefore that
we might test theory by experiment.
   A preliminary question had, however, to be answered.
What lines could be seen in the flash of the exploding gases ?
We were pretty certain that the hydrogen lines could not be
seen, but that probably we might get sufficient dust of sodium
compounds floating in the gas to make the sodium lines
visible. A preliminary observation was made on the flash of
mixed hydrogen and oxygen in a Cavendish's eudiometer,
which showed not only the yellow sodium lines, but the orange
and green bands of lime and the indigo line of calcium all
very brightly, as well as other lines not identified. Tho flash
is very instantaneous, but nevertheless produces a strong im
pression on the eye ; and by admitting the light of a flame
into the spectroscope at the same time as that of the flash, the
identity of the lines was established. That sodium should
make itself seen was not surprising, but that the spectrum of
lime should also be so bright had not been anticipated. At
first wo thought that some spray of tho water over which the
gases were confined must have found its way into the eudio
meter ; but subsequent observations led us rather to suppose
that the lime was derived from the glass of the eudiometer.
The lime-spectrum made its appearance when the eudiometer
was quite clean and dry, and when the gases had been stand
ing over water for a long time.
   Io obtain the high dispersion requisite, as already explained,
we made use of one of Rowland's magnificent gratings, with
a ruled surface of 2>\ by 2\ inches, and the lines 14,438 to the
inch. One telescope fitted with a collimating eyepiece served
both as collimator and observing-telescope; and by this means
we were able to use the spectra of the third and fourth orders
with good effect.
   Observations were made with this instrument on explosions

         of the Metals developed by Exploding Gases.          163
in an iron tube shown in section in fig. 1, half an inch in
diameter, fitted at the end with a thick glass plate (a), held on
by a screw- cap (<•) and made tight with leaden washers.
Small lateral tubes (d d), at right angles to the main tube, were
brazed into it near the two ends, for the purpose of connect
ing it with the air-pump, admitting the gases, and firing
them. For this last purpose a platinum wire (6) fused into
glass was cemented into the small tube, so that an electric
spark could be passed from the wire to the sido of the small
tube when the gases were to be exploded.
   To bring out the lithium lines, a small quantity of lithium
carbonate in fine powder was blown into the tube before the
cap with glass plate was screwed on. Powder was used
because we supposed that it must be loose dust which would
be lighted up by the explosion.         The lithium lines came
out bright enough, and it was unnecessary to put in any more
lithium for any number of explosions. The tube was of
course quite wet after the first explosion from the water
formed, but the lithium lines were none the less strong.
Indeed, after the tube had been very thoroughly washed out, the
lithium lines continued to be visible at each explosion, though
less brightly than at first. A good deal of continuous spec
trum accompanies the flash which, from the overlapping of
spectra of different orders, makes observations difficult, so a
screen of red glass was used to cut this off when the lithium
red line was under observation. In any case, however, close
observation of the flashes is very trying, from the suddenness
with which the illumination appears and the briefness of its
duration. At first we compared the lithium line given by the
flash of the exploding gases with that produced by the flame
of a small Bunsen burner in which a bead of fused lithium
carbonate was held, both being in the field at once. While
the flame-line was sharply defined, the flash-line had a different

164     Profs. Liveing and Dewar on tJie Spectral Lines
character and was always diffuse at the edges ; so that it was
not possible in this way to substantiate the minute difference
of wave-length indicated by theory, though the flash-line
certainly seemed a little the more refrangible of the two.
   We then tried taking the explosion in a tube bent round so
as to be returned upon itself, the two parts of the tube being
Parallel to each other, and the glass ends side by side (fig. 2).
  he axis of the collimator (T) was made to coincide with that
of one limb of the tube, so that the flash in that limb was
seen directly; and by means of two reflecting prisms (r, r) the
light from the other limb was thrown into the slit, and the
two images were seen simultaneously one above the other.
As the gas was ignited from one end of the tube, the flash
was seen receding in one limb, approaching in the other, so
that the displacement of the two lines would be doubled.
Still we were unable to substantiate any relative displacement
of the lines on account of their breadth and diffuse character.
By washing out the tube the breadth of the lines was con
siderably reduced, but they remained diffuse at the edges,
and baffled any observation sufficiently accurate to establish a
displacement. Certainly there appeared to be a very slight
displacement, but it was not so definite that one could bo sure
of it.
   These observations, however, led us to some other interesting
results. In the first place, one of the two images of the
lithium line almost always was reversed—that is, showed a
dark line down the middle. This was the line given by the
flash approaching the slit. The receding flash in the other
limb of the tube gave as broad a bright lino, but it had no
dark line in its middle. This observation was made a great
many times; and the fact of the reversal established inde
pendently in the case of some other metallic lines by means of
photographs. These reversals show that in the wave of
explosion the temperature of the gases does not reach its
maximum all at once ; but the front of the wave is cooler than
the part which follows and absorbs some of its radiation, while
 the rear of the wave does not produce the same effect. One
would suppose that there must be cooler lithium-vapour in tli9
 rear of the wavo as well as in its front ; but it is possible that
 the absorption produced by it extends over the whole width of
 the line, and not only over a narrow strip in the middle. For
 we observed that when a little lithium carbonate was freshly
 put into the tube, the red line was so much expanded as to fill
 the whole field of view—that is to say, it was some ten or
 twelve times as wide as the distance between the two yellow
 lines of sodium ; but by washing out the tube with water

           of the Metals developed by Exploding Gases.         165
  (that is, by reducing the quantity of lithium present in the
 tube), the line could be reduced in width until it was no wider
 than one tenth of the distance between the two sodium lines.
 This seems to prove that the breadth of the line is directly
 dependent on the amount of lithium present.
    M. Fievez has, in a recent publication (Bulletins de VAca-
 dimie royale de JJelc/i'/ue), concluded, from observations on
 sodium, that the widening of the lines is solely due to eleva
 tion of temperature. The flash of the exploding gases cannot
 be raised in temperature by the presence of a minute quantity
 more of a lithium compound; so that in our case the widening
 cannot be ascribed to any thing but the increase in the quan
 tity of lithium present, or to some consequence of that in
 crease. It is not improbable that the amount of lithium
 vaporized in the front of the wave of explosion is less than in
 the following part, and hence the absorption-lino is not so
 wide as the bright line behind it, while in the rear of the wave
 the absorption extends over the whole width of the bright
 band, and so is nob so easily noticed. Only twice amongst
 many observations was any reversal of the lithium line seen
 in the receding wave of explosion.
    On observing the flash with a spectroscope of small disper
 sion instead of that with the grating, the continuous spectrum
"was very bright, but the metallic lines stood out still brighter;
 not only the red line of lithium, but the orange, the green,
 and the blue lines were very bright, and continued so when
 the pressure of the gases before explosion was reduced from
 one atmosphere to one third of an atmosphere. The violet
 line was not seen, but it may have been so much expanded as
 to be lost in the continuous spectrum ; for it showed in a
 photograph afterwards taken. Other lines were, however,
 seen—the sodium yellowlines, the calcium indigo line, a group
 of other blue lines, and a group of green lines, amongst which
 one line was conspicuous, and this line, by comparison with
 the solar spectrum, was identified with E. We had not ex
 pected to see any lines of iron, as iron and its compounds
 give no lines in the flame of a Bunsen burner, and we sup
 posed that it would only be volatilized at a much higher
 temperature. But the appearance of E suggested that other
 of the green and blue lines might be due to iron; so wo pro
 ceeded to compare the positions of these lines with those of
 the electric spark between iron electrodes. For this purpose
 one of the spark-lines was first brought carefully on to the
 pointer, or cross wires, in the eye-piece of the observing tele
 scope, and then, the passage of the spark being stopped, the
 flash of the exploding gases was observed. It was not diffi

166     Profs. Liveing and Dewar on the Spectral Lines
cult to see whether any line was on the pointer; and the
observation could be repeated as many times as was desired
without any shift of the apparatus. Nine of the most conspi
cuous green and yellowish-green lines in the flash were thus
identified with lines of iron. For the blue and violet we
adopted the photographic method as much less trying to the
eyesight. Eight to twelve flashes were taken in succession
without any shift of the apparatus, so as to accumulate their
effects on the photographic plate. Eight flashes were found
enough in general to produce a good impression, and more
than twelve could not well be taken without turning out the
water which accumulated in the tube, and cleaning the glass
which closed its end. After the flashes had been taken, but
without shifting the photographic plate, the slit of the spec
troscope was partly covered, and the electric spark between
iron points passed in front of the slit. We had thus on the
plate the photograph of the flash as well as of the spark.
Fourteen more lines in the indigo and violet were thus iden
tified with iron lines; and on extending the photographs into
the ultra-violet, and substituting quartz lenses and prisms for
the glass ones hitherto used, a much larger number of lines
were identified. There could be no doubt, then, that we had
iron vapour in the flash. We supposed that it must be de
rived from dust of oxide shaken by the explosion off the sides
of the tube, and we had the tube bored out clean and bright
like a gun-barrel. This made no diminution in the brightness
or number of the lines; and we came to the conclusion that
the explosion detached particles of iron from the tube, and
converted them into vapour. This was confirmed by finding
that, however carefully the tube had been cleaned, the glass
ends always became clouded with a rusty deposit after ten or
twelve flashes. Altogether 68 lines of iron have been iden
tified in the flash, of which about 40 lie in the ultra-violet
between H and 0. Only one iron line above 0 has been
definitely identified, and that in only a few photographs. It
isT.
   As iron gave so many lines in the flash it was reasonable
to suppose that more volatile metals would give their lines
too. Linings of thin sheet copper, lead, cadmium, zinc,
aluminium, and tin were successively put into the tube, and
their effects on the flash observed. Copper gave one strong
line in the green (wave-length 5104"9), but no other line in
the visible part of the spectrum. In the ultra-violet two
strong lines between Q and R came out in the photographs,
frequently as reversed lines. Some of the photographs showed
also something of the shaded bands in the blue which are

            of the Metals developed by Exploding Gases.        167
 ascribed to the oxide of copper. The green line of copper
 had been observed in the flash before the copper lining was
 put into the tube; and wo concluded that the copper was de
 rived from the brass with which the small lateral tubes were
 fastened into the large tube, or that the iron of the tube con
 tained a little copper. When the leaden lining was used, only
 one visible line of lead was developed, and that was the strong
 violet line, but two ultra-violet lines between M and N were
 strongly depicted on the photographic plates. The violet line
 of lead had also been observed in many of the photographs
 taken before the leaden lining was introduced. This we
 ascribed to the leaden washers used to make the glass or
 quartz plates air-tight. The line was greatly increased in
 strength by the leaden lining. The zinc lining gave no
 visible line at all, notwithstanding the easy volatility of the
 metal; and in the ultra-violet it gave only a very doubtful
 impression of one of the lines near P. The cadmium, alumi
 nium, and tin linings gave no lines at all. Zinc dust put
 into the tube gave no zinc lines, merely increased the conti
 nuous spectrum; and speedily rendered the quartz end opaque.
    A clean wire of magnesium put into the tube gave the b
 group of lines, but no other line. No trace of the blue lino,
 so conspicuous in the flame of burning magnesium, nor of the
 triplets near L and S, nor of the very strong line, the strongest
 of all in the arc. at wave-length 2852. bx and b2 were well
seen; but as 64 is an iron line, as well as a magnesium line,
and the iron line was visible in the flash before the magne
sium wire was introduced, we cannot bo sure whether the
magnesium line, as well as the iron line, was present in the
flash. Magnesia did not develop any line at all; merely
augmented the continuous spectrum.
    Compounds of sodium, such as the carbonate and chloride,
introduced in powder gave the ultra-violet line between P
and Q strongly, frequently reversed ; but no other line except
of course D. Potassium compounds developed, often reversed,
the pair of violet lines, and also the ultra-violet pair near 0,
but no others.
   A strip of silver developed two ultra-violet lines, one on
either side of P; but we could not detect in tho flash tho well-
known green lines of that metal. When powder of silver
oxalate was introduced, the yellowish-green line (w.l. 54(34)
¦was seen at the first explosion but not afterwards. As silver
oxalate is itself an explosive compound, decomposing with an
evolution of heat, it is reasonable to ascribe the appearance of
this line at the first explosion to the extra temperature so
engendered.

 168      Profs. Liveing and Dewar on the Spectral Lines
    Strips of copper, electro-plated with nickel, brought out
 almost all the strong nickel lines in the ultra-violet between
 K and Q; 25 were photographed. When nickel oxalate was
 put in so as to give a powder of metallic nickel after the first
 explosion, the same lines were developed, and three additional
 lines in the ultra-violet. Only one line was seen in the
 visible part of the spectrum, and that was the yellowish-green
 line (w.l. 5476).
    Copper wires electro-plated with cobalt gave in the flash
 22 lines in the violet and ultra-violet, between G and P; no
 lines beyond those limits. Cobalt oxalate gave no more.
    No other metal gave anything like so many lines as iron,
nickel, and cobalt; and it is remarkable that almost all the
 lines of these metals developed in the flash lie in the same
 region between G and P.
    We expected that manganese would have given several
lines in the flash ; but it was not so. Neither metallic man
 ganese, nor any of several compounds which we tried, gave
us any lines of that metal except the violet triplet, and this
was generally given by the iron tube alone, and was merely
stronger for the manganese put in. The green channellings
characteristic of manganese, and ascribed to the oxide, were,
however, well seen when metallic manganese was used.
    Chromium, introduced as bichromate of ammonia, which of
course became chromium oxide at the first flash, gave three
triplets in the green, the indigo, and the ultra-violet near N
respectively, but no other lines.
    Bismuth, antimony, and arsenic gave no lines, nor did
mercury spread over a sheet of copper lining the tube.
 Several metals were tried as amalgams spread over such a
piece of copper, but with no fresh results, except in the case
of thallium, which gave the green line strongly, the strong
line between L and M, and two lines between N and 0.
    On the whole it does not appear that the form in which the
metal is introduced into the tube makes much difference.
The merest traces of those which gave lines were sufficient.
Generally when a metal had been put into the tube, its lines
continued to show after the strip or lining had been removed.
Thus, after the nickel strips had been taken out, and the tubo
cleaned out as completely as it could be mechanically, the
nickel lines still came out in the flash, and the same was the
case with other metals.
   The strongest part of the water-spectrum, from s to near R,
generally impressed itself moro or less on the photographic
plate; but, with the exception of T, which was only developed
onco or twice, no lines made their appearance in the region
more refrangible than s.

         of the Metals developed by Exploding Gases.                      169
   Thus far the experiments had been made with the gases at
the atmospheric pressure, or nearly so, before ignition. The
proportions of hydrogen and oxygen were nearly two to one;
but an excess of either gas to the extent of one fifth did not
sensibly affect the results.
   Other explosive mixtures were tried. Carbonic oxide with
oxygen, and marsh-gas with oxygen, developed in general
the same lines as the hydrogen mixture, but gave a much
brighter continuous spectrum. Sulphuretted hydrogen, ar-
seniuretted hydrogen, and antimoniuretted hydrogen, exploded
with oxygen, also gave very bright continuous spectra, but
no lines attributable to sulphur, arsenic, or antimony.
   We have also tried explosions at higher pressures ; mixtures
of hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and marsh-gas respectively, with
oxygen, were compressed into the tube by a condensing
syringe until the pressure reached two and a half atmospheres,
and in some cases three and a half atmospheres. The general
effect of increasing the pressure was to strengthen very much
the continuous spectrum, and also to intensify the bright
lines, so that photographs could be taken with a smaller num
ber of explosions. The lines previously observed to be re
versed were more strongly reversed, but no new lines which
we can attribute to the metals employed were noticed. No
iron line more refrangible than T showed itself in the photo
graphs. But a banded spectrum, of which traces had been
noticed in the flash of the gases at lower pressure, came out
decidedly. This spectrum occupies the region between P and
R; it is not a regularly channelled spectrum, though pro
bably under higher dispersion it would resolve itself into
groups of lines like the water-spectrum. In fact it seems to
us most probable that it is a development of the water-spectrum,
dependent on the pressure.
   It seems very remarkable that metals so little volatile as
iron, nickel, and cobalt should develop so many lines * in the
flash, while more volatile metals show few or no lines. We
do not know that any lines attributed to the metals, as dis
tinct from their compounds, which have been observed in the
gas-flame cannot be seen also in the flash of the exploding
gases, unless they be the blue lines of zinc which Lecoq de
Boisbaudran has seen faintly in the gas-flame when zinc
chloride was introduced. These are, however, so faint in the
flame, that they might easily escape notice in the much
stronger continuous spectrum of the flash. But iron, nickel,
and cobalt show no lines of those metals in a gas-flame.

 170     Profs. Liveing and Dewar on the Spectral Lines
 mixing vapour of ferric chloride with the hydrogen burnt in
 an oxyhydrogen-jet, obtained a number of the lines of iron.
 These form three groups—one below D, one near E, and one
 near G. The last two groups have a general correspondence
 with the lines developed in the explosions in the visible part
 of the spectrum ; but exact identification is not possible with
 his figure. Of other metals be seems also to have found the
 same lines in the oxyhydrogen-jet which we have seen in the
 explosions, but with additional lines in several cases. Thus
 he found three zinc and as many cadmium Hues, two of
 mercury, four of copper, and so on.
    Gouy (C R. 1877, p. 232) has observed in the inner green
 cone of a modified Bunsen burner fed with gas mixed with
 spray of iron-salts, four green lines of iron which we did not
 find in the flash. He saw two of the blue lines, but not the
 other lines which we have noticed. In like manner with
 cobalt, he observed two feeble blue rays which we did not
 see in the explosions ; also one zinc, one cadmium, and one
 silver line which we did not see ; and he did not notice the
 green copper line which we always have seen in the ex
plosions. In other cases he has noticed the same lines that
we have noticed.
    Comparing the spectrum of the explosions with that of
iron wire burnt in a jet of coal-gns fed with oxygen, they
may be called identical. We find in them generally the same
lines and the same relative strengths of the lines. For in
stance, in the explosion-spectrum the strength of the groups
of lines on either side of M and the line at wave-length 3859-2
is decidedly greater as compared with the other lines than it
is in the arc-spectrum of iron. It is the same in that of iron
burnt as above mentioned. T, however, comes out more
strongly in the last^mentioned spectrum than in the ex
plosions.
    German-silver wire burnt in the coal-gas and oxygen jet
gave the same nickel and copper lines as were developed in
the explosions. Silver wire gave in the same jet the two
silver lines near P, but no channelled spectrum. Spray of
cobalt chloride gave also the same lines as in the explosions,
with a few additional ; while spray of manganese chloride
gave the strong manganese triplet at wave-length about 2800,
more refrangible than anything observed in the explosions,
besides the usual violet triplet,
   On the whole the spectra produced by the jet of coal-gas
and oxygen are very similar to those of the explosions as far
as the metallic lines go ; they exhibit a few more lines, or it
may be these are more easily observed.

          of the Metals developed by Exploding Gases.        171
   Of the green and blue lines of iron seen by us in explosions
nine are registered by Watts as occurring in the flame of a
Bessemer converter ; or at least the lines he gives are so near
that we cannot doubt their identity.
   When we come to make a comparison with the spectrum
of the spark-discharge from a solution of ferric chloride, the
differences become more marked. Not only are there many
more lines in the spark-spectrum, but the relative intensities
of those lines which are common to both spark and explosion
are very different, and two of the iron lines seen in the ex-
Elosions appear to be absent from the spark. The differences
  etween the spectrum of the spark taken from a liquid elec
trode and that given by solid electrodes has usually been
attributed to the lower temperature of the former ; but the
absence from the former spectrum of the line at wave-length
4132, and the feebleness of the line at wave-length 4143, both
strong lines in the arc and in the explosions, as well as in the
spark between solid electrodes, seem to indicate that the dif
ferences of spark-spectra are not simply due to differences of
temperature. In fact we know so little about the mechanism,
so to speak, of the changes of electric energy into heat, and
of heat into radiation, that there is no good reason for assu
ming that the energy which takes the form of radiation in the
electric discharge through a gas must first take the form of
the motion of translation of the particles on which tempera
ture depends. The gas may, for a short time, be intensely
luminous at a very low temperature ; and if the impulses
which give rise to the vibratory movements of the particles
be of different characters, the characters of the vibrations also
may differ within certain limits.
   Leaving, however, the realms of speculation, we may
mention that we have before observed the spectrum of iron at
a temperature intermediate between that of the oxyhydrogen-
jet and that of the electric arc.
   Some time since (Proc. R. S. xxxiv. p. 119, and Proc.
Camb. Phil. Soc. iv. p. 25(5) we described the spectrum pro
ceeding from the interior of a carbon tube strongly heated by the
electric arc playing on the outside. This spectrum approaches
more nearly to that of the arc inasmuch as it shows all, or
almost all, the iron lines given by the arc between F and 0,
and the aluminium pair between H and K ; but it resembles
the explosion-spectrum in the relative strength of some of the
iron lines, and in the absence of almost all iron lines between
0 and T. The iron lines seen reversed against the hot walls
of the carbon-tube correspond with the strongest of the ex
plosion-lines j the strong lines near M and a little below L in

 the explosions being those most strongly reversed in the
 photographs of the carbon-tube. The greater complete
 ness and extent of the iron spectrum, as well as the pre
 sence of the aluminium lines, which are entirely wanting
 in the explosion-spectrum, indicate that the temperature of
 the tube was higher than that of the explosion. That
 iron, nickel, and cobalt are volatile in some degree at the
 temperature of the explosion appears to be proved, and
 makes the appearance of iron lines at the very apices of solar
 prominences, as observed by Young, less astounding than it
 seemed to be at first sight. The ascending current of gas
 making the prominence may very well carry iron vapour with
 it; or we may not unreasonably suppose that there is meteoric
 dust containing iron everywhere in the outer atmosphere of
 the sun, which becomes volatilized, and emits the radiation
 observed, when it is heated up by the hot current of the pro
 minence. What the temperature of such a current may be
 we cannot well gauge, but it is high enough to give the
 hydrogen -spectrum, of which no trace has been observed in
 the flash of the explosions or in the oxyhydrogen-jet. The
 temperature of the explosions we know with tolerable accu
 racy, at least when the gases are at atmospheric pressure to
 begin with. Bunsen (Phil. Mag. 18G7, p. 4!)4) found the
 pressure of the explosion was for hydrogen and oxygen 9-6
 atmospheres, and for carbonic oxide and oxygen 10 3 atmo
 spheres, and he calculated the corresponding temperatures to
 be 2844° and 3033°. Recently published observations by
 Berthelotand Vieille (Comptes liendvs, 1884, p. 548) put the
 pressure of explosion of oxygen and hydrogen at 9'8 atmo
 spheres and of carbonic oxide and oxygen at 10*1, and the
 corresponding temperatures 3240° and 3334°. The pressures
 determined by the two observers agree closely, and the calcu
lated temperatures are not very discordant. On the whole,
we cannot be wrong in assuming the temperature of the
 exploding gases to be about 3000°; and we see that at this
 degree such metals as iron, nickel, and cobalt are vaporous
 and emit many characteristic rays, and that by far the greatest
part of these rays lie between narrow limits of refrangibility
G and P. Even for other metals there is a predominance of
rays in the same part of the spectrum. The lines of lead,
potassium, and manganese, three out of four lines of thallium,
and two thirds of those of chromium, observed in the explo
sions, fall within the same region. It must not bo inferred
that these facts indicate the limit of the rate of oscillation
which can be set up in consequence of an elevation of tempe
rature to 3000", because we know that the spectrum of the

   On Normal Elements for Electrometric Measurements.               173
lime-light extends much further. But it might he possible
to establish a sort of spectroscopic scale of temperatures if
the lines which are successively developed as the temperature
rises were carefully noted. Thus the appearance of the iron
line T seems to synchronize with temperature of about 3000°.
The lithium blue line is invisible in the flame of an ordinary
Bunsen burner, but is just visible at the temperature of the
inner green cone formed by reducing the proportion of gas
to air in such a burner, while in the exploding gas the green
line too is seen. It seems to need a temperature above 3000°
to get the aluminium lines at H. Probably no line is ever
abruptly brought out at a particular temperature—it will
always be gradually developed as the temperature rises; yet
the development may be rapid enough to give an indication
which may be useful in default of means of more exact
measurement. In former papers treating of spectroscopic
problems (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xxxiv. p. 130, and xxix. p. 489)
we have more than once adverted to the necessity of the study
of the spectra both of flames and of the electric discharge
under modified conditions of pressure. The projected expe
riments on the arc in lime-crucibles have not yet been carried
out; but the present is a first instalment of a study of flame-
spectra under such conditions.
XXIII. On Normal Elementsfor Electrometric Measurements.
                          By H. W. Bketz\
IN order to measure a difference of potential in absolute
       units a normal element is required, having a perfectly
definite electromotive force, which can either be put together
once for all, or can always be set up in exactly the same
way and without too much trouble. According to Kittler's
experimentsf, a Daniell element, having a porous cell, does
not at all fulfil these conditions, since its electromotive
force is subject to continuous change. On the other hand,
an element composed of chemically pure zinc and pure
copper, in dilute sulphuric acid and copper-sulphate solution
of definite strength, the solutions being placed in connexion
by means of a siphon-tube terminating in small openings and
filled with the same sulphuric acid, has always the same elec
tromotive force, and since it can easily be put together, forms

174            Prof. H. W. Beetz on Normal Elements
a convenient standard cell. Using concentrated copper-
sulphate solution and dilute sulphuric acid of specific gravity
1*075, Kittler found the electromotive force of such an ele
ment to be 1*195 volt, which decreased to 1*059 volt when
the dilute sulphuric acid was replaced by concentrated zinc-
sulphate solution.
    Of the Daniell elements hitherto employed for measurement
of difference of potential, that of Raoult* best fulfils the con
ditions here laid down ; that of Lodgef, employing dilute
zinc-sulphate solution, less satisfactorily; whilst combinations
containing porous cells, such as that proposed by Buff J, are
still less suited to serve as normal elements.
   But none of these are able to maintain a constant electro
motive force, as is now desirable for electrometric measure
ments, since in all gradual diffusion of the liquids takes place.
I myself § have formerly made use of similarly arranged
normal elements, for measurements made according to the
compensation-method ; but they do not answer for electro-
metric measurements, and I have therefore been obliged con
tinually to renew the element. For the length of time during
which unbroken observation with the electrometer is usual,
we may rely upon the constancy of the element.
    The frequent putting together and taking apart of an
element is a labour always willingly avoided. Hence the
permanently-connected zinc and mercury element of Latimer
Clark || was gladly welcomed. Its electromotive force (1*457
volt) was found nearly constant in different preparations of
the element according to the method described. But it has
two undesirable properties : the one is the great variation of
electromotive force with change of temperature, which, how-
over, is easily allowed for in calculation, but which does not
existIT in the case of the Daniell elements ; the other is the
great decrease which the electromotive force suffers if the cir
cuit is closed even for a very short time. This may easily occur.
An unintentional contact in some of the auxiliary apparatus
employed in the measurements, for example in the key which
I have described**, is sufficient to render the element useless
for one or several days. I obtained a diminution of electro
motive force, amounting to 2 per cent., in a Latimer-Clark

element in which the circuit had been closed for only half a
minute. A Daniell element would have shown scarcely any
change under similar conditions.
    But this defect of the Latimer-Clark element may be almost
 entirely remedied by giving to the cell so great a resistance
that only an insignificant current can be generated.
    A U-tube of 1 cenfim. diameter and legs 75 centim. long
was filled with the paste of mercury-sulphate and zinc-sulphate
 solution, prepared according to the instructions, but heated so
 much that after cooling it became hard. The paste was boiled
 in the tube by means of a water air-pump. The zinc pole
 was introduced into the upper end of the tube and the mer
 cury pole into the lower, and the openings were closed with
paraffin. The element is very convenient for use on the
laboratory-table, since the two poles may pass through holes
 bored in the table, the whole body of the tube being protected
 underneath the table. The internal resistance of the element
 was 15,700 ohms*. Its electromotive force was somewhat
 smaller than given by Latimer Clark. If, in fact, the electro
motive force of a normal Daniell cell (with dilute sulphuric
acid) betaken as T195 volt, then that of my mercury element
was 1-442 volt (instead of 1-457 volt). When the element
 was short-circuited, its electromotive force was as follows :—
              After 5 minutes . . .          l-440 volt.
                 „ 1 hour ....               1*439 „
                 „ 4 hours ....              1-439 „
                 „ 6 „         ....          1-437 „
                 „ 12 „        ....          1-434 „
                „ 48 „         ....          1-408 „
    We see therefore that the element resists the influence of
polarization for a long time. Polarization could indeed only
be very slight, since the current which passed through the
element has only the intensity of 0'000091 ampere. The
electromotive force only diminished 2 per cent, after use for
48 hours, a decrease which is very small indeed compared
with the falling off" in the usual form of the Latimer-Clark
element. It is easy to avoid short-circuiting the element
for such a length of time ; but if the element has once become
enfeebled, it recovers itself only slowly. Thus, after 24 hours
I found its strength to be 1-430 volt.
    The idea of replacing the fluid of an element by a solid
body may be carried out also with a Daniell element. Fine
alabaster plaster-of-Paris was mixed with concentrated copper-
   * The resistances were measured by my first assistant, Dr. Pfeiffer, by
the use of alternate currents.

sulphate solution to about the consistency employed in making
plaster casts, and some more with concentrated zinc-sulphate
solution. A U-shaped glass tube, of 4 millim. diameter and
with legs 22 centim. long, was partly filled with the one paste,
and after it had set was filled up with the other, so that the
two were in closo contact. A copper wire was introduced
into the copper paste before it had set, and a zinc wire into
the zinc paste. The upper part of each leg was cleared from
plaster and filled up with paraffin.
   Several dry Daniell elements thus prepared were compared
with an element put together with concentrated solutions of
copper sulphate and zinc sulphate, and tested in respect of
the effect of change of temperature and of short-circuiting.
Taking the electromotive force of the liquid element as equal
to unity, the three dry elements L, II., and III. gave, when
measured on different days :—
                   i.     "      n.             in.
                0- 996         0-993           1-000
                0 998          0-996           0 996
                1-000          0-999           0993
                               0-998           0-998
     Mean . . 0 998            0-996           0-997
   The temperature varied in all these observations by a few
degrees only ; the small apparent variations in the electro
motive force of th9 dry elements are partly at least accounted
for by small changes in the electromotive force of the fluid
element, which was put together fresh each time. On the
whole, however, the dry element is a little weaker than tho
fluid element ; it contains no amalgamated zinc, because such
amalgamated wires are very brittle.
   A second series of experiments was concerned with the
influence of temperature. The elements II. and III., some
times at the temperature of the air, sometimes in baths of
different temperatures, were compared with the fluid element,
which had always a temperature of nearly 20 °C. On account
of the small conducting-power of the dry elements for heat,
they remained always three quarters of an hour in the bath
before the measurements were made. If the electromotive
force of the fluid element is again taken as unity, that of the
dry element was as follows:—
                          n.                           nr.
     At 0               0-996      At 1               1-007

                                     „ 55             0 981

                for Electrometric Measurements.                177
   The decrease in electromotive force of each of the two ele
ments for low temperatures between 0° and 20° amounted to
only 0'015 per cent, for an increase in temperature of 1°.
But the temperature-coefficient increases with increase of
temperature. With element II. it amounted to 0-053 between
20° and 30°; with element III. to 0-045 between 21° and 32°,
and between 32° and 55° even to 0-061. For Latimer-Clark's
element, Helmholtz and von Kittler* agree in finding it to be
0'08. Within the narrow limits within which electrometric
measurements are commonly made, the influence of tempera
ture upon the electromotive force of the dry Daniell element
may be altogether neglected.
   The effect of short-circuiting is seen from the following
experiments made with elements I., II., III.
   The element was short-circuited for a certain length of
time, then contact was broken, and the difference of potential
measured. We do not thus obtain actually the lowest value
which the difference of potential may attain, since this in
creases even during the few seconds which the measurement
requires ; but we do obtain the value with which we are
actually concerned in our measurements.
   Tho elements I. and II. were scarcely influenced at all by-
having the circuit closed for half a minute ; but element II.
sank from 1-000 to 0'997, but quickly recovered itself com
pletely. The following changes were caused by more pro
longed closing of the circuit :—

in all cases recovered its former electromotive force.

   The dry Daniell elements have therefore this in common
with Latimer-Clark's element, that they can be prepared once
for all ; but they have further this advantage, that they are
scarcely at all influenced by temperature ; and that an acci
dental closing of the circuit produces only an insignificant
decrease even in elements of small size (about 1 per cent.),
which is very soon recovered. If the electromotive force of a
Daniell element put together with copper, zinc, concentrated
copper-sulphate solution, .and concentrated zinc-sulphate solu
tion be taken as 1*059 volt, then the mean electromotive
force of a dry Daniell element = 1-056. It must, however,
be remembered that the value 1-059 is based upon the assump
tion that the force of a Latimer-Clark element = 1'457 volt,
which estimate is only to be considered as a preliminary one.
   The resistance of element I. was 14,600 ohms, of element II.
13,500 ohms. The strength of current passing through a
short-circuited element is therefore 0'000072 ampere for ele
ment II., and 0"000078 ampere for element III. ; t. e. in the
first 0 08 milligrm. copper would be deposited in the hour, and
with the latter 0-09 millgrm. copper.
   The dry Daniell elements are to be recommended for another
purpose, viz. for charging a quadrant-galvanometer. Zam-
boni's pile has not proved successful for this purpose ; it acts
excellently for a time, but then the potential difference of its
poles changes suddenly, especially with irrogular changes of
temperature. Apparently the deposition of moisture on the
inside of the glass tube containing the pile produces a partial
short-circuiting of the pile. With a water-battery these
sudden changes do not occur, but the difference of potentials
decrease? gradually, if slowly. Errors in measurement cannot
be caused thus; but the deflections of the electrometer become
smaller and smaller, and, apart from the necessity of renew
 ing the evaporated water from time to time, the whole battery
every now and then has to be disconnected and cleaned from
deposits of oxide and carbonate. I found the electromotive
force of a newly prepared zinc and copper element filled with
spring-water to be 0*992 volt. After twelve hours, during
which the element remained open, it had sunk to 0-934 volt.
Three of the elements forming my water-battery, which has
stood now more than a year, were examined. They showed
the following differences of potential :—
      0-838   0 678   0-724 volt        Mean 0-743 volt.
   The dry Daniell elements may conveniently be combined

into a battery which requires no filling, and upon which tem
perature and moisture are without influence.
    Since the resistance of the elements is a matter of indiffer
ence, they may be made very small. I have filled glass tubes,
8 centim. long and 5 millim. diameter, half with the copper-
sulphate plaster and half with the zinc-sulphate plaster, wires
of copper and zinc being placed in the corresponding mixture,
which wires were then soldered together, as shown in the
accompanying figure. The ends of the tubes are closed with
paraffin.
    Twelve such elements form a row.
Twelve such rows stand one behind
the other, each connected with the
preceding one by insulated binding-
screws, so that each chain of twelve
 elements hangs between two binding-
 screws. Any desired number of such
 series of twelve elements may there
 fore be taken to produce the charge.
 The whole battery of 144 elements
 shows a polar difference of potential
 of 152 volts ; whereas the same difference requires 156 ele
 ments of the freshly prepared water-battery and 200 of the
 enfeebled one. The whole dry battery covers a surface of
 16 centim. square.
    Postscript.—In the elements last prepared the zinc wires
 are amalgamated at the ends and covered elsewhere with
 shellac, and the concentrated solutions have been diluted with
 one third of water.

found that these were of little value for my purpose, for
without interpolation it is seldom possible to obtain the
density of solutions of the same strength ; even where it is
so, the determinations were made at different temperatures,
or the density referred to water at different temperatures as
unity. Only in a few cases can these old results be employed
without involving considerable calculation, leading to figures
which are in too many instances evidently erroneous. How
ever, I have arranged in Table I. the apparent molecular
volumes          of some of the more important chlorides, bro
mides, and iodides, calculated by means of the following
formula? from the results of former investigators.

    The agreement is not very good, and in many cases the
 molecular volumes differ considerably from those given by mo
in a subsequent part of this paper ; still they point to an
agreement, which is not complete for the reasons given
above.
    After I commenced this subject, I was much struck by the
fact that water of crystallization has no effect on the molecular
volume of a salt in solution. The case in which I first noticed
it was that of sodium sulphate, which crystallizes with ten
molecules of water.
    Now, if we determine the molecular volume of a solution
which contains two molecules of sodium chloride (an anhydrous
 salt in the solid state) in the 100 molecules of water, and the
 molecular volume of a solution containing one molecule
 (2 equivalents) of sodium sulphate, we find the following: —
                 Mol. vol. Na2Cl2 100 H20 = 1836-3
                   „    „   Na,S04 100 H,0 = 1819-3
                           (Cla-S04), then, =        17-0
and therefore the change in molecular volume produced by
                                  SO
the replacement of CI by               in combination with sodium,
                                   it
i. e.
                        Na(ci-^)=8-5=A;
 for a solution of half the strength,
                        Na(ci-^-4) = 9-2 = A.

1 82          Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the Molecular
   In the case of the similar salts of potassium,
              Mol. vol. K2C1S 100 H20 = 1857-1
                „ „ K2S04 100 HaO = 1840-1
                      (Cl2-SO<), then, =       17-0
and
                       K(ci-^)=8-5=A,
as hefore j in a solution half the strength,
                     K(ci-^4j = 8-9 = A.
So that the difference in A for solutions of the same strength
is nil in the one case and -3 in the other—a difference of ^'oo;
easily produced by the different solubilities (see loc. cit., where
this point is discussed).
   But in the case of the sodium salts an anhydrous one is
compared with a hydrated, while in the case of potassium
neither salt crystallizes with water. It thus appears that
water of crystallization has the same volume as water of
solution. Further evidence is given by the following :—
                   (K-Na)^4         A = 10-39;
while              (K-Na)Cl         A = 1015,
                   (K-Na)NO, A= 10-36,
                   (K-Na)OH A = 10-06,
                   (K-Na)ClO, A = 1056.
   This result, that the presence or absence of water of cry
stallization does not affect the molecular volume in solution,
appeared to me most striking and well worthy of further
investigation. I have therefore noted the number of molecules
of water of crystallization in the salts compared in the follow
ing pages, and it will be found that the above statement is
correct.
   The evidence I have to bring forward in support of my
previous statement with regard to the constancy of molecular
or rather atomic volume exhibited by all elements and groups
of elements, consists of density determinations of nearly
50 salts, representatives of all the important classes from
monatomic up to triatomic acids. My former determinations
are here included, either as they stand or added into the
means. The results are given in one table, as before, for
convenience of reference, and subsidiary tables are formed
from it as occasion requires (Table II.).

   value of (K— Na)ll is 10*4, the extreme variations being
   — •3 and + '6, or, omitting H2P04, as tbe sodium salt was
   not quite pure, we have A = 10"4 + "3, a difference readily-
   produced by the different solubility of the various salts. For,
   as has been shown*, this lias a marked influence, owing to the
   attraction of the salt-molecules for one another. In order to
   avoid this source of error, it would be necessary to work with
   much moro dilute solutions, in which ease the experimental
   errors would be increased ; as it is, I believe that I am fully
  justified in neglecting this difference and in speaking of the
   value of A in sufficiently dilute solutions as a constant : thus
   my former results are fully borne out.

    In all these cases the agreement is satisfactory, the only
                                 Ba
 marked deviation being in -^-(N03 — CI); but it must bo
 remembered that Ba(N03)2 is an exceedingly insoluble salt,
 and the solution in the table is nearly saturated, while the
 BaCl2 solution is not nearly so.
    We come now to the important class of sulphates, of
 which seven are included in Table II. ; and, as before, I have
 taken the difference M^Cl — ~4^.         Table V., which contains
 the figures for the above is divided into two parts : the first
 portion contains those sulphates which either crystallize with

  186          Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the Molecular
  water of crystallization or are anhydrous ; the second those
  which contain water of constitution as well as water of crys
  tallization. It is to be noted that those in the former part
  of the table agree pretty closely, even though the quantities
  of water of crystallization are so very different, and that those
  in the latter part also agree among themselves, but the value
  of A is about 3 units lower.

    Now we have seen that water of crystallization does not
 affect the molecular volume to an extent that can be recog
 nized by experiment ; the cause of this difference in the case
 of the magnesian sulphates must therefore lie, not in the 6 or
 4 molecules of water of crystallization, but in the single
 molecule of water of constitution. From the above experi
 ments it therefore appears probable that water of constitution
 can be recognized when the salt is dissolved ; I say probable,
 for owing to the difficulty experienced in preparing solutions
of these hydrated salts of the exact composition required,
some of them parting with their last molecule of water at a
temperature little below that at which the salt begins to
decompose, the results are not so concordant as in the case of
the other salts.
    There is, however, another method by which this point can
be examined, and one which is totally independent of the
molecular composition of the solutions employed ; it is that
of determining the volume-change on double decomposition.

                  Volumes of Salt-Solutions.                 187
If two reactions take place, each with the formation of a
definite quantity of barium sulphate and the simultaneous
conversion of a corresponding quantity of a sulphate into a
chloride, the volume-change should be the same in each case ;
for, as I have shown above, the volume of the metal or the
acid-radical is the same within narrow limits in whatever way
they are combined. If, however, one of the sulphates involves
water of constitution, and the other not, then, if the results in
Table V. are correct, we should expect to find a difference in
the volume-change.
   I had considerable difficulty in devising a form of apparatus
by means of which this volume-change, on precipitation, coidd
be measured ; after numerous trials I adopted the form given
in fig. 1, and afterwards that in fig. 2.
   The apparatus shown in fig. 1 consists of two tubes, A and B.
A has a capacity of about 50 cubic centim., B about 35 cubic
                             Ksr. 1.
centim. They are connected by a capillary C, as shown, and
the upper ends have capillaries as in a Sprengel tube. In
making an experiment the apparatus is inverted, and some of
the sulphate solution is sucked into B through D—the quantity
to be used has been previously measured from a burette (25
cubic centim.) ; the tube is restored to its upright position,
and D is dried and the whole exactly weighed : then a mea
sured quantity (18 to 20 cubic centim.) of a solution of barium,
chloride of known strength is sucked into A through E, the
air passing through C and up through the contents of B ; the
 tube must be inclined so that the solution passes down the
side of A opposite to C. The apparatus is again exactly
weighed. The difference in weight gives the quantity of
 BaCMa 200 H20 experimented with. E is then washed with a
little water which passes into A, and then paraffin-oil satu
rated with water and of known density is sucked in by E till

188           Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the Molecular
the whole apparatus is filled. It is then placed in the con
 stant-temperature bath, and after some time (iJO minutes) the
 paraffin is drawn oft' to mark F, as in other cases. After
 drying and cooling the whole is weighed; this gives the total
 ¦weight before mixture. Then by suction at E the contents
 of B are transferred in great measure to A, and mixture is
 effected by shaking. The apparatus is then again filled up
 with paraffin ; brought to a constant temperature, dried and
 weighed = total weight after mixture. The difference between
 the last two weights gives the volume-change in grams of
 paraffin of a known density. In this way the volume-change
 on mixture of even dilute solutions can be determined with
 considerable exactness.
    Latterly I employed the apparatus shown in fig. 2, which is
                             Fig. %

more easily used, but requires the aid of a professional glass-
blower in its construction. It, too, consists of two tubes, A
and B, which are joined by the capillary C. E and D are
capillaries ground into A and B respectively. The bend C is
filled with mercury, the liquid in excess introduced into B,
and the whole weighed. Tho other liquid is placed in A and
it is again weighed ; A and B are then filled up with paraffin,
and the capillary stoppers inserted, not to be moved till tho
experiment is completed. The remainder of the operation is
the same as before, mixture being effected by drawing the
liquids b: ckwards and forwards through C. Bather better
results were obtained with this form of apparatus, owing to
the possib'e slight loss on inversion being avoided.
   The advantage of the above method of experiment lies in
the fact that only one solution of exact composition is required;
and if this be employed for all the determinations, any error in

                      Volumes of Salt-Solutions.                     189
it is without influence on the results. Care must, however,
be taken to employ an excess of the other solution ; but as no
appreciable effect is produced by even as much as 6 or 8
cubic centim. of excess, there is no difficulty in this.
   Table VI. gives the results thus obtained. From it, it is
evident the precipitation of one molecule of BaS04 is attended
by the same volume-change so long as the precipitation is
effected by a sulphate which contains no water of constitution,
though it may or may not contain water of crystallization.
When, however, the sulphate contains water of constitution,
then there is less expansion, and the diminution is comparable
with that observed in Table V. Now adding together the

 mean difference in this Table (5-Si) and that obtained in
 Table V. (6-8) wo get 6'35 ; which is as close an approxima
 tion as I can make at present to the difference in molecular
 volume produced by a molecule of water of constitution. It
 is to be noted that this is a + quantity; and if the molecular
 volume of water of solution be 18, then that of water of con
 stitution is 244.
    The accuracy of the experiments on the volume-change by
 the precipitation of BaS04 can bo shown by the following

   The value found by experiment was 43*7 ; just one unit
lower, due to the contraction produced by the dilution of the
2NaCl or 2KC1 solution by the 3600 water set free in the
reaction. The density of BaS04 (solid) was taken as 4-5.
   The above proves most clearly the accuracy of the values
given in Table II., and the justice of my statement that the
volumes of the metals and acid radicals are independent of the
mode of combination. It also appears from the preceding
Tables that the volume occupied by a metal, for instance, is
the same whether it be combined with a monatomic or dia
tomic acid radical. The cause of this may be that in a solu
tion there are ajrcrregations of two or more molecules* : but I
must reserve tbis point for future discussion.
   Further evidence in support of the constancy of the mole
cular or atomic volume is to be found in the results of expe
riments by Ostwaldt, on the volume-change on neutralization
of certain acids, organic and inorganic, by potash, soda, and
ammonia. He found the difference in volume-change between
KHO and NaHO, and between NailO and NH< HO, remained
a practically constant number. His results are given in
Table VII., along with the values I have found for some of
the same reactions. Now since 1 have shown above that the
difference (K — Na)R is constant for H3S04, HC1, and HN03,
it follows that this also holds good for all the salts examined
by Ostwald, and that the molecular volumes of the salt-radicals
are also constant.

192          Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on trie Molecular
knowledge of the constitution of solutions ; that is, we find
that so long as tho acid is a solid crystalline substance, the
value ( H - K) = 1 and ( H - Na) = 1 1'3. But when we have
to do with a liquid or gaseous acid this constancy of difference
disappears ; it reappears, however, when we contrast the
volume of the acid salt with that of the normal.
                KHSO,        ....             =1841-3
                K2S04                         =1840-1

   Thus it is seen that the replacement of the first H in H3 SO<
hy K = 6-4 or Na= — 4-3, while that of the second by K= — 1*2
and by Na= 1 1'3, owing to the change of character of the
sulphuric acid from a liquid dissolved in water to a solid body
dissolved. Where the acid is solid no such difference between
the first and second atoms of hydrogen is to be detected, if we
except the difference 11*7, li'O in the case of the first and
second hydrogen atoms in tartaric acid ; a difference corre
sponding to the difference in heat of neutralization observed
by Thomsen*.
   We have seen that water of constitution in solution occupies
a volume greater than that of water of solution ; but a com
parison of tho sodium phosphates in Table II. shows that the
elements of water in a molecule occupy less volume than water.

                     Volumes of Salt-Solutions.                 193
Thorpe and Watts* have shown that the volume of water of
constitution in the solid state is less than the volume of the
water of crystallization ; so that were the water of crystalli
zation attached to the salt in solution, we should expect to find
a very considerable increase of the molecular volume in solu
tion ; but such is not the case. It is with very great hesita
tion that I venture to suggest that this is a proof that water
of crystallization does not exist in solution ; there is really no
evidence that is conclusive as showing the- opposite. At first
sight the experiments of Thomsent and others, on the heat of
hydration of various salts, lend much support to the view that
water of crystallization does exist, as such, in a solution ; for
there is no doubt that while in very many cases a hydrated
salt dissolves in water with absorption of heat, the same salt
when dehydrated evolves heat on solution. But is it not pos
sible that the act of solution of a dehydrated salt consists, first,
in the taking up of water to form a hydrate ; and that this
hydrate, in dissolving, parts with its water, which thus becomes
indistinguishable from the rest of the water? When a solu
tion, on the other hand, is concentrated, a point is reached at
which the salt is capable of carrying with it a certain number
of water-molecules, and then combination takes place. Some
support of this view is to be found in the fact that it is only
hydrated salts that are capable of forming well-defined super
saturated solutions, and it is only on the supposition that the
molecules of water are not united to the salt that the existence
and density of such solutions can be explained.
   The experiments of Wiillner f on the tensions of salt solu
tions led him to the conclusion that in some cases the water
of crystallization is attached to the salt in solution, in other
cases that it is not; while Riidorff§ and De Coppet|| have
come to conclusions differing from those of Wiillner, but not
agreeing among themselves.
   At this point I must leave this interesting question ; but I
am not without hopes of being able to solve it by experiments
on the vapour-pressures of water from sali>solutions, which I
have already commenced.

XXV. The Periodic Law, and the Occurrence of the Elements
   in Nature. By Thomas Carnelley, JJ.Sc. (London), Pro
  fessor of Chemistry in University College, Dundee*.
§ 1. "DUT few attempts have been made to account for the
       J-* present occurrence of the elements in nature, and
these may be briefly summed up in the statement generally
found in text-books, that some elements, such as gold, pla
tinum, iridium, osmium, &c, always occur in the free state ;
others, such as mercury, silver, oxygen, nitrogen, &c, are
frequently found in this condition ; others, such as lead, tin,
&c, rarely so ; whilst elements such as fluorine, chlorine,
sodium, potassium, &c., are never found but in a state of com
bination. And, further, that metals occur, as a rule, most
commonly in the form of oxides, sulphides, carbonates, and
sulphates.
   § 2. The most interesting of such attempts is that proposed
by Dr. Gladstone (Phil. Mag. [5] iv. p. 379). This, however,
deals rather with the degree of distribution of the elements in
nature than with the form in which they occur. In the paper
referred to, Dr. Gladstone divides the elements into four
classes :—(1) Plentiful, (2) Common, (3) Rare, (4) Very
Hare ; and he shows that the average vapour-density of the
first class is less than that of the second, and the latter less
than that of the third, and this last less than that of the fourth
class. From which be concludes that those elements having
the least vapour-density tended to remain more towards the
surface during the period of the earth's formation, whilst
elements having a high vapour-density accumulated more
towards the centre, and hence occur but rarely on the surface.
   Mendeljeff (Zeitschr.f. Chem. 1869, v. p. 405) has also
pointed out that all those elements which are found in greatest
quantity on the earth's surface have small atomic weights.
The converse of this, however, does not appear to be true; for
lithium, beryllium, and boron are far from occurring in large
quantities.
   § 3. The theory proposed in the present paper, on the other
hand, deals rather with the occurrence than with the distribution
of the elements in nature. It has for its basis the Periodic Law
of the chemical elements, first enunciated by Newlands as the
Law of Octaves, and subsequently and independently deve
loped by Mendeljeff and Lothar Meyer.
   The following is a Table of the Natural Classification of the
Elements in the form adopted by Mendeljeff. This table is

196           Prof. T. Carnelley on the Periodic Law,
now so well known that any further remarks as to its arrange
ment are not required in the present place, except to say that
 in what follows it will be necessary to bear in mind three facts
 in connexion with the table, and which were noticed by Men-
 deljeff in his original paper on the Periodic Law :—
    § 4. (a) That though all the elements in each group are
nearly related to one another, yet those elements belonging to
even series are much more nearly related to one another than
to those of odd series, whilst those belonging to odd series are
much more nearly related to one another than to those of even
series.
   This fact is proved by many chemical relationships which
will at once suggest themselves ; for instance, elements be
longing to even series never, or only rarely, unite with organic
radicals to form methides, ethides, &c., whereas elements of
odd series do so readily. Whilst as regards physical proper
ties I have shown (Deut. chetn. Ges.Ber. xii. p. 1958) that, as
a rule, elements belonging to even series are paramagnetic,
whereas those belonging to odd series are diamagnetic.
   In the table, elements of even series are printed in ordinary
type and those of odd series in thick type.
   § 5. (b) In the case of elements of the second series from
carbon to fluorine, and of the third series from sodium to
silicon inclusive, the rule stated under (a) is frequently re
versed. This fact is rendered evident by an inspection of
Lothar Meyer's curve of the elements (3fod. Theor. Chem.),
in which it is seen that when the curve reaches carbon it rises
until it comes to sodium, instead of continuing to fall, and
thence from sodium to silicon it falls instead of rises. Hence
the curve is exceptional at this part of its course. The ex
ceptional or reversed character of the curve at this point
represents exactly what occurs with many of the other pro
perties of the elements lying within the boundaries indicated
above.
    § 6. (c) Elements belonging to Group VIII. are in many
respects peculiar, due no doubt to their forming the connecting
link between even series on the one hand and odd series on
the other ; so that in some cases (as in their magnetic pro
perties) they resemble the even series, whilst in others (as in
the ease with which they are reduced to the metallic state)
they resemble the odd series.
    It is therefore somewhat uncertain whether the elements of
this group should be placed at the end of the even series or at
the beginning of the odd series. This uncertainty, however,
does not arise in the case of Meyer's curve ; for the position
of these elements on the curve makes it quite evident that they

          and the Occurrence of the Elements in JWature.         197
form the gradual passage from even series to odd series, or
rather from the falling to the rising portions of the curve,
since the elements of this group always form the minima of
the curve.
    § 7. After the above somewhat lengthy but necessary
introduction, we may now proceed to the proper subject of the
paper. This may be divided into three heads:—(1) the redu-
cibility of the elements to the free state from their state of
combination ; (2) occurrence of the elements in the free state
in nature ; (3) occurrence of the elements in the combined
state in nature.
   § 8. (1) Eeducibility of the Elements.— Elements belong
ing to odd series are, as a rule, easily reducible to the free state,
whilst those belonging to even series are only reducible to thefree
state with difficulty.
   The only exceptions to this rule are as follows :—(a) C, N,
0, Na, Mg, Al, and Si, for explanation of which see § 5.
(b) The elements of Group VIII., for which see § 6.
    § 9. (2) OCCURRENCE OF THE.ELEMENTS IN THE FREE STATE
in Nature.—This is, of course, closely connected with the
property of reducibility already considered, so that we may
expect a similar relation to hold good. An inspection of the
Table in fact shows that—
    Elements belonging to even series {except C, N, 0, and
Group VIII.) never occur in the free state in nature ; whereas
elements belonging to odd series generally and sometimes fre
quently do so occur.
    Thus tbe following elements of odd series are frequently
found in the free state:—Cu, Ag, Au, Hg, As, Sb, Bi, S, Se, Te;
 whilst Pb and Sn sometimes occur native. Ga, In, Tl, and
 Cd are distributed so sparsely that we can scarcely say whether
they occur free or not.
    Of elements belonging to odd series which have not been
found free, 01, Br, I, F, Zn, and P are therefore the only
notable exceptions, since Na, Mg, Al, and Si may be accounted
for by § 5.
   As regards the exceptions among even series, C, N, and 0
fall under § 5, and Group VIII. under § 6. It may further be
said in reference to this group, that all the elements belonging
to it except Co occur native ; Fe and Ni, however, only in
meteorites. Of the three sets of triads belonging to this group,
the tendency to occur in the free state increases as the average
atomic weight of each triad increases. Thus the triad Os, It,
Pt are more likely to occur free than the triad Ru, Rh, Pd ;
and the latter more likely than the triad Fe, Co, Ni.

   § 10. (3) Occurrence of the Elements in the Combined
State in Nature.—In reference to what is said under this
section, F, CI, Br, I, and the elements of Group VIII. must
be neglected, as they will be considered further on, §§11, 12.
   Elements belonging to odd series usually occur in nature as
sulphides or double sulphides9, i. e. in combination with a nega
tive element belonging to an odd series, and only in very few
cases as oxides ; whereas elements belonging to even series, on
the other Jiand, usually occur as oxides or double oxides (form
ing silicates, carbonates, sulphates, aluminates, 8fc), i. e. in
combination with a negative element belonging to an even series,
and never (with two exceptions) as sulphides.
   Thus :—
   Elements belonging to Even series :—
                     Commonly. Li (lithia mica, &c.) K (nitre,
                                    felspar, Ac), Rb, Cs, Be, Ca,
                                    Sr, Ba, B, Sc, Y, La, Yb, C, Ti,
  As oxides or
                                    Zr, Ce, Th, V, Nb, Di, Ta, 0,
double oxides.
                                    Cr, Tb, W, Mn.
                    Frequently. N (in nitre), Mo.
                    Rarely or never. None.
 The only two of these elements occurring as sulphides are :—
                  {Commonly. Mo.
                     Very rarely. Mn (also 0, as S0a in volcanic
                       gases).
    Elements belonging to Odd series :—
                     Commonly. Cu, Ag, Zn, Cd, Hg, Ga, In, Tl,
   As sulphides                      Pb, Sb, S, Se, Te.
 (selenides, tel-    Frequently. As, Bi, Sn.
 lurides).           Never.          Au (occurs only in free state in
                                    nature); Na, Mg, Al, Si, P (for
                                    these see § 5).
                     Commonly. Na, Mg, Al, Si, P (for these see
                                     § 5), and Sn.
 As oxides.
                     Frequently. Zn, Cu.
                     Rarely.        Pb, Sb, Bi, As.
    § 11. Group VIII.—The elements of this group, except Fe,
 Co, and Ni, never occur in nature in the combined state, and
 therefore need not be considered in this connexion. As regards
 the first triad of the group,
               * Also as selenides, tellurides, and arsenides.

           and the Occurrence of the Elements in Nature.           199
   Fe occurs mostly as oxide, but also frequently as sulphide;
   Co occurs mostly as sulphide and arsenide, but sometimes as
      oxide;
   Ni occurs almost always as sulphide and arsenide, and only
      very rarely as oxide.
   Iron, the first member of the triad, thus more nearly re
sembles elements of the even series ; whereas nickel, the last
member, more nearly resembles elements of the odd series.
This shows therefore in a marked manner that in Group VIII.
we have a gradual passage from even series on the one hand
to odd series on the other.
   § 12. The halogens CI, Br, I, and F, being the most electro
negative of the elements, occur in nature in combination with
the most electropositive metals as chlorides, bromides, iodides,
and fluorides, &c, and are never (if we omit a few metallic
oxychlorides, and sulphochlorides) found in combination with
either oxygen or sulphur.
   § 13. The only other point necessary to mention is that, as
regards the odd members of any one group, the tendency to
occur in nature as sulphides increases, whereas the tendency
to occur as oxides or double oxides diminishes, as the atomic
weight increases, thus :—
                  'Na*, frequently occurs as double oxide (sili
                       cates, Chili saltpetre &c.) and never as
                       sulphide.
                   Cu, occurs commonly both as sulphide (Cu2S,
    Group I. i        CuS, Cu Fe S2, &c), and as oxide or double
                     oxide (Cu2 0, CuO, malachite, &c).
                   Ag, generally as sulphide and never as oxide.
                   Au, only in free state.
                  'Mg, alwaysoccurs as double oxide (MgC03 &c).
                   Zn, most commonly occurs as sulphide, but
                         sometimes also as oxide.
   Group II.       Cd, only found as sulphide and never as oxide.
                   Hg, only found as sulphide or in metallic state,
                         and never as oxide.
                   Si, always occurs as oxide or double oxide
                        (silicates) .
                   Sn, almost always occurs as oxide, but some
  Group IV.             times as sulphide.
                   Pb, almost always occurs as sulphide, and only
                        rarely as oxide (minium).
 And a similar thing for Groups III., V., and VI.
    * Omitting its occurrence as chloride, since it does not affect the
 present question.

   § 14. The whole of the facts stated above under §§ 8, 9, 10,
11, 12 may be expressed in terms of Lothar Meyer's Curve of
the Elements as follows :—
   Elements standing on falling portions of the curve are redu
cible with difficulty, and never occur in tJie/ree state in nature,
or in combination as sulphides, but always in combination with
oxygen, forming oxides or double oxides {silicates, sulphates,
carbonates, tyc); whereas elements standing on rising portions
of the curve are easily reducible, and almost always occur (more
or less) in the free state in nature, and also in combination with
sulphur, and but rarely with oxygen.
   By stating the relations in this way, almost all the excep
tions mentioned in §§ 8-12 are got rid of and fall in with the
rule.
   This example, with numerous others which might be men
tioned, shows how truly Meyer's Curve of the Elements is an
exact exponent of the facts of nature.
XXVI. Harmonic Motion in Stellar Systems. By Professor
   Pliny E. Chase, Haverford College, Philadelphia, U. S.
   America*.
TJ^HE principle of harmonic motion is of " immense use not
 JL only in ordinary kinetics, hut in the theories of sound,
light, heat, &c." (Thomson and Tait, ' Nat. Phil.' i. sec. 52).
    In studying kinetic correlations, we find that the most
obvious and immediate control is exercised by inertia, attrac
tion, and repulsion. In the solar and stellar systems, the
principles of universal gravitation and of aithereal oscillation
are simultaneously and mutually operative, in ways which are
indicated, as I think, by observable relations among cosmical
masses, distances, velocities, and orbital periods.
    Various forms of cyclical oscillation may be represented
and coordinated by the formula
                    ^=^=7r2L8=M = 2A.
In this formula, g represents gravitating acceleration on an
 oscillating particle ; t— cyclical time of a single oscillation (or
 half-time of rotation or revolution); I — length of linear pen
 dulum, or radius of circular orbital revolution; L = radius of
 free revolution      radius of constrained nucleal rotation, as
 explained in the following paragraph ; M = modulus, or
height of homogeneous elastic atmosphere which would pro-

pagate waves with the velocity gt ; h = height of fall in time t,
or of projection with velocity gt, or of alternate fall and rise
in perpetual elastic rebound with maximum velocity gt. At
Sun's surface, where g is a maximum for our system, and
where the collisions of subsiding particles have changed free
revolution into constrained rotation, gt = the velocity of light.
Therefore, if we designate the velocity of light by v^, and
remember that in an expanding or contracting rotating nucleus
g cc     while t varies as r2, the modulus velocity of aethereal
oscillation, of nucleal rotation, and of limiting gravitating
acceleration, in the solar system has been, is, and will continue
to be v\. Hence we derive the universal equation
which holds for all masses and distances, provided m and r are
expressed in terms of Sun's mass and semidiameter.
    Laplace (Bowditch's translation, III. vii. § 47 [21282])
shows that the solar " atmosphere can extend no further than
 to the orbit of a planet whose periodical revolution is per
 formed in the same time as the sun's rotatory motion about
 its axis." Faye (Comptes Rendus, April 21, 1884, p. 949)
 traces the indication of this limit to Kant. I designate it
 therefore by pK, Sun's semidiameter being p0 and L = p«-T-p0.
 It may be deduced from        as follows:—
    Let tK — time required by a luminous wave to pass from
 Sun to Earth; v0 = limiting velocity of planetary revolution
 at Sun's surface = y/y0p0i vr = velocity of solar equatorial
 rotation. Then, if we take Nyren's estimate of the constant
 of aberration (' The Observatory,' vi. p. 365),
 <x=20"-492 x 31558149^12936000"=4989-99; l}=v^vr;

    ^=687-351 ; L= (687-351 h-tt)? =36-301.
    Bode's law, notwithstanding its failure in the case of Nep
  tune, may perhaps be a partialoxpression of a more extensive
  and more general law. Indeed, within the solar system,
 planetary or belt-positions are nearly represented by the series
 4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, 196, 292, in which there are two

 202              Prof. P. E. Chase on Harmonic
equal intervals at the outer limit as well as two at the inner
limit, and the intermediate positions follow Bode's progression.
 If we determine, by the method of least squares, the law of
planetary progression, we find that it is suggestive of har
monic parabolical subsidence.
    Suppose Sun to be in the focus of a paraboloid of revolution,
with a directrix-plane at tj— and a vertex at =—.          Suppose
the nearest fixed star (presumably a Centauri) to be in the
axis of the same paraboloid. Take 39 numerical abscissas of
the form A„ = f i?"      with A0=£=£, A19=$L, Am = LM-h-
p0=7T2L4. One third of the abscissas (A0..A12) are within
the solar photosphere ; one third (A13 . . A25) are extra-solar
and inter-asteroidal ; one third (A2g . . A38) are extra- asteroidal
and inter-stellar. The next abscissa (A39) is in a region of
predominating stellar influence, approximately, and perhaps
exactly, in the locus of a Centauri. The twenty-seven extra-
solar and inter-stellar abscissas may also be divided into three
equal suggestive groups, A12 . . A20 being inter-planetary ;
A21 . . A28 having significant planetary relations ; A30 . . A3S
being extra-planetary. The middle group (A21 . . A29) repre
sent, respectively, £ Mercury, ^ Venus, § Earth, £ Mars,
$ asteroid, § Jupiter, f Saturn, ^ Uranus, £ Neptune, the            i
indicated loci being all within orbital limits. We find here,
as in the Bodeian series, two equal numerators at the outer
limit, where the harmonic mean of the two coefficients is unity,
as well as two at the inner limit, where the harmonic mean is \.
The coefficients     §, &c. represent successive and progressive
harmonic rupturing tendencies, inasmuch as particles falling
toward a cosmic focus from a distance nr would acquire the
dissociative velocity \/ 2gr at       r- The reciprocal character
of the Saturnian and Neptunian coefficients furnishes an indi
cation of such retrograde tendencies as we may naturally look
for at the outer limits of a planetary system.
   Although it is impossible at present to anticipate with
certainty the precise way in which undiscovered harmonic
influences will be manifested, it may be possible to show the
probable existence of such influences and where to look for
them. The tendency to make absolute any close approxima
tion to simple numerical relations, which is found in Jupiter's
satellites, should likewise prevail in planetary motions. The
number of such tendencies among the cosmical masses and
positions is so great that it is difficult, for want of definite
criteria, to judge of their relative importance. It may perhaps

                     Motion in Stellar Systems.                 203
finally be found that they are all satisfied by adjustments of
orbital eccentricity.
    In seeking illustrations and estimating the relative import
ance of the harmonic adjustments of cosmical masses, we may
be guided by the following considerations :—
    1. Sun (wio) is the chief centre of nucleation.
    2. Eartb (m3) is the chief centre of condensation, since it
is the largest of the dense planets, and its orbit traverses the
secular centre of the belt of greatest condensation.
    3. Jupiter (m5) is the chief centre of planetary nebulosity,
since it is the largest planet, and its orbit traverses the centre
of the planetary system when Neptune and Uranus are in
opposition.
    4. Saturn (m6) is the centre of nebular planetary inertia,
since vSww^-i-Swi is in Saturn's orbit.
    The harmonic relation of solar gravitation to the velocity of
light appears to have exerted a secondary influence at the
 chief centre of condensation, for we find
         ffs • 9o+93 ¦ ¦ (vK-*-9o=to) ¦ (;r + ~ =1 year).
 The mass-ratio which satisfies this proportion iswi0 = 327400wi3.
    A combination of the harmonic influences of the chief
 centres of nucleation, condensation, and nebulosity seems to
 be shown by Earth's and Jupiter's modulus-velocities of rota
 tion ; since g%h= circular-orbital velocity at the mean centre
 of gravity of O and % , while g6tB = circular orbital velocity
 at Sun's surface. The equation which satisfies these har
 monics is »n0= 1054*6 m8.
     The total vis viva of gravitating subsidence in equal sethereal
 spheres, which varies as m3, seems to have cooperated with
 luminous undulation in determining the ratio of the two great
  planetary masses, at the centres of nebulosity and of planetary
 inertia. The proportion m\ : m\ : : pK : p0 gives m0=3491,87ng.
     The mass of the exterior belt seems to have been mainly
  determined by simple oscillatory relations to the chief centre
  of nebulosity, and the subdivisions of the belt by vis viva of
  subsidence, as appears by the equations
                           •7r2(»7ig + m7)=jn8,
  which give wi0= 22497 m7 ; m0= 19370 wig.
     The ratio of Venus to Earth appears to be such as to give
  the two planets equal orbital momenta. This harmony would
  be satisfied by the equation 7«o'= 384962 ms.

204                 Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on
    The outer masses of the belt of greatest condensation are
perhaps connected with the inner masses, by the same rela
tions as exist between the outer belt of the system and the
chief centre of nebulosity.
These harmonics give m0=4503361wi1 = 2852190m4.
    The accordance of the foregoing harmonic values with recent
astronomical estimates is shown in the following Table:—

                 XXVII. A priori Probabilities.
  By F. Y. Edgeworth, Lecturer on Logic at King's College*.
 I.   A PRIORI probabilities not determined by statistics
          underlie many important calculations both in Physics
 and Social Science. (1) In the measurement of a physical
 quantity it is generally assumed that, prior to observation, one
 value of the quaesituin is as likely as another. Take, for ex
ample, the followingt simple problem:—Given a set of obser
vations in a line, x1} xi} x3, diverging according to a given
probability-curve from a sought point x. x is found from the
equation
             4 pH-L e-*»{(x-*l)»+(x-x2)>+&c.} = ()
where p is the a priori probability that the real value of the
quassitum is between x and x + Ax. It is generally assumed
that p is constant. But if not, let it equal Ax%(x), where Ax
is an indefinitely small constant. Then the equation
               2A2x {(x-x1) + (x-xa) + &c.}=0

will have to be modified by adding to the left-hand member
the term *            Again, in the problem* which may be placed
next to the above in point of simplicity, viz. given a set of
observations diverging from a known point according to a
sought modulus, it nas been tacitly assumed that, a priori, one
value of the modulus is as likely as another. But, if it is not
so, let v(A)AA express the distribution of a priori probability.
Then the equation to zero, from which the reciprocal of the
modulus squared is found to be half the reciprocal of the
mean square of error, will have to be modified by adding to
the left-hand member the term
A fortiori in the problems compounded of those simple cases ;
in particular those which we distinguished in a former paperf
as Probs. III. and IV. And if we ascend to the higher pro-
blemsf, which are not restricted to exponential laws of error,
and to the more sublime qua?situm of utility as distinguished
from probability, there also does the necessity of an a prion
foundation confront us. A priori also is the basis of the im
portant theorem which determines the probability that two
sets of observations have diverged from different means.
   (2) The preceding remarks relate primarily to the measure
ment of objective continuous quantities, real spaces and times
—for instance, a star's position in the heavenly sphere, or its
time of crossing the meridian. What is true of this class of
measurables is true, mutatis mutandis, in the case of integer
numbers, and of the Means which have been called subjective,
fictitious, or typical. An example of a real integer number
estimated by a sort of method of observation, is Jevons's§
calculation of the number of sovereigns in currency. Ex
amples of the fictitious Mean are :—in space an average group
of barometrical heights, in time the average flowering-time of
a plant, in integer number all the Registrar-General's returns.
We are not now concerned to examine the distinctions which
have just been indicated. For the present purpose we may
compare with the first problem of the preceding paragraph
the statistical practice of taking the mean of a large number
of figures. The analogues in integer number of the problems
in continuous quantity which involve the determination of a
modulus are less familiar. Statistical examples resembling

 206                    Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on
 the problem intermediate* between our III. and IV. will be
 found in Hain's Staiistik des Oesterreichischen Kaiserstaates. In
 so far as these methods are applications of Inverse Probabi
 lities they involve a priori assumptions'!-. And the theorem
 which assigns the probability that the difference between two
 sets of statistics^ (e. g. male and female births) is not acci
  dental is similarly founded on an a priori basis.
      (3) In examining the foundations of some of the problems
 mentioned we shall find a still lower depth of a priori proba
 bility. In calculating a posteriori the probability that two
  sets of observations or statistics result from different Means
  (whether of the real or the fictitious species), we seem to make
 some assumption as to the probability that the two means
  should be identical. And generally, in calculating a posteriori
  the probability that a certain phenomenon is not the result of
  chance §, we make some assumption as to the a priori proba
  bility that the regime of chance§ existed. This is pointed out
  by Boole and Donkin in several brilliant papers || which ap
  peared in this Journal. It seems impossible to deny that,
  with respect to these a priori probabilities, the theory of Boole
  and Donkin is more correct than the practice of LaplaceH and
  Herschel.
      (4) Thus the Calculus of probabilities, as applied to the
 most important problems, requires a priori data. It may,
 however, be denied that those problems require the calculus
 for their solution. It may be plausibly maintained that the
 effective inference is not of the nature of Inverse Probability,
 but ordinary Induction. When we conclude that the ratio of
 male to female births is (say) 104 : 100, we need not calculate
 inversely the probability that the given statistics would have
    • Phil. Mag. 1883, vol. xvi.
    t This remark extends of course to the so-called Law of Succession,
 which may be regarded Ha a deduction (by way of Bemouilli's theorem)
 from one of the inverse theorems contemplated in this paragraph. The
 analogue in observations of this descent after ascent is given at p. 374,
 Phil. Mag. 1883, vol. xvi.
     % The line between " observations'' and "statistics" may thus perhaps
 be drawn : the formor is concerned with real, the latter with fictitious,
 Means. Or, less philosophically perhaps (transferring to " Statistics " an
 inquiry, like Jevons's above indicated, as to a real integer number), they
 are distinguished from each other, as are the subjects of our first and
 second paragraphs. The complaints which have been made by previous
 writers (Cournot, Ellis, and Mr. Venn) against Inverse Probability do not
 seem to have included the case of Observations in the narrower sense of
 the term : real Means in continuous quantity.

resulted from any other mean. It suffices to infer inductively
that, because groups of statistics having that ratio as mean
have been in great numbers presented in the past, such groups
will be reproduced in the future ; then to take the Mean as
the representative of the group ; by the light of common
sense, or according to a more formal principle to be set forth
hereafter. The case of observations and statistics of different
weight presents indeed a difficulty, but not perhaps an insu
perable one, in the way of this procedure. Although the
objection seems to have a good deal of force, yet it cannot
reasonably be allowed to dispense altogether with the Calculus.
At least in cases where our data are not indefinitely numerous
we must apply a stroke of inverse probability. And even in
cases more favourable to unaided induction, though without the
calculus we might be confident that a discrepancy in statistics
corresponded to a difference of cause (for example, in the case
of male compared with female births), yet could we have an
adequate conception of the degree of that assurance without
the mathematical calculations of a Laplace ? In fine, is any
one competent to assert that those reasonings of the greatest
intellects * should be put into the fire ?
    II. If, then, a priori probabilities are required, it behoves
us to consider how far that requirement is fulfilled.
    (1) It is fulfilled sufficiently to allow of a mathematical,
though not a numerical, inference in cases where the aposteriori
probability has a limiting value, provided that an involved
a priori probability is not extreme. For example, in the first
problem of our first paragraph, when n is indefinitely large,
we may neglect the correction introduced, provided that
is finite ; which seems to be in general reasonably certain.
And similarly in the second problem, and subject to a similar
proviso, the correction in comparison with the term corrected
is neglectible when n is indefinitely large. The remark ex
tends to the problem intermediate between III. and IV. It
extends also to the important theorem which assigns the
probability that a difference in observations or statistics cor
responds to a difference in cause. This is well indicated by
Coumot (with regard to statistics at least), though he hardly
seems aware that his formula connecting the extent of error
and the probability of its occurrencet has no numerical validity
upon his view of a priori probabilities. Again, the indeter-

  208                      Mr. F. Y. Edgeworth on
  minate constants introduced by Boole and Donkin into the
  expression for a posteriori probabilities do not refuse a quan
  titative though not numerical conclusion ; provided that we
  know something of those a priori probabilities : that they are
  not extremely great or small*. Since, indeed, these constants
  are of a somewhat faineant character, and have at most a veto
  on the conclusion, there seems a good deal to be said (beyond
  what has been said by Boole and Donkinf) in favour of the prac
  tice of Laplace and Herschel and other high authorities, who
  omit these constants in their estimateof aposteriori probability.
  Only it must be remembered that such measures are not of
  the exacter species contemplated by Herschelf and DeMorgan§,
  but rather like economic measures of utility, not proportional
 to the thing measured, but increasing with its increase and
 decreasing with its decrease in general and in the absence of
 extraordinary circumstances.
      (2) If greater precision is desiderated, may we postulate that
 the measurables in our first two paragraphs and the constants
 representing probability in our third paragraph do as often
 have one value as another (of all the values which they can
 possibly have, or at least over a certain range of those values).
 Such a postulate is based by the present writer || upon a sort
 of unconscious induction; like that upon the strength of which
it has been believed (correctly, as more definite experience
 shows) that one digit in general recurs as often as another.
 This position is not exposed to Boole's remarkU upon apriori
 probability, which Mrs. Bryant** has lately roinforced. They
 seem to fire altogether above our humble empirical ground.
 But it may be well to show that, as we are not aimed at, so
 neither are we hit, Boole, objecting to the assumption that
a priori one value of a probability-constant is as likely as
another, propounds a counter hypothesis according to which
a priori probabilities are no longer evenly distributed, but
crowded together in the neighbourhood of the value ^. The
 reply is ft that the hypothesis does not agree with fact, that
experience (e.g. the Kegistrar-General's returns) presents a
great variety of statistical ratios, and no decided preponder
ance of the ratio            Mrs. Bryant follows, objecting " that if
 all frequencies of the event Y are equally probable, the fre
quencies of the event which consists in a Y following a Y are

not equally probable. The hypothesis is thus shown to be
inconsistent, since it cannot be applied to these two unknown
events of Y and Y repeated." Of course it must be admitted
that, if a certain variable has as often one value as another, a
second variable depending upon the first may not enjoy that
equal distribution of values. If the stars are distributed at
random over the heavenly sphere, then the distance between
a star and its nearest neighbour will not have one value as
often as another. Very great and small distances will be
rare. If cannon-balls be fired with constant velocity from a
cannon which is directed at random to any point on a sphere
described about the turning-point as centre, the balls descend
ing will not strew the earth uniformly like snow. And, to
come to the point, if the probability p of an occurrence X
is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, then the probability
P of the double event as, x will not be distributed uniformly,
but according to this law: that the probability of the a priori
probability being between P and P + AP is (not AP) but Ap,
that is in the limit AP^p, that is AP £^p> since P=p2.
Which seems contrary to experience.
   (3) Let it be granted, however, that Boole and his fol
lowers hit a weak point if they suggest that, though some
thing in each class of phenomena occurs as often one way as
another, it is not always possible to determine what it is which
is thus equally distributed, whether our cannon is aimed indif
ferently in every direction, or our cannon-balls fall uni
formly like snow. Still we may fall back upon the position
that, where the form of a function is completely unknown, it
is allowable to assume that form which is most convenient for
the purpose of calculation (especially where we have reason
to suppose that the results of different hypotheses are not
widely different). It is upon this principle that Laplace took
the first step in his celebrated method of Least Squares,
assuming that the qua;situm is an arithmetic mean of the ob
 servations. If, indeed, the views put forward in a former
paper in this Journal are correct, that step is by no means so
precarious as has been supposed. Still that Laplace should
have taken that step in the dark and that it should turn out
 to be correct is very instructive. The same principle must
be employed in the determination* of a change in the general
 purchasing power of gold, and probably in many other parts
 of Social Science. The principle seems especially appropriate
to cases where we seek, not so much an exact measurement, as
                   * ' Statistical Journal,' Jan. 1884:

 210        Prof. J. Dewar on the Liquefaction of Oxygen
 the order of the probability which attaches to an hypothesis.
 Accordingly the principle affords a foundation for Donkin's"
 elaborate calculation of the probability of a physical connexion
 between binary stars. However, it may be admitted that his
 assumption concerning the genesis of double stars, though
 doubtless the simplest that could be made, yet does not
 exceed rival assumptions in respect of simplicity and conve
 nience to the same extent as the assumption of an arithmetic
 mean in the cases just referred to excels the geometric and
 all other means.
    To sum up, there has been expressed a doubt [I. (4)] how
 far the area of applied Inverse Probabilities extends. But, as
 far as it does extend, so far, in general and with the trifling ex
 ception of games of chance [I. (l)-(3)], a foundation of unsta-
 tistical a priori probabilities is required. The only perfectly
 solid foundation of this character which exists is, as it were,
 a shapeless mass of rough experience [II. (1)] adequate to
 support an unnumerical a posteriori probability. To afford a
 basis for the more regular structures of the science that rude
 foundation must be levelled by the addition [II. (2)] of a
 somewhat less solid, but still empirical, material. And after
 all [II. (3)] there remain fissures to be filled up by legiti
 mate conjecture. How much such a foundation will support,
to what height it is expedient to carry an arithmetical calcu
lation founded thereon, is a question to be determined by that
unwritten philosophy and undefinable good sense which, in the
order of scientific method, precedes the application of Calculus
and is prior to a priori probabilities.
XXVIII. On the Liquefaction of Oxygen and the Critical
    Volumes of Fluids. By James Dewar, M.A., F.R.S.,
    Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution, tyc. f
HAVING had occasion to illustrate, in my lectures at the
          Royal Institution, the liquefaction of oxygen, a short
description of the apparatus I have found most convenient for
such demonstration may interest the readers of the Philoso-
{)hical Magazine. The two Russian chemists MM. Wrob-
  ewski and Olzewski, who have recently made such a
splendid success in the production and maintenance of low
temperature, have used in their researches an enlarged form of
the well-known Cailletet apparatus ; but for the purposes of
lecture demonstration, which necessarily involves the projection
on a screen of the actions taking place, the apparatus repre-

               and the Critical Volumes ofLiquids.           211
sented in the annexed woodcut is more readily and quickly
handled, and enables comparatively large quantities of liquid
oxygen to be produced. The arrangements will be at once
understood on looking at the figure, which is taken from a
photograph. The oxygen- or air-reservoir, C, is mado of iron ;
it contains gas compressed for convenience to 150 atmospheres.
 A is the stopcock for regulating the pressure of the gas in the
 glass tube F, and D is the pressure-manometer, the fine copper
tube which connects the gas-reservoir and the glass tube, F,
being shown at I. The air-pump gauge is marked J, the
tube leading to the double oscillating Bianchi being attached
at H. The glass test-tube G, which contains the liquid ethy
lene, solid carbonic acid, or liquid nitrous oxide, which is to
be boiled in vacuo, is placed in the middle of a larger tube. It
has holes, shown at E, in the upper part, so that the cool va
pours in their course to the air-pump are forced to pass round
the outside of the vessel and help to guard it from external
radiation. The lower part of the outer cylinder is covered
with pieces of chloride of calcium, shown at K. If a thermo
meter is used and a continuous supply of ethylene maintained,
the india-rubber cork through which the tube F passes has
two additional apertures for the purpose of inserting the

212        Prof. J. Dewar on the Liquefaction of Oxygen
respective tubes. When the pnmp has reduced the pressure
to 25 mm., the ethylene has a temperature of about
— 140° C; a pressure of between 20 and 30 atmospheres
is then sufficient to produce liquid oxygen in the tube F.
The tube F is 5 mm. in diameter and about 3 mm. thick in
the walls, and when filled with fluid oxygen (for projection)
holds at least 1"5 cubic centim. With such a quantity of
fluid oxygen it is easy to show its ebullition at ordinary pres
sures, and by means of a thermo-junetion to demonstrate the
 great reduction of temperature which is attendant on its
change of state at atmospheric pressure.
    Provided a supply of liquid ethylene can be had, there is no
difficulty in repeating all the experiments of the Russian obser
vers ; but as this gas is troublesome to make in quantity, and
cannot be bought like carbonic acid or nitrous oxide, such expe
riments necessitate a considerable sacrifice of time. It was
therefore with considerable satisfaction that I observed the pro
duction of liquid oxygen by the use of solid carbonic acid, or
preferably liquid nitrous oxide. When these substances are
employed and the pressure is reduced to about 25 mm., the tem
perature of — 115 C. may be taken as that of the carbonic acid,
and —125° C. as that of the nitrous oxide. As the critical
 point of oxygen, according to the Russian observers, is
 about —113° C, both these cooling agents may be said to
 lower the temperature sufficiently to produce liquid oxygen,
 provided a pressure of the gas above the critical pressure,
 which is 50 atmospheres, is at command. In any case, how
 ever, the temperature is near that of the critical point ; and
 as it is difficult to maintain the pressure below about an inch
 of mercury, the temperature is apt to be rather above the
 respective temperatures of — 115°C. and — 125°C. In order
 to get liquefaction conveniently with either of these agents, it
 is necessary to work at a pressure of oxygen gas from 80 to
 100 atmospheres, and to have the means of producing a
 sudden expansion when the compressed gas is cooled to the
 above-mentioned temperatures. This is brought about by the
 use of an additional stopcock, represented in the figure at B.
 During the expansion the stopcock at A is closed and the pres
 sure-manometer carefully observed. No doubt liquid nitrous
 oxide is the most convenient substance to use as a cooling agent;
 but as it is apt to get superheated during the reduction of
 pressure and boil over with explosive bursts of vapour, it is well
 to collect the fluid in a small flask of about 250 cub. centim.
 capacity, and to chnnge it into the solid state by connecting
 the flask with the air-pump, and then to use the substance in
 this form. The addition of alcohol or ether to the solid nitrous

               and the Critical Volumes of Liquids.                 213
oxide makes the body more transparent, and thereby favours
the observations.
    It is evident that this apparatus enables the observer to
determine the density of the fluid gases condensed in the
tube F ; since he has only to measure the volume of fluid
in F, and to collect, by means of the stopcock B, the whole
volume of gas given by the fluid and condensed vapour, which
gives an accurate determination of the total weight of substance
distributed between fluid and vapour in the whole apparatus.
The amount of substance which is required to produce the
vapour is easily found by observing the vapour-pressure of the
liquid gas before expanding it into gas for the volume mea
surement ; and while keeping shut the stopcock B, by opening
A suddenly until this pressure is just reached and then instantly
shutting ofF the receiver. If this volume of gas is now mea
sured by opening B as before, the difference between the two
volumes thus collected will correspond to the real weight of
substance in the liquid state. A rough experiment with
oxygen near the critical point gave the density 0-65.
    As to the most convenient substance for use as a cooling
agent, I am still of opinion that marsh-gas would be the best;
and I may take the opportunity of pointing out that the em
ployment of this body was suggested by me in a communi
cation made to the Chemical Section of the British Association
in 1883. The following extract from ' Nature,' of October 4,
 1883, will prove that my experiments with liquid marsh-gas
 were made a year in advance of those made recently by M.
 Cailletet * and M. Wroblewskif:—
     " Professor Dewar pointed out an important relation
between the critical temperatures and pressures of volatile
liquids and their molecular volumes. The ratio of the critical
temperature to the critical pressure is proportional to the
 molecular volume, so that the determination of the critical
 temperature and pressure of a substance gives us a perfectly
 independent measure of the molecular volumes. Prof. Dewar
pointed out the great advantage of employing a liquid of low
 critical temperature and pressure such as liquid marsh-gas for
 producing exceedingly low temperature. He hoped to be able
to approach the absolute zero by the evaporation of liquefied
 marsh-gas whose critical temperature was less than — 100° C,
 and whose critical pressure was only 39 atmospheres."
     I ought to mention that the marsh-gas used in my experi-

    A glance at the last column of the table shows that a large
number of substances have at their respective critical tem
peratures simple volume relations. Thus hydrochloric acid,
water, ammonia, and marsh-gas, the four chemical substances
from which the great majority of chemical compounds may
be derived by processes of substitution, have nearly the
same volume ; while the more complex derivatives show an
increased volume which bears a simple ratio to that of the
typical body. As the critical pressures are not known with
any great accuracy at present, it would be useless to discuss
the results with any severity. All that can be inferred is
that the subject is worthy of further investigation and pro
mises important generalization. Sarrau (Compt. Bend. 1882)
deduced the critical temperatures and pressures of hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen by the application of Clausius' formula
to the experiments ofAmagat; and it is interesting to compare
his results with the experimental values.

   It will be observed that the calculated critical temperatures
of oxygen and nitrogen are remarkably near the truth, being
respectively 8° and 22° too high. On the other hand, the
values of the ratios of the calculated critical temperatures and
pressures are almost identical with those obtained by direct
experiment. The only peculiarity to be noted is in the case
of hydrogen, which has such a high critical pressure, and
therefore leads to a remarkably small molecular volume at
the critical point. If the values of the T-r-P ratio be taken
as proportional to the molecular volumes, then it is easy to
infer the densities of the fluids at their respective critical tem
peratures, provided the density of one standard substance is
known by experiment. The simple formula thus stated is
where S and S' are the specific gravities of two bodies, W
and W their molecular weights, and V and V' their molecular
volumes. It will be convenient to take the density of car
bonic acid at the critical point as the standard density to
which the others can be referred. The density of carbonic
acid under such conditions maybe taken as 065. Calculating
with the above formula, the density of acetylene would be
032, whereas the experimental number of Ansdell is 0"36.
In the same way the density of hydrochloric acid is found to
be 0*6, the true value being 0 61. The density of oxygen
would be 0"63, and that of nitrogen 0*45. The calculated
density of hydrogen at its critical point would be 0*12, if we
assume the correctness of Sarrau's values for the critical tem
perature and pressure. We may compare these values with
the numbers obtained by Cailletet and Hautefeuille for the
densities of oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen from their expe
riments on the density of liquid carbonic acid obtained
from mixtures of this body with these gases. At the tempera
ture of 0° C. the experiments found for oxygen, nitrogen, and
hydrogen the respective values of 0'65, 0-37, and 0 025. It

                       Mr. C. V. Boys on a
seems that the calculated values for oxygen and nitrogen
are not very far wrong ; but hydrogen is clearly incorrect.
The explanation of this anomaly is probably to be found in
the fact that the calculated molecular volume of hydrogen is
 wrong, and that instead of being unity on our scale it ought
 to be 3*5 like oxygen and nitrogen. In fact, the chemist
would infer that, as the difference in the complexity of the
molecular structure of hydrochloric acid, water, ammonia, and
marsh-gas does not affect the molecular volume under the
 conditions we are discussing, in all probability the value for
hydrogen would be identical with that of the above-mentioned
bodies. If we adopt this view and change the value of the
Te-i-Pc to 35, then the density of the fluid would become
0"034, which is in accordance with the experimental number
 of Cailletet and Hautefeuille. An accurate determination of
the critical temperature and pressure of hydrogen, for which,
judging from the success of the experiments of M. Olzewski,
chemists will not have to wait long, will thus be of great
interest.
XXIX. A Magneto-electric Phenomenon. By C. V. Boys,
   A.R.S.M., Demonstrator of Physics at the Science Schools,
   South Kensington* .
EVERY one is familiar with the effect produced when a
        copper disk is set to spin in a powerful magnetic field :
the currents induced by the motion of the disk act in such a
direction as to oppose the motion, which therefore speedily
ceases. Faraday observed that if, instead of being set to spin,
a disk is merely suspended between the poles of an electro
magnet, it will in general be disturbed whenever the current in
the coils of the electromagnet is made or broken. If it lie with
its plane parallel or at right angles to the lines of force, no
disturbance will be apparent if the lines of force where they
are included by the disk are parallel. But if the plane of the
disk makes an angle a with the parallel lines of force, then on
making the current in the electromagnet an impulse is given
tending to diminish the angle o, while breaking the current
gives an impulse tending to increase the angle a.
   Again, if the angle a be 90°, so as to eliminate this twisting
effect, no movement will be visible at the making or the break
ing in a parallel field ; but if the disk be placed in a field with
diverging lines of force, in which, of course, the strength
diminishes as the lines separate, and if it be placed symme
trically so as to include the greatest number (i. e. with its

plane at right angles to those lines passing through its centre),
then, on making the current, it will receive an impulse causing
it to move parallel to itself along the lines of force towards
the weaker part of the field, and at the breaking it will receive
an impulse more evident in the opposite direction. • If this
radiating field is produced between a pointed and a flat pole,
the disk will, on making the current, appear to be repelled
from, and, on breaking, to be attracted by, the pointed pole.
So powerful is this effect that a piece of impure copper, which
is strongly magnetic, is repelled from the pointed pole on
making, and attracted on breaking, the current, thus appearing
at first sight strongly diamagnetic.
   Though these impulses must have been observed by most
experimentalists, their amount has not been, so far as I am
aware, determined in absolute units, nor have they been turned
to account for making any measurements. As they seem to
afford one of the most convenient methods of determining
conductivity and field-intensity, perhaps a short paper on the
subject, even though it bo incomplete, may be of interest to
this Society.
   The explanation of the motions described will be obvious,
but it may be well to give it at length for the sako of arriving
at quantitative results. In the first place, let the lines of force
be parallel, so that the field is of uniform strength. Let a
ring of (small) section s, of specific resistance p, and of radius r,
be placed in the field, with its plane making an angle a with
the lines of force. Let the strength of the field be H units.
Then during a small increment of field-intensity rfH, in the
time dt, a current will be induced in the ring of the strength
                            rs sin a dH
                               2p ~dt'
This current in the field H will produce a twisting tendency
to increase a with a diminishing, or to diminish a with an
increasing field, represented by the couple
                         irr3 sH sin 2« dH.
                               4p         W
From this it is clear that the couple varies inversely as the
time dt occupied in making any small change of field-intensity
dH, but it lasts for the time dt ; therefore the momentum
acquired by the suspended disk, if free to move, will be inde
pendent of the rate at which any small change in the magnetic
field may be made, but will depend only on its amount, pro
vided that the time is not sufficient for the angle a to have
perceptibly altered during the change. Since this is true of
any element, it is true of all; so the momentum acquired by

 218                    Mr. C. V. Boys on a
 the ring is a direct measure of any total change in the strength
 of the field in which it lies, no matter by what law it changes
 in strength. If at the end of any rapid chang9 the field
 remains of any strength, the motion of the ring will be rapidly
 stopped by the well-known damping action, of which I shall
 have more to say later. If, however, the field sinks to zero,
 or nearly so, the momentum acquired can be measured and the
 original intensity determined.
   The current induced in the ring will of course react on the
field and bend the lines of force in such a manner as to hinder
their passing through its edge, that is to delay the change of
included field-intensity ; but the impulse is independent of
the time or the manner in which the field changes, so it can
not be effected to any extent by this cause.
   Since the impulse given to the disk during any element of
time is
                      _irr3sR sin 2* dR
                               4p         dt'
the total impulse while H changes between 0 and H will be
                         _Trr3.vH2sin 2*
If the moment of inertia of the disk be M, and the torsional
value of the supporting wire be T, the angular velocity w
generated will be

   The action on a disk may be considered as the sum of the
actions on the several elementary rings of which it is com
posed, for there cannot be any tendency for any part of the
currents to cross over the elementary circles. The impulse
therefore on a disk of radius r and thickness s will be
                            •77T4sH2 sin 2<x
                                  32•Pr

of radius rj will be

Since the moment of inertia of a disk is also proportional to
the fourth power and to the thickness, so long as the thickness
is small, it will appear that the velocity imparted to a disk of
any size or thickness, or to a ring, during a change in a mag
netic field will be the same. To what extent a correction
should bo applied to these results for self-induction between
different parts of the disk I am not prepared to say ; their
calculation would give trouble.
   For comparing one field with another, disks or rings of
metal may be used ; but for absolute measurements, as it
would be impossible to measure the exact conductivity of a
disk, a coil is preferable. By employing disks of different
metals their conductivities can be compared without the
trouble of drawing into wire or cutting into long strips.
    It will be found that a coil of area A and resistance R will,
under a torsion T, experience a throw

    If, instead of a disk, a sphere be used, no twisting should bo
 experienced if the conductivity in different directions is the
 same. If, however, there is a plane of greatest or least con
 ductivity, it should be possible to discover it. Crystallization
 or mechanical treatment might give rise to such planes in
 metals; no definite results could bo expected in any thing else.
    I have referred to the apparent repulsion and attraction of
 a disk of metal by a pointed pole at the making and breaking
 of the magnetizing current. As the lines from such a pole
 radiate outwards, they are not normal to the metal except in
 the middle. On their passage inwards or outwards they give
 rise to circular currents tending to move each part of the disk
 normally to the lines of force. There is therefore a longitu
 dinal component away from the point of radiation during an
 increase in the field, and towards it during a diminution of the
 field. A closed coil of wire is subject to the same forces. If a
 coil be made of uncovered copper wire in the form of a double
 helix with the ends joined together, and if the convolutions
 are separate so as nowhere to touch one another, the growth
 of the magnetic field can be watched by placing the coil nearly
 over one pole. On making the current the field begins to
 grow, at first quickly and afterwards more slowly. The coil
 will receive a push and will extend itself. As the push
 diminishes in amount, owing to the diminishing rate of growth
 of the magnetic field, the coil will gradually regain its former
 shape. It might be thought that the slow recoil is simply due
 to the damping action of the field ; but this is not sufficient

220                    Mr. C. V. Boys on a
to account for it, as when the field is fully grown the coil will,
on being forcibly drawn out, recover its shape much more
quickly. On breaking the magnetizing current, the impulse
in the opposite direction, being the same as before but lasting
for so much shorter a time, is far more evident.
   My first experiments were made with a view to determine
whether the impulse was proportional to sin 2« when other
things remained the same. I therefore cemented a disk of
metal (a half-crown) to an ebonite rod carrying a glass index
and hung by a torsion-wire of platinum. The glass index
travelled ovor a card divided into degrees ; and the wire to
which the upper end of the torsion-wire was soldered also
carried a pointer, the position of which could, if desired, be
read on a divided card. The disk was suspended between two
parallel polar faces of iron. The upper index was turned until,
on making and breaking the current, the lower index showed
no sign of motion. It could thus be placed within a small
fraction of a degree, so that « was either 90° or 0°. The lower
card was then adjusted, and the upper index turned so that
the lower rested successively at 5°, 10°, 15°, &c. up to 90°.
The negative impulse on making, and the positive impulse
on breaking, the current were observed by the throw of
the lower index. These are given in the second and third
columns of the following Table. In the fourth column is
a series of numbers in the proportion of sin 2a, the largest
number being made to agree with the observed positive throw.

                Magneto-electric Phenomenon.                 221
that, on breaking the circuit, the impulse is truly proportional
to sin 2a. Examination shows that the negative impulses,
though in reality equal to the others, are apparently much less--
in amount, that they are not even in proportion, and not only
this, but that the corresponding values on either side of 45° are
not the same. This want of symmetry is clearly shown by
fig. 1. The discrepancy is due to the fact that the disk is
brought to rest by the damping action of the field as well as
by the torsion of the wire, and that the damping action is
greater as the angle is less, being : : cos2 a.
                              Fig. 1.
   I thought it would be interesting to determine to what
angle the disk would be thrown if the torsion of the wire did
not act. I therefore suspended, instead of the disk, the coil
used in the absolute experiments by a silk thread, adjusted the
lower card by the method of no throw, and brought the index
to rest successively over 10°, 20°, 30°, &c. up to 90°. The
index came to rest at the series of positions shown in column 2

    The same results are shown graphically in fig. 2.        It is

 222                   Mr. C. V. Boys on a
 interesting to note that the curve shown is a natural curve
 depending on circular functions only. It is independent of
 the nature of material, such as conductivity, moment of inertia,
or of the strength to which the field is made to grow from
zero. It is subject to a small error, for I did not destroy the
residual magnetism. That the effect of this is appreciable is
evident, for in one series of experiments with a disk the throw
on making was always from 45° to 33° ; but the first time
that the direction of tho magnetizing current was changed
the throw was from 45° to 35°, after which it was from 45° to
                              Fiff. 2.
33°, as before. This diminution at the first reversal was always
the same. I found almost, the same fall with the half-crown
as with the coil, and with one cell as with ten cells. There
were slight differences, but not more than draughts from
which I did not shield the needle would have accounted for.
The lower angle can be read with precision, but tho higher
angles become difficult to observe as the damping influence
diminishes. Tho position a. = 90° is one of instability ; for how
ever slight a velocity is given to the disk, it will not be brought
to rest for a considerable time, owing to the very minute nature
of the squares of the cosines of angles nearly equal to 90°.
   The last series of experiments was made with a view to
determine whether the strength of field determined by obser
vation of the throw of the disk at breaking agreed with the

                   Magneto-electric Phenomenon.                   223
strength determined by some recognized method. I therefore
made a small coil of twelve turns of copper wire of 1"45
centim. radius and with a resistance of 0*085 ohm. The
area of the coil was 79'4 square centim. The moment of
inertia of coil and index was found by comparison with a
cylinder to be 58'1 units, and the torsional value of the sup
porting wire to be 17,000 units. The plane of the coil was
adjusted by the usual method to zero, and then set to 45°.
The currents from 10, 9, 8, &c. to 1 Grove cells were sent in
succession through the coils of the electromagnet and through
a Siemens electrodynamometer. The following Table shows
the amounts of the positive and negative impulses, the strengths

    The ends of the coil which were soldered together were then
 unsoldered without disturbing the soldered connexion between
 the torsion-wire and one end. The other end was bent so as
 to dip into a small mercury-cup in the axial line, so that a
 known current, measured by a second electrodynamometer,
 could be sent through the coil. During this change no part
 of the apparatus was moved at all ; it was, however, necessary
 to redetermine the zero position, which was now rather more
 difficult, for the resistance of the torsion-wire was so great in
 comparison with that of the coil alone, that the throw at any
 angle was only about one tenth of what it was before. As

The residual magnetism was always the same till one cell only
had been employed to excite the electromagnet, when the
deflection was clearly greater. This I repeated several times
with one and with more than one cell : a deflection of 4£°
was always obtained from one cell, and of 4° from more than
 one cell. To obtain a still higher residual magnetic effect, I
 drew the terminal along a fine wire and gradually diminished
 the field ; by this means I obtained a residual field giving a
deflection of 50-4. The magnetic fields corresponding to
the deflections 4, 4|, and 5"4 are 312, 352, and 422 absolute
units.
    Fig. 3 shows the field-intensity measured by the two
 methods. They do not agree, nor ars they quite proportional,
 nevertheless they are of the same order of magnitude. The
discrepancy is greater than would be expected from errors of
an experimental kind, even though the apparatus was hastily

that it will be worth while to carry out a series of experiments

with the accuracy and care that are needed in physical inves
tigations. This I intend to do as soon as I am able. It will
then perhaps be possible to tell whether this method of
determining conductivity or field-intensity is to be relied
upon : it certainly in convenience and simplicity compares
very favourably with any of the usual methods.

    The southern part of the island is a high plateau consisting en
 tirely of gneiss. This is very coarse, and the bedding is seldom well
 marked. The bedding, when visible, coincides with the foliation,
 and the author hopes that hereafter an order of succession may be
 established. At Rocquaino Castle occur a few slaty beds intercalated
 in the gneiss, the origin of which is somewhat difficult to under
 stand. The northern part, low ground with hummocks, consists
 principally of a group of crystalline or subcrystalline rocks, in
 constitution dioritcs or syenites. They are described by Ansted as
 sedimentary rocks metamorphosed into syenites ; but they show no
 bedding either in the many quarries, or, in general, in the shore out
 crops, nor do their varieties occur in any manner indicating an order

of succession. They appear at Castle Cornet to meet the gneiss
intrusively, and their microscopic structure is igneous. A remark
able appearance of bedded structure at Fort Doyle is the only
strong argument for a metamorphic origin, and this may be ex
plained as a caught-up mass in conjunction with crushing-planes.
The author therefore regards them as igneous.
   An oval area between St. Sampsons and St. Peter's Port is occu
pied by hornblendic rocks, locally called " birdseyc," which may be
described as hornblende-gabbros. These also have been called meta
morphic. They too, at Hogue-a-la-Perre and at another point, present
appearances of bedding ; but on the same general grounds as for
the preceding group, these also are regarded as igneous.
   Two granitic masses are described : the coarse pink granite of
Cobo, on the west coast, and the finer-grained grey granite weather
ing pink of Lancresse, on the north. Each is seen to intrude : the
Cobo granite into gneiss at Hommet Barracks ; the Lancresse granite
into diorite at Fort Le Marchant. Besides these are some smaller
masses.
   Dykes are remarkably abundant and various. Granites and elvans
are plentiful everywhere ; felsites very rare. The majority of the
dykes are diorites, varying in coarseness and often of enormous
size ; there is also mica-trap. In some of these dykes a cleavage
has been developed, so that some resemble slates. Infiltration-veins
are abundant.
   In relative age the gneiss appears to be the oldest rock, the
hornblendc-gabbro to be next, then comes the diorite group, while
the granites are newer still. Of the dykes tho newest are the com-
pactest diorites. As to the absolute geological age of the rocks
no satisfactory evidence at present is known ; it will have to be
sought for in the other islands and in France.

field." By Prof. L. C. Miall, F.G.S.
   3. " Studies on some Japanese Rocks." By Dr. Bundjiro Kot5.
Communicated by Frank llutley, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author has studied series of Japanese rocks from tho collec
tion of the Tokio University and the Geological Survey of Japan.
The microscopical investigation was carried on at the Mineralogical
Institute of Leipsic, under the direction of Prof. Zirkel, and the
chemical analyses were made in the laboratory of Prof. Knop.
   The most abundant rocks are the pyroxene-andesites, which are
not of a glassy texture, but for the most part holocrystalline. The
most abundant mineral in these rooks is a plagioclase felspar with
twinned and zonal structure, which is proved by its extinction-
angles and by the chemical analysis of its isolated fragments, to be
labradorite. Sanidine is present in small quantities.
   The augites of these rocks present many peculiarities ; they are
all decidedly pleochroic ; and they exhibit the oblique extinction in

                  Studies on some Japanese Rocks.                  227
basal sections, first pointed out by Mr. "Whitman Cross, and which is
characteristic of triclinic and not of monoclinic crystals. A careful
examination of the question has led the author to conclude that the
mineral which has lately been regarded as a rhombic pyroxene
(probably hypersthene) is really only ordinary augite cut parallel to
the optic axis. He does not regard the property of pleochroism as
distinctive of hypersthene, while the absence of a brachypinacoidal
cleavage and the presence of 10 per cent, of lime in the mineral
forbids our referring it to that species.
   The other abundant minerals in these augite-andesitcs are mag
netite, which is always present, and quartz, which occurs in some of
them, both as a primary and a secondary constituent. Hornblende
is very rare in these rocks, and when present the peripheral portions
of the crystals are seen to be converted into augite, probably by the
action of the caustic magma upon them. Enstatite is rare in these
rocks, but apatite is always found in them, whilo tridymite occurs
not unfrequently.
   The author described a number of structural variations in the
augite-andesite from different loealitios. Among the most inter
esting is a variety containing as much as 69 per cent, of silica.
   Among the less abundant rocks are the enstatite-andesite, the
quartz-augite-andesite, and the hornblende-andesites. Tho plagio-
clase-basalts of Japan can only be distinguished from the augite-
andesites by the presence in them of olivine. Magma-basalts are
rare, most of the varieties being of the dolerite type ; but under the
name of " basalt-lavas " the author describes varieties with a glassy
base.
   In an Appendix some account is given of a number of pre-Ter-
fciary rocks, including granite, one variety of which contains the new
mineral, reinite, of Fritsch (the tetragonal form of the ferrous-
tungstate), quartz-mica-diorite, diorite-porphyry, and diabase.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. "On the Geology of the Country traversed by the Canada
Pacific Eailway, from Lake Superior to the Rocky Mountains." By
Principal J. W. Dawson, C.M.G., F.R.S., F.G.S.
   This paper recorded observations made by the author with refer
ence to the geology of the north-west territories of Canada, in an ex
cursion in the summer of 1883, along the line of the Canada Pacific
Railway as far as Calgary, at the eastern base of the Rocky Moun
tains.
   After referring to the labours of the Canadian Geological Survey,
and more especially of Dr. G. M. Dawson, F.G.S., in this region,
the author proceeded to notice the Laurentian, Huronian, and other
Pre-Silurian rocks of the west of Lake Superior and the country
between that lake and the Red River. Good exposures of many of

  228                     Geological Society,
 these rocks have been made in the railway-cuttings, and important
 gold-veins have been opened up. The Laurentian rocks present a
 remarkable uniformity of structure over all the vast territory ex
 tending from Labrador to the Winnipeg river, and where they reap
 pear in the mountains of British Columbia. They are also Bimilar
 to those of South America and of Europe ; and there was on the
 table a collection of Laurentian rocks from Assouan, in Upper
 Egypt, made by the author in the past winter, which showed the
 reappearance of the same mineral characters there. In Egypt there
 is also an overlying crystalline series, corresponding in some respects
 with the Huronian. The Huronian rocks west of Lako Superior
 are, however, more crystalline than those of Lake Huron, and may
 be of greater age.
    The Palaeozoic rocks are exposed in places on the western side
 of the old crystalline rocks near the Red River, and show a remark
 able union and intermixture of Lower and Upper Silurian forms, or
 rather, perhaps, a transition from the ono fauna to the other in a
 very limited thickness of beds. The collections of Mr. Panton, of
 Winnipeg, wore referred to in this connexion.
    The Cretaceous and Eocene beds of the plains were then noticed,
 and certain sections showing the coal-bearing series described ; and
 comparisons were instituted between the Cretaceous and Eocene
succession in Canada and that in the United States and elsewhere.
    The Pleistocene drift deposits constitute a conspicuous feature on
the western prairies. Along the railway, Laurentian, Huronian,
and Palaeozoic boulders from the east may be seen all the way to the
Rocky Mountains, near which they become mixed with stones from
these mountains themselves. The vast amount of this drift from
the east and north-east, and the great distance to which it has been
carried, as well as the elevation above tho sea, are very striking.
The great belt of drift known as tho Missouri Coteau is one of the
most remarkable features of the region. It was described in some
detail where crossed by the railway, and it was shown that it must
represent the margin of an ice-laden sea, and not a land-moraine,
and that its study has furnished a key to the explanation of the drift
deposits of the plains, and of the so-called " Terminal Moraine,"
which has been traced by the geologists of the United States, from
the Coteau round the basin of the Great Lakes to the Atlantic.
   2. " On the Dyas (Permian) and Trias of Central Europe and
the true divisional line of these two formations." By the Rev.
A. Irving, B.Sc, B.A., F.G.S.
   The author, having shown (in previous papers, which appeared in
the 'Geological Magazine' during the year 1882) the inapplicability
of the " Permian System " of Murchison to the British Postcarboni-
ferous rocks, and having had reasons for doubting the supposed
conformity between the Zechstein and the Bunter in Central
Europe (on which Murchison and his collaborateurs have laid so

                  Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             229
   much stress), has, with the aid of Profs. Geinitz and Liebe and Dr.
   von Hauer, investigated the subject independently, both by exami
   nation of sections in the field, and by the study of the evidence
   preserved in the Museums, especially those of Dresden, Vienna, and
   Freiberg. The sections described in this paper are from : —(1)
   Silesia (Ostran), in which Dr. A. Dittmarsch is followed ; (2) Murane
   (Saxony) ; (3) Northern Thuringia. Those in the districts (2) and
  (3) are from the author's own observation last summer. The strati-
  graphical evidence shows that there is a very marked break in time
  between the Zechstein and the Bunterschiefer of Murchison, which
  he included in the " Permian System." Almost every kind of dis
  cordance that can possibly occur between two successive series of
  strata is shown to occur in Central Europe between the Dyas and
  Trias, and in particular between the Bunter and the Zechstein ;
  physical and stratigraphical evidence therefore confirm the classifi
  cation adopted by Geinitz on paheontological grounds.
      The meaning of the name " Dyas," which has become well esta
  blished abroad, was illustrated, since it is often overlooked by English
  geological writers ; and a dyassic order was pointed out as existing to
  some extent in the English series.
      Some general reasons, based on the physical characteristics of the
  Dyas-group, were given for regarding it as much more closely allied
  to the preceding Carboniferous than to the succeeding Trias.
      The last portion of the paper was more speculative, and in it an
  attempt was made to trace, in the facts we know of the geology of
  Central Europe, and the inferences drawn from them, the causes of
  the apparent anomaly between the fauna of the Posfc-Carboniferous
  strata of more northern Europe and that of the Alpine Trias.

       ON THE ELLIPTICITT OF PLANETS. BY L. D'aURIA, LATE
   ,        GEODETICAL ENGINEER OF THE ITALIAN ARMY*.
     4 DMITTING that planets were originally in a fluid state, how-
        ever heterogeneous their respective masses may be considered,
  their form of equilibrium, when fluid, must have been such that the
  direction of the resultant of all the forces acting upon any point of
  the free surface must have been normal to the surface itself. Now
  the form of equilibrium of any fluid mass when at rest is the sphere ;
  and when any fluid sphere is made to revolve around any one of
  its diameters, it becomes more or less flattened on its axis of rota
  tion on account of centrifugal force. This causes the sphere to
  become an oblate ellipsoid, whose minor diameter coincides with
  the axis of rotation itself ; and therefore the equation of any meri
  dian line on the surface of any fluid mass revolving around an axis

   On the other hand, let ME represent the direction and the
intensity of the attraction of the whole ellipsoid upon the point M,
which attraction we designate by g ; and put MO=p; angle MEE

g and the centrifugal force at M must coincide with the normal
MN, for centrifugal force is parallel to EE ; and since this latter

   This value is entirely too small compared with          as deduced
from geodetical measurement of arcs of meridians and parallels.
What can be concluded from this ? Are we to believe that the
theory is false ? No, it seems to be in perfect accordance with the
conditions of our globe. In fact, if the Earth is at present almost
wholly rigid, as Sir W. Thomson has shown it to be, and we admit
that, from the time when its mass was wholly liquid, its diurnal
rotation has been progressively slowed by the resistance of tides,
it follows that, as soon as the liquidity of the mass began to be
impaired by the effect of cooling, the flattening could no more

232            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
accommodate itself to the diminishing angular velocity on account
of the increasing viscosity of the mass. Hence, since that time the
theoretical ellipticity of our planet must hcve been found smaller
than the geodetical one ; and the discrepancy must have increased
to this date, to increase still more with the centuries to come.
   Comparing the actual ellipticity with that given by our equation
[a], we have a new method for investigating the physical conditions
of planets, and the retardation of their diurnal rotations.

      ON IDUNIUM, A NEW ELEMENT.           BY MARTIN WEBSKY.
   In a dense bright yellow ore, consisting essentially of zinciferous
vanadate of lead, found in the Aquadita mine in the province of
Cordova, La Plata, which is found among the minerals brought by
Professor Brackebusch from Cordova to Europe, I have detected the
presence of a new element allied to vanadium.
   If the re.d metallic acid removed by mercuric nitrate and isolated
by heating be treated with caustic ammonia it dissolves, but at
first leaves a bright yellow residue, which goes into solution, though
more slowly.
   The first portion of the solution contains almost exclusively
vanadic acid, and, when mixed with a little ammonium sulphide,
after a short time black flecks of vanadium oxide.
    The subsequent portions give, when mixed with a little ammonium
 sulphide, after a short time, far more rapidly, purple-red flecks.
    The occasion for this experiment was the unusual phenomena
 observed in the formation of a precipitate resembling silver chloride,
 and which probably contains this substance ; this was met with
 when, for the purposes of a chlorine determination, the aqueous
 extract of the soda-smelt of the ore was mixed with silver nitrate
and nitric acid, and in still greater quantities on evaporating the
 second filtrate with hydrochloric acid. After trying a series of
 suitable and also of some unsuitable processes, the precipitate was
 found to contain the silver salt of a new metallic acid, which was
 finally found in the yellow higher oxide, as well as in the lower red
one in small quantities.
   The new body, to which I assign the name of Idunium, is remark
 able for resistance of the silver salt of the higher oxide against
 reagents, but resembles in its general analytical reactions vanadic
 acid ; in the analytical separation when the latter passes into solution
 in salammoniac, the idunic acid remains in the mother liquor, and on
 the addition of ammonium sulphide it becomes red and deposits
 red idunic oxide.—Berlin Sitzungsberichte, June 19, 1884.

XXXII. On the Chemical Combination of Gases. By J. J.
   Thomson, M.A., F.R.S., Fellow and Assistant Tutor of
   Trinity College, Cambridge* .
THE view of chemical combination taken by Clausius and
       Williamson, which, as is well known, is that the atoms
which form the molecules of a compound gas are continually
changing partners, possesses many advantages. One of these
is that its consequences can be developed by mathematical
analysis, and that without any further hypotheses many im
portant results may be deduced. The following paper is an
attempt to develop mathematically some of these conse
quences ; particularly those which concern the effects of
time, pressure, the quantities of the combining bodies present,
and the temperature upon the results of the chemical com
bination. It can, I think, hardly be doubted that the effects
of these circumstances on chemical combination have been
too much neglected by chemists, and that one of the reasons
why we know so little about chemical affinity is that chemists
have confined themselves to studying the ultimate effects of
any combination, and have neglected the changes which
take place whilst the combination is still going on. To take
a quite analogous case, the science of biology would not be
in its present satisfactory condition if the biologists had
entirely confined their attention to full-grown animals and
had altogether neglected the study of embryology. Of late
years, however, more attention has been paid by chemists to

234                  Mr. J. J. Thomson on the
the influence of time, mass, and temperature on chemical
combination. Bunsen, Crafts and Meier, Friedel, Guldberg
and Waage, Horstmann, Lemoine, Victor Meyer, and others
have experimentally investigated one or other of these
points. The researches of M. Lemoine on the combination
 of hydrogen and iodine seem to be the most complete study
 of a chemical combination which we possess; and I am in
 debted to M. Lemoine's two papers in the Annates de Chimie
 et de Physique, 5™* serie, t. xii. and xxvi., for most of the
 experimental data quoted in this paper. Messrs. Guldberg
 and Waage, M. Lemoine, M. Horstmann, and Prof. Willard
 Gibbs have given theories of chemical combination which
 seem to agree well with the results of experiments.
     It is unfortunate that the only case which we can in
 vestigate mathematically on direct dynamical principles, viz.
 the combination of gases, is the one where the difficulties of
 chemical manipulation are greatest. The following theory
 is only intended to apply to gases. Before going further it
 will be well to state what we suppose takes place during
 chemical combination, for although most of what follows
 will apply to any theory of the constitution of bodies,
 yet as it is a great help to be able to form a definite " Vor-
 stellung " of what takes place, we shall assume that the
  atoms of bodies consist of one or more vortex-rings, and take
 the view of chemical combination expressed by the following
  extracts from a book written by the author of this paper
  ('On the Motion of Vortex-Rings/ pp. 114, 115, 116):—
     " When two'vortex-rings of equal strength with (as we shall
  suppose for the sake of simplicity) their planes approximately
  !parallel to each other and approximately perpendicular to the
    ine joining their centres, are moving in the same direction,
  and the circumstances are such that the hinder ring overtakes
  the one in front, then if, when it overtakes it, the shortest
  distance between the circular lines of vortex-core of the rings
  be small compared with the radius of either ring, the rings
  will not separate, the shortest distance between their central
  lines of vortex-core will remain approximately constant, and
  these circular lines of vortex-core will rotate round another
   circle midway between them, while this circle moves forward
   with a velocity of translation which is small compared with
   the linear velocity of the vortex-rings round it. We may
   suppose that the union or pairing in this way of two vortex-
   rings of different kinds is what takes place when two elements,
   of which these vortex-rings are atoms, combino chemically,
   while if the vortex-rings are of the same kind, this process is
   what occurs when the atoms combine to form molecules. If

                Chemical Combination of Gases.               235
two vortex-rings paired in the way we have described are
subjected to any disturbing influence, such as the action due
to other vortex-rings in their neighbourhood, their radii will
be changed by different amounts ; thus their velocities of
translation will become different and they will separate.
We are thus led to take the view of chemical combination
put forward by Clausius and Williamson, according to which
the molecules of a compound gas are supposed not to always
consist of the same atoms of the elementary gases, but that
these atoms are continually changing partners. In order,
however, that the compound gas should be something more
than a mechanical mixture of the elementary gases of which
it is composed, it is evidently necessary that the mean
time during which an atom is paired with another of a dif
ferent kind, which we shall call the paired time, should be
large compared with the time during which it is alone and
 free from other atoms, which we shall call the free time. If
we suppose that the gas is subjected to any disturbance, then
 this will have the effect of breaking up the molecules of the
 compound gas sooner than would otherwise be the case. It
 will thus diminish the ratio of the paired to the free time ;
 and if the disturbance is great enough the value of this ratio
 will be so much reduced that the substance will no longer
 exhibit the properties of a chemical compound, but those of
 its constituent elements. We should thus have the pheno
 menon of dissociation or decomposition                     It is
 clear, too, that the value of the ratio of the paired to the
free time for the atoms of an elementary gas will have a very
great effect on the chemical properties of the gas ; thus if
 the ratio of the free to the paired times for the atoms of the
gas be very small the gaR will not enter into combination
with other gases, for it will only do so to any great extent
when the ratio of the free to the paired time for the com
pound is less than for the atoms in the molecule of the elo-
 mentary gas ; thus we should expect that this ratio would
 be very small for the atoms of a gas like nitrogen, which
 does not combine readily with other gases. The value of this
 ratio would afford a very convenient measure for the affinity
 of the constituents of a compound for each other. It is also
 conceivable that this ratio might affect the physical properties
 of a gas ; and in a paper in the ' Philosophical Magazine '
 for June 1883, I suggested that differences in the value of
 this ratio might account for the differences in the electric
 strength of gases.
    " Two vortex-rings will not remain long together unless the
 shortest distance between the central lines of their vortex
                                  R2

236                Mr. J. J Thomson on the
core is small compared with the radius of either of the rings ;
now, as the vortex-rings approach each other they alter in
size—the one in front expands and the one in the rear con
tracts. If the rings are to remain together their radii must
become nearly equal as they approach each other, and their
planes become nearly coincident : it is evident, however, that
for this to happen the radii of the rings before they pair must
lie within certain limits. The energy of the gas, however,
and therefore the temperature, depends upon the mean radius
of the vortex-rings which form the atoms of the gas, and,
conversely, the mean radius of the vortex-rings is a function
 of the temperature ; and if the mean radius is between certain
limits the temperature must also be between limits ; thus
 unless the temperature is between certain limits the atoms
will not remain long together after they have paired, and so
 chemical combination will not take place ; this reasoning
 would indicate that chemical combination could only occur
 between certain limits of temperature, and this seems to be
the case in at any rate a great many cases of chemical com
bination.
    " The following reasoning will explain how it is that the
compound after it is formed can exist at temperatures at
which the element of which it is composed could not combine.
When the elements have once combined, the molecules of the
compound will settle down so that the radii of their vortex-
atoms will be distributed according to a definite law, and a
large proportion of the vortex-atoms will have their radii
between comparatively narrow limits, just as, in the ordinary
theory of gases, Maxwell's law gives the distribution of velo
city. Now suppose that a molecule of a compound of the
elements A and B is subjected to any disturbance tending to
change the radii of the atoms ; though the difference in the
changes in the radii may be sufficient to cause the atoms to
separate, yet since the atoms were close together when they
were disturbed the difference in the changes must be small;
and since the motion is reversible the atom A would only
have to suffer a slight change to be able to combine again
with a vortex-ring like B, or it could combine at once with a
vortex-ring differing only slightly in radius from B. Thus A
will have plenty of chances of recombination with the B
atoms, and will be in a totally different position with regard
to them from that in which it would have been if it had not
previously been in combination with a B atom."
   As the question of the splitting up of the molecules is a
very important one, we shall proceed to consider it more in
detail. The configuration of two vortex-rings moving round

                 Chemical Combination of Gases.              237
each other in the way we have described will tend to alter
when the rings are placed in a region where the distribution
of velocity is not uniform. Now the configuration may change
so that the rings tend to get closer together, or so that they
tend to separate: in the first case, as the rings get closer
together the effect of the disturbance will be to make the
connection between the rings firmer, but in the second case
the disturbance will tend to separate the rings. Now let us
suppose that we have two rings moving in the disturbed fluid:
if the effect of the disturbance be to make the one in front
move faster than the one in the rear, then the disturbance
will tend to separate the rings; but if the disturbance in the
fluid makes the one in front move more slowly than the one
in the rear, the effect of the disturbance will be to make the
rings cling more closely together. Now the properties of
vortex-motion are such that if the distribution of velocity in
the fluid is not uniform, then when two vortex-rings are
moving together in one direction the effect of the disturbance
in the fluid will be to make the ring in front move more
slowly than the one in the rear, while when they move in the
opposite direction the effects of the disturbance will be to
tend to make the ring in front move faster than the one in
the rear, and so tend to separate the rings. Thus we see
that it follows from our theory of chemical combination that
a molecule of a compound gas would tend to split up if it
moved in one way, while it would have no such tendency if
it moved in the opposite direction. If we take as the dis
turbance that produced by an electric field, then it follows
that those molecules in the field which move in one direction
relatively to the lines of electric force will tend to split up
or be dissociated, while those moving in the opposite direction
 will experience no such effect. This, taken in conjunction
 with the theory of the electric discharge mentioned above,
 will, I think, account for many of the differences between
 the positive and the negative discharge ; in this paper, how
 ever, I shall confine myself to the more purely chemical
 effects.
    We shall find it important to remember that there are two
 kinds of dissociation: in the first the molecules are split up
 by external aid, such as the action of light or electricity ; in
 the second the body suffers dissociation at a high temperature
 without there being any external disturbance. It is usual to
 assume that the increase in the number of collisions is the
 cause of the dissociation at high temperatures ; but when we
 come to discuss the experiments on dissociation we shall, I
 think, see reasons for believing that this is at any rate not

 238                Mr. J. J. Thomson on the
 the primary cause. We must remember that even though
 there were no disturbance two vortex-rings would only stay
  together for an infinitely long time if the shortest distance
  between their circular lines of vortex-core were infinitesimally
  small compared with the radius of the ring ; if this were not
  the case, two rings would separate of themselves after a time,
  which depends on the ratio of the shortest distance between
  their circular axes to the radius of the ring. Thus even if the
 rings suffered no collisions they would come apart after a time;
  and the experiments seem to show that some such cause as
  this is, in some cases of dissociation, more effective than the
 collisions.
     § 1. We shall now go on to consider the subject analytically;
 we shall take a very simple case to begin with, and treat it in
 great detail. The case we shall begin with is that of the dis
 sociation of a simple gas whose molecules are diatomic, and
 we shall suppose that the gas is a mixture of atoms and
 molecules. The problem of finding the differential equations
 which would be true for all stages of chemical combination
 would lead to results of great complexity ; we shall content
 ourselves with investigating the case when things have settled
 down into some degree of regularity. We shall suppose that
 the circumstances have become such that during the mean
 time a molecule is paired the change in the number of mole
 cules is only a small fraction of their whole number. This
 will not be the case when violent chemical action first com
 mences, but things will soon settle down into a state when
 this will be true. We shall also suppose that all the atoms
 remain paired for the same time t and free for the time T :
 this of course is not, strictly speaking, the case, as the time
 the various molecules are paired will be different; but if t is
 proportional to the mean paired time, and T to the mean free
 time, the general results obtained on this supposition will
 agree with those obtained on the more accurate hypothesis,
 which it is impossible to use, as we do not know the expres
 sion which tells how many molecules have any particular
paired time.
    To go back to the case of the dissociated gas, let m be the
number of molecules at any time, n the number of atoms at
the same time; then if the gas is in a closed vessel, n + 2?n
will be constant and equal to N, the number of atoms there
would be if all the molecules were dissociated. Let t and T
have the same meaning as before. T will evidently be in
versely proportional to n ; let it equal rjn. Now consider
what happens in the time St: in this time niSt/t of the mole
cules will be split up ; for, as wc suppose the rate of forma

                 Chemical Combination of Gases.              239
tion of the molecules to remain approximately constant during
the time t, the number of molecules formed in the time x
bears to the number formed in the time t the ratio of x to t ;
but the number formed in t is m, so that the number formed
in x is mx/t. But the number of molecules dissociated in the
time St is the same as the number formed in the interval St,
t seconds ago, so that the number of molecules split up in
the time St is mSt/t. In exactly the same way we see that the
number of pairs of atoms which combine in the time St=
nSt/T=n*St/r; so that if Sm be the increase in the number of
 molecules in the time St, we have
                              T    t
or                                                           (1)

This equation will always determine n ; if the dissociation is
slight, so that the number of atoms is small compared with
the number of molecules, wo have

From this equation we see that if t and t aro independent of
N, which will be the case if the process is a reversible one,
and the dissociation produced by the action of light or elec
tricity, then the ratio of the atoms actually free to the whole
number of atoms in the gas is inversely proportional to the
square root of the density, the temperature being supposed to

tion produced is inversely proportional to the square root of
the density.
   It will be easy and convenient to express equation (3) as
an equation giving the vapour-density of the dissociated gas.
Let A be the vapour-density of the dissociated gas, D the
vapour-density of the gas when it is not dissociated ; then

Substituting these values for n and m, equation (2) becomes
Now if p be the pressure of the gas, p = cN, where c is a con
stant ; substituting for n we have
   Equations (3) and (4) could be applied most easily to the
case when the dissociation is produced by external agency,
such as light or electricity, because in this case t and t would
be independent of N, and these equations would then give the
vapour-density of the gas at different pressures, the disturb
ance producing the dissociation remaining the same. No
quantitative measurements seem, however, to have been made
for such a case. Some experiments have been made on the
dissociation of iodine-vapour by heat. If the dissociation
were due in this case to the collision of the particles, then the
paired time would vary inversely as the number of collisions,
and therefore inversely as N, so that Nt would be constant,
and, as equations (3) and (4) show, the dissociation would be
the same at all pressures ; the experimental results show that
 this is not the case, so that from our point of view we cannot
assume that the collisions are the cause of the dissociation.
Another circumstance which points to the same conclusion is
 the fact that dissociation is very much hindered by the pre
 sence of a neutral gas; if the dissociation were due to shocks,

                 Chemical Combination of Gases.                  241
then the presence of the neutral gas would increase the
number of atoms, and therefore the number of shocks, and so
would diminish the paired time, while, as we can hardly con
ceive that the presence of a neutral gas can make the atoms
combine more quickly, the free time will not be diminished.
Thus if the collision theory were correct, the dissociation
would be increased by the presence of a neutral gas. The fact
that this is not the case shows that the mere increase in the
number of collisions, if the increase be produced by the collision
of different bodies, will not produce increased dissociation.
We must remember that, as was remarked before, two atoms
will not remain together indefinitely, even if there are no
collisions. In the following table I have calculated by means
of equation (4) the quantity of iodine-vapour which would be
dissociated if the paired time were independent of N, and if
the collisions were not the cause of the dissociation, and com
pared them with the experimental results obtained by Crafts
and Meier (Comptes Rendus, 3 Janvier, 1881, p. 41, quoted
by M. Lemoine, Annates de Chimie et de Physique, 5me serie,
t. xxvi. p. 347) ; the theoretical and the experimental results
agree so closely that the difference between them might be
accounted for by errors of experiment. The constant — which
occurs in equation (4) is determined by making the theo
retical and the experimental results agree at the pressure '4
of an atmosphere. I have taken D, the vapour-density of
normal (i. e. not dissociated) iodine-vapour, to be 8-78.

same way as before wo find »/N=-125;
or the free time is only about 1/9 of the paired time.
   The close agreement between the observed results and those
calculated by equation (4) seems to show that the dissociation
in this case is produced by external agency and not by tho
collision of the molecules themselves. The radiant heat from
the sides of the vessel containing the iodine-vapour would
tend to dissociate the vapour, and this may be the external
agency required. This consideration suggests the view that
the absorption of radiant heat by gases may be due, at least
in part, to the dissociation of the gas by the radiant heat.
This dissociation would absorb energy, and therefore the
radiant heat. This view would account for gases whose mole
cular structures are complex absorbing neat much more
powerfully than the elementary gases ; for it is very probable
that the radiant heat employed in experiments on the absorp
tion of heat by gases is powerful enough to dissociate bodies
of complicated structure, but not powerful enough to disso
ciate the elementary gases. We must, however, leave this
subject for the present and return to that of chemical combi
nation.
   Wo have seen how the ratio of the free to the paired time
can be determined by observations made when things have
settled down into a state of equilibrium. We cannot, how
ever, by observations of this kind determine t and t separately.
To do this we must, as we can see by referring to the diffe

               Chemical Combination of Gases.                 243
rential equations (1) and (2), make observations before things
have got into a steady state. If the atoms could in any way
be withdrawn from the field of action as soon as they are
formed—if, for example, they combined with some solid body
which had no effect upon the molecules—then we could deter
mine t, the paired time, by measuring the rate at which mole
cules of the gas must flow into a vessel containing the solid
body and the gas undergoing dissociation, in order that the
pressure in the vessel should remain constant. For if m be
the number of molecules in the vessel, since the atoms are
absorbed as soon as produced, the rate at which the molecules
diminish is m/t, so that if the pressure is to remain constant
molecules must flow into the vessel at the rate m/t ; in this way
we could determine t. If the chemical action is slow, we
might find this quantity in another way. We have by equa
tion (1)

   Now K only involves the ratio of t to t, which we can find
by experiments on the steady state. Thus K is known, and this
equation will enable us to find r ; and since we know the ratio
of t to t, we shall be able to find t.
   § 2. We can investigate in a similar way the case when
the molecules of two compound or elementary gases enter
into chemical combination without being previously decom
posed, such, for example, as the case when PC18 and Cla com

244                 Mr. J. J. Thomson on the
bine to form PC16, or the reverse action when PC15 is decom
posed into these two gases.
    Let us suppose that the molecules of a gas A can combine
with the molecules of another gas, B, without either of them
being decomposed, and that one molecule of A combines with
one of B, to form one of a compound C. Let m, n, p be the
number of molecules at any time of A, B, C respectively, let
us suppose the gases placed in a closed vessel, and let M and
N be the total number of molecules of A and B respectively
in the vessel ; then
                      m+p=M, and n+^? = N.
 Let us suppose that the molecules of A and B remain
 together in the compound C for a time t, and let a molecule
 of A remain apart from a molecule of B for the time r/n ; then,
 just as in paragraph (1), we have
                        dp_mn_ P
                        di~ T t

                         dt~J        T
    Now when things have got into a state of equilibrium
                           dp dm dn
                           dt' ~di' dt
 all vanish, and we have
                              mn _ p
 or
                       (M-/>) (N-j>) =-xP                      (6)
  This equation gives the quantity of the compound C formed
  when the elements A and B are mixed in any proportion. To
  consider the simplest case, first let M = N, so that equal quan
  tities of the gases A and B are mixed together, or, what
  amounts to the same thing, we may suppose that we have
  initially a quantity of the compound C in a vessel, and then
  by some means or another it gets dissociated. In this case,
  putting M = N, we have

                  Chemical Combination of Gases.              245
This case is exactly the same as the dissociation of an elemen
tary gas which we considered in § 1. M. Friedel (Bulletin
de la Socidte' Chimique, 1875, p. 160, 1876, p. 241, quoted by
M. Lemoine, Annates de Chimie et de Physique, 5me s^rie,
t. xxvi. p. 324) has made a series of investigations on the com
bination of oxide of methyl with hydrochloric acid; this com
bination is a case of the kind we are considering, as in this
combination one molecule of oxide of methyl combines with
one molecule of hydrochloric acid. Let us first compare the
results obtained by M. Friedel at different pressures with the
results given by equation (6), which may be written
where II is the pressure expressed in atmospheres; we suppose,
as before, that the collisions do not affect the dissociation.
The constant C is determined by making the calculated and
observed values of p agree at the pressure of one atmosphere.

Though the observed and calculated results agree tolerably
closely, yet the differences between them, considering the
comparatively small range of pressure, seem greater than can
be accounted for by errors of experiment, and seem to suggest
that in this case the collisions may slightly affect the dissocia
tion.
    From these experiments we have
                            ^=5-28
at the pressure of one atmosphere ; but at this pressure
m/M=-86, so that

 246                 Mr. J. J. Thomson on the
 so that for the compound of oxide of methyl and hydrochloric
 acid at the pressure of one atmosphere the free time is about
 6*14 times the paired time.
    We will now go on to consider the effects of either the
 methyl oxide or the hydrochloric acid being in excess. To do
 this we must uso equation (6), viz.
                      Ql-p) (S-p)=lp.
 We can calculate the quantity T/t if we know the quantity of
 the compound formed when equal quantities of oxide of
 methyl and hydrochloric acid are present, i.e. when M = N.
 We can then, by the use of this equation, determine the
 quantity which ought to be formed when the methyl oxide and
 the hydrochloric acid are mixed in any other proportion. In
 the experiments we shall compare with the results obtained by
 this equation the methyl oxide was in excess. We shall
 measure this excess, which we shall call e, by the rate of the
 difference between the number of free methyl oxide and
hydrochloric molecules to the number of hydrochloric mole
 cules in the vessel, so that
                             w=m+eM.
Equation (6) then becomes

   The agreement of these, with the exception of the last,
is as close as could be expected; the last discrepancy, how
ever, seems to show that some circumstances which we have
neglected have to be considered, and the most likely one
seems to be the effect of the collisions.      If this were so, we

                C/iemical Combination of Gases.            247
might soo some reason for a remarkablo result obtained by
M. Friedel, viz. that the effects when the methyl oxide was
in excess were slightly different from those when the hydro
chloric acid was in excess. For it is probable that the effects
of a collision, when a molecule of a compound is struck by
a molecule of methyl oxide, will not be the same as if it
be struck by a molecule of hydrochloric acid ; so that the
effect of the collisions produced when the methyl oxide is in
excess will be different from those produced when the hydro
chloric acid is in excess.
   If there are any solid or liquid substances which unite
directly with oxide of methyl or hydrochloric acid, we
can determine the values of T ,and i by the first method in
§ 1. We can also determine these quantities if we can find
any solid or liquid that will combine with the compound
formed by the combination of these gases, and yet not with
the gases themselves. For suppose wo have a quantity of
this solid in a vessel filled with a mixture of equal parts of
oxide of methyl and hydrochloric acid, and that the pressure
in this chamber is kept constant by allowing oxide of methyl
and hydrochloric acid to stream in at a measured rate. Then,
since N = M, the rate of formation of the compound is N2/V;
and as it is absorbed by the solid as soon as made, the rate
at which either the methyl oxide or the hydrochloric acid
must stream in, in order to keep the pressure constant, is
 Ns/t; if we measure this quantity, since we know N we can
 find t. If we can use neither of these ways we must try
 the second method of § 1.
    The dissociation of the pentachloride of phosphorus PC1S
 into PC13 and Cl3 is another example of the case we are con

 with the vapour-densities at those pressures observed by
 M. Wurtz (Comptes Rendus, lxxvi. p. 601). The vapour-

   § 3. In the cases we have hitherto considered only three
systems of particles were present, viz. the molecules of A,
B, and C. The next case we shall consider is one which is
well illustrated by the combination of hydrogen and chlorine;
in this case we have five systems of particles—the atoms and
molecules of hydrogen, the atoms and molecules of chlorine,
and the molecules of hydrochloric acid. We proceed to
investigate this case, using the same principles as in the
former.
   Let m    = the number of hydrogen atoms.
        n   = the number of hydrogen molecules.
        p   = the number of chlorine atoms.
        q   = the number of chlorine molecules.
         r  = the number of hydrochloric-acid molecules.
         tj = the time two hydrogen atoms remain paired
                together in the hydrogen molecule.
        <s = the time two chlorine atoms remain paired
                together in the chlorine molecule.
        <s = the time a hydrogen atom is paired with one of
                chlorine in the hydrochloric-acid molecule.
        — = the time during which a hydrogen atom is free
        m      from another hydrogen atom.
        — = the time a hydrogen atom is free from a chlorine
        P      atom.
        I* = the time a chlorine atom is free from another
         P     chlorine atom.
        M = the total number of hydrogen atoms, whether
                free or in combination with other atoms.
        N = the total number of chlorine atoms, whether free
               or in combination with other atoms.
  Then, as in § 2, we have the following equations:—

We shall get much simpler equations if we suppose, as is
nearly always the case, that the number of free atoms of
hydrogen or chlorine is very small compared with the number
of hydrogen or chlorine molecules respectively. Making this
assumption, we may write

   Let us first suppose that equal quantities of the two gases
hydrogen and chlorine are present, so that M= N; in this case
equation (9) becomes
                                               ¦   •   •  ¦  m
Now if the decomposition is due to the action of some
external disturbance such as light, radiant heat, or electricity,
the <'s and t's will not be functions of the pressure, and we
shall get an equation for r/N, which does not involve the
pressure; thus the proportion of the compound dissociated
is independent of the pressure. This case offers, in this
respect, a remarkable contrast to the preceding one. But
even if the compound were dissociated by heat, and we were
to suppose the dissociation produced by the collisions, though
we gave reasons before for supposing this view to be erro
neous, still since only tu t2, t3 are affected by the number
of collisions, and as they enter into equation (10) in the
form <3Vi'j> we see that unless the ratio of these quantities
is altered by the collisions, the dissociation will be the same
at all pressures. Thus we should expect that in this case
the dissociation will be very much less influenced by pres
sure than in the preceding one. This has been confirmed
by the researches of M. Lemoine on the vapour of hydriodic
acid; he found that the dissociation of this compound was
only very slightly affected by the pressure.
   Equation (9) enables us to find the quantity of hydro
chloric acid produced when hydrogen and chlorine are mixed
in any proportion, though no quantitive experiments seem
to have been made on hydrochloric acid, yet M. Lemoine
 (Annales de Chimie et de Physique, 5me serie, t. xii.) has made
a very elaborate series of experiments on the analogous case
of the combination of hydrogen and iodine, and we can com
pare the results of our theory with his experiments. The
experimental results given below were made at a temperature
of 440° 0. We determine the value of '32t1t3/<1;3t2:! by
making the result given by equation (9), when N = M, agree
with the experimental results : if we do this we arrive at the
following results:—

Hero the agreement between theory and experiment is as
close as could be expected.
   We also find from the experimental results that
   We have just seen that <s*tits/Mjt»2 c&n be determined by
observations made when things have settled into a state of
equilibrium ; we shall require, however, other observations to
determine the t's and the t's separately.          Let us suppose
that the dissociation is produced by some external agency ;
then <x will be the same for hydrogen alone as for hydrogen
and chlorine mixed, and we may suppose that tx and tt haVe
been determined by experiments on hydrogen and chlorine
separately by one of the methods of § 1. Suppose that we
have an arrangement for taking the hydrochloric acid away
as soon as it is formed (this may be done by absorbing it
by water, as in Bunsen's and Roscoe's experiments on the
combination of hydrogen and chlorine exposed to the action
of light), and that equal quantities of hydrogen and chlorine
stream into the vessel where combination occurs at such a
rate as to keep the pressure there constant; then if v be the
number of molecules of either hydrogen or chlorine which
flow into the combination-chamber in the unit of time,
instead of equation (7) we have the following set of equa
tions, the notation being the same as before:—
                              m2    n
                           v=vrv

252                Mr. J. J. Thomson on the
    Now if M be the number of hydrogen or chlorine atoms
in the vessel where the combination takes place, since m and
p are small compared with n and q respectively, we may put
n = q = ^M, and equation (11) becomes
                    KX~|)=^-'                      •  •  •  ™
Now of the quantities involved in' this equation, we know
», M, ft, t2, so that it will enable us to find t^/t^ ; but
equation (9) will give us ^^2/1^^3', hence we can find t3.
We require two more equations to enable us to determine
all the f's and t's. Let a and £ be the specific gravities of
normal hydrogen and chlorine respectively; then the specific
gravities of the hydrogen and chlorine in the vessel where
combination takes place, are respectively

     By observing the specific gravity of the mixture when the
  pressure is made to vary, t. e. when M is made to vary, we
  shall get equations sufficient to determine tx and t3, and then
  by equation (12) we can find t2, so that in this way all the
  f's and t's could be determined.

    § 4. Hitherto we have only considered the combination of
two monad elements ; the same theory will, however, apply
to the combination of any two elements of the same quanti-
valence. We shall now go on to consider the more complex
case of the combination of a dyad element with a monad,
when two atoms of one are combined with one of the other;
as a typical case we may take water, H20. Here the question
arises, does the combination consist in an atom of oxygen
uniting with a molecule of hydrogen, or is it necessary that
the hydrogen molecule should be itself split up, and that
combination takes place when two atoms of hydrogen meet
with an atom of oxygen ? We shall suppose that both methods
of combination take place, and then, after the investigation
is complete, we may deduco either case by giving special values
to the constants.
   Let m    — the number of hydrogen atoms,
         n  = the nunil>er of hydrogen molecules.
         p  = the number of oxygen atoms.

         r   = the number of water molecules.
         M  = the total number of hydrogen atoms free and
                 combined.

         /3 = the time the atoms remain together in the water
                 molecule before splitting up into a molecule
                 of H and an atom of 0.
              the time tho atoms remain together in the water

        mp       atom meets simultaneously with another free

                will be inversely proportional to mp, since if
                m and p be large, mji is the number of groups,

   Let us begin by finding the values of m, n, p, q, r when
things have attained a steady state ; we shall first assume
that the molecule of water is formed by a molecule of hydrogen
uniting with an atom of oxygen, and that when a molecule of
water is decomposed it splits up into a molecule of hydrogen
and an atom of oxygen. These assumptions are represented
by making t3' and t3 both infinite, and when things are in
equilibrium the above equations become

   Now if we suppose, as in § 3, that the number of free
oxygen and hydrogen atoms is very small compared with the

may put

                              ?=i(N ~r).
So that the last equation becomes
                    r»=i|i^CM-2r)'(N-r)                    (15)
   It is evident from this equation that the quantity of the
compound formed will depend upon the density, for if we
make M = 2N we see that the equation can be expressed as
an equation in r/M alone ; but the coefficients will involve M,
so that the value of r/M will depend upon the density. If
we suppose that r/M is small we see from equation (15) that
r/M increases as M increases, so that a larger proportion woul J
combine at great pressures than at small; or if we look upon
it as a case of dissociation we may express the same thing by
saying that the dissociation increases as the pressure dimi
nishes. Thus the dissociation of water differs in this respect
from the dissociation of hydrochloric acid.
    Let us now take the other alternative, and suppose that a
water molecule is formed by the union of two separate hydro
gen atoms with an oxygen atom, and that when a water
molecule is decomposed it splits up into two free hydrogen
atoms and an oxygen atom ; in this case t3 and t2 are both
 infinite, and when things have attained a steady state the

which is an equation of exactly the same form as the one we
obtained on the first hypothesis ; hence we could not distin
guish between these hypotheses by observing the quantity of
water formed when there is equilibrium.
    But if the water is absorbed as soon as it is formed, and
a steady stream of oxygen and hydrogen flows into the vessel
where combination takes place at such a rate as to keep the
pressuro there constant, and if v molecules of hydrogen flow

This equation is not the samo as the previous one ; we may
supposo that tl has been found by experiments on hydrogen

described, and measuring the rate at which hydrogen and
oxygen must flow into the vessel where the combination takes
place so as to keep the pressure there constant, we could de
termine whether equation (19) or (20) agreed best with the
 results of the experiments, and in this way determine which
 is the right hypothesis.

ozone consists of three atoms of oxygen. We may prove, in
the same way as before, that if v be the number of ozone
molecules and N the total number of oxygen atoms, whether
freo or in oxygen molecules or in ozone, that

   These equations are of exactly the same type, and according
to both of them the proportion of ozone formed ought to
increase with the density of the oxygen from which it is
formed. I am not aware whether this has been observed or
not. The decomposition of steam by the silent electrical dis
charge would be a very suitable case for comparing the theory
Siven in this paragraph with experiment ; but though the
  ecomposition has been observed, no quantitative experiments
seem to have been made on this subject. In fact no such
experiments seem to have been made on the combination of
any dyad element with a monad.
   § 5. We will now go on to investigate the following case
which occurs frequently in chemical investigations. Three
monovalent gases A, B, C are mixed together in a closed
vessel. A can combine with both B and C to form the com
pounds AB, AC respectively; but B and C cannot combine.
We wish to find how much of each compound is formed.

               whether freo or in molecules, or in the com
               pounds AB and AC.
        N = the total number of atoms of B, whether free
               or in molecules of B, or in the molecules of
               (AB).

    Now the number of free atoms will in all practical cases
 be very small compared with the number of molecules, so
 that to, p, r are very small compared with n, q, s respec
 tively, so that we may put

  So that equations (25) become

 two equations to determine         and «. If we put M = N = P
  we have two equations for u / M, r / M, the coefficients oi'
  which do not involve M; so that unless a and $are functions
  of the density the same proportion of the gases will enter
  into combination at all pressures. We see from equation (25 )
  that the number of molecules of the compound AB is pro
  portional to the geometric mean of the number of free mole
  cules of A and B, and similarly that the number of molecules
  of the compound AC is proportional to the geometric mean
  of the number of free molecules of A and C. If we look at
  the value of a we see, by comparing it with the results given
  in § 8, that it can be determined by experiments on the com
  bination of A and B by themselves. Thus from the experi
  ments of M. Lemoine we see that for hydrogen and iodine

 with some monovalent substance which combines with the
 hydrogen, but not with the iodine, the number of molecules
 of hydriodic acid is about 6*2 times the geometric mean of
the numbers of the free hydrogen and iodine molecules, and,
 generally, equations (25) show that in all cases of combina
 tion of this kind the number of molecules of the compound
 AB bears to the geometric mean of the numbers of free mole
cules of A and B a ratio which is independent of the nature
 of the substance C, and similarly the number of AC mole
 cules bears to the geometric mean of the numbers of the
 uncombined A and 0 molecules a ratio which is independent
 of the nature of B.
    § 6. I have not been able to find any researches bearing
on the kind of chemical combination considered in the last
paragraph ; but as the somewhat analogous combination which
takes place when hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and oxygen are
mixed together and then exploded has been studied by several
chemists, we shall in this paragraph investigate theoretically
the result of such combination, although the case is not one
where we should expect to find a very close agreement between
the calculated and the observed results, as so much heat is
generated in the explosion that the temperature must vary
greatly during the time combination is taking place, and thus
complicate the question. We shall suppose that water is
produced by the combination of a molecule of hydrogou with
an atom of oxygen, and carbonic acid by the combination of
a molecule of carbonic oxide with an atom of oxygen ; we
shall also suppose that the hydrogen does not combine with
the carbonic oxide.
   Let m   = the number of hydrogen molecules,
        n  = the number of oxygen atoms.
        p  = the number of oxygen molecules.
        r  = the number of carbonic oxide molecules.
        8  — the number of water molecules.
        u  = the number of carbonic acid molecules.
        ti = the time two hydrogen atom3 remain together in
               the hydrogen molecule.
        /3 = the time two oxygon molecules remain together
               in the oxygen molecule.
        /3 = the time an oxygen atom stays with a hydrogen
               molecule in the water molecule.
        t4 = the time an oxygen atom stays with a carbonic
               oxide molecule in the moloculo of carbonic
               acid.

       — = the time an oxj-gen atom remains free from a
               carbonic oxide molecule.
        M = the total number of hydrogen molecules, whether
              free or in the water molecule.
        N = the total number of oxygen atoms, whether free
               or in oxygen molecules, or in water, or carbonic
              acid molecules, but not counting the oxygen

These two equations are sufficient to determine s and m, and
we see that, since the right-hand side of the equations contains
cubes of the number of molecules, while the left-hand side
only contains squares, the combination will be relatively
greater at high than at low pressures, at any rate when tho
quantity of the gases which combine is small compared with
the quantity of them which is left free.
   From equations (27) wo see that
                         */«=r ;? rir,
so that the ratio of tho quantitj- of water formed to the quan
tity of carbonic acid always bears a constant ratio to the
ratio of quantity of hydrogen left free to the quantity of free
carbonic oxide. The following account of Horstmann's
experiments on this reaction from Watts's ' Dictionary of
Chemistry,' 3rd Supplement, p. 433, is of interest in connec
tion with this result :—
   " The law according to which the oxygen is divided between
the combustible gases may be expressed thus :—The propor
tion of the resulting water-vapour to the resulting carbon
dioxide is equal to the proportion of the unburnt hydrogen
to the unburnt carbon oxide, multiplied by a coefficient of
affinity which is independent of tho proportion of tho com
bustible gases, but varies with tho relative quantities of oxygen
added. This coefficient of affinity varies, according to Horst-
mann, between 4 0 and 6*4 when between 20 and 70 per cent,
of the combustible gases is burnt, the maximum coefficient
coinciding with the combustion of 30-40 per cent, of the

                Chemical Combination of Gases.               2(>3
gases. In other words, the proportion of water-vapour to
carbon dioxide was found to be from 4-0 to 6*4 times as great
as the proportion of hydrogen to carbon oxide in the residue
unburnt. Hence relatively more hydrogen than carbon oxide
is burnt in all cases ; the affinity of oxygen for hydrogen is
greater than for carbon oxide.
   " The variability in the coefficient of affinity is due to the
circumstance that the physical conditions of the reaction vary
with the relative quantities of oxygen present. With equal
quantities of oxygen the coefficient remains constant, not only
when the proportion of hydrogen to carbonic oxide is altered,
but also when the unconsumed portion of the combustible
gases is replaced partially or entirely by an indifferent gas of
similar physical character, such as nitrogen, although the
proportion of unburnt gases to products of combustion varies
in both cases."
   § 7. The next case we shall consider is when three atoms
of ono element A unite with one of another element B to form
the compound which we shall denote by A3 B. This case is
more complicated than any of the previous ones when the
combination could always be supposed to take place by an
atom or molecule of one substance uniting with an atom of
another. We may make several hypotheses about the way in
which the compound A3B may be formed.
    1. We may suppose that there is, in addition to free atoms
and molecules of A, a very small number of triplets; this
number may be supposed to be very small compared with
 the number of molecules or even of free atoms of A. We
 may then suppose that the molecule of the compound A3B is
 formed by one of those triplets combining with an atom
 of B.
   2. We may suppose that the molecule of A3B is formed
by an atom and a molecule of A meeting simultaneously with
each other and with an atom of B.
    3. We may suppose that three free atoms of A meet
simultaneously with each other and with an atom of B.
   We shall investigate the consequences of each of these
 hypotheses. Let us begin with the first hypothesis.
   Let m   = the  number of atoms of A.
        n  = the  number of molecules of A.
        p  = the  number of triplets of A.
        q  = the  number of atoms of B.
        r  = the   number of molecules of B.
        *  = the  number of molecules of the compound A3B.

264                Mr. J. J. Thomson on the
       M = the total number of A atoms, whether free, in
              molecules, in triplets, or in molecules of AjB.
       N = the total number of B atoms.
       fj = the time the atoms in the A molecule stay
              together.
       t, = the time the atoms in the A triplets stay together.
       '3   the time the atoms
              together.
       tt = the time the triplet A3 stays with the atom of
              B in the molecule of A3B.
       — = the time an atom of A is free from one other
       m     atom of A.
       ~ = the time an atom of A is free from a molecule
       "     of A.
       -! = the time a triplet of A is free from an atom of B.
       -i = the time one atom of B is free from another
       9     atom of the same.
  Then if we suppose that when the molecule of A3B is
decomposed it splits up into the triplet A3 and the atom B,
and that when a triplet of A is decomposed it splits up into an
atom and a molecule of A, we get the following equations:—

                      «s=1JB«(M-3s)3(K-s)                 (32)
      We see from the form of this equation that the combi
  nation will be relatively greater at high than at low pres
 sures. We may express this equation in words by saying
 that the ratio of the number of molecules of A3B to the
 number of free molecules of A is equal to the geometric
 mean of the number of free molecules of A and B multiplied
 by a constant.
     The most prominent case of combination of this kind is
 that of the formation of ammonia when the silent electrical
 discharge is allowed to pass through a mixture of hydrogen
 and nitrogen. The formation of triplets of hydrogen atoms
 in this case seems not unlikely, as triplets of oxygen atoms
 would be formed under the same circumstances. The exist
ence of ozone is detected by its possessing the properties of
oxygen in an exaggerated degree, so that it is possible that
if the properties of oxygen had not been so marked the
existence of ozone might have been overlooked.
     Let us now go on to discuss the second hypothesis.
    Let the notation be the same as before, with the addition
that — = the time that elapses before an atom of A unites
       nq
with a molecule of A and an atom of B simultaneously.

  a formula of exactly the same form as the one obtained on
  the first hypothesis, so that the equilibrium state is the same
  whichever hypothesis we adopt.

           m1      unites with two free atoms of A and an atom
                   of B simultaneously,
  this quantity is evidently inversely proportional to m^q, as
  m'2y is the number of groups, if m and q be large, which
  can be formed of two A atoms and one B atom. If we sup
  pose that there are no triplets, and that the molecules of A3B
   when decomposed split up into three atoms of A and one of
   B, we have the following equations :—

 sults when there is chemical equilibrium.
    We might apply similar principles to any case of gaseous
 combination ; but after what has been given the reader will,
 I think, have no difficulty in forming for himself the equations
 which hold for any particular case. In conclusion, I may say
 that much of the reasoning would seem to be applicable to
 liquids, and we should expect many of the formulae to be
 approximately true for the combination of liquids as well as
 of gases, though we know so little about the molecular com
 position of liquids that it is difficult to base the reasoning in
 this case on direct dynamical principles.

                By James Croll, LL.D., F.R.S*
THERE are few facts within the domain of geology better
        established than that at frequent periods in the past
the polar regions enjoyed a comparatively mild and equable
climate, and that places now buried under permanent snow
and ice were then covered with a rich and luxuriant vegeta
tion. Various theories have been advanced to account for
this remarkable state of things, such as a different distribution
of sea and land, a change in the obliquity of the ecliptic, a
displacement in the position of the earth's axis of rotation,
and so forth. The true explanation will, I feel persuaded, bo
found to be the one I gave many years ago. The steps by
which the results were reached were as follows :—¦
   The annual quantity of heat received from the sun at the
equator is to that at the poles as 12 to 4/98, or, say, as 12 to 5.
This is on the supposition that the same percentage of rays is
cut off by the atmosphere at the equator as at the poles, which,
of course, is not the case. More is cut off at the poles than
 at the equator, and consequently the difference in the amount
 of heat received at the two places is actually greater than that
 indicated by the ratio 12 to 5. But, assuming 12 to 5 to be
 the ratio, the question arose what ought to be the difference
 of temperature between the two places in question on the
 supposition that the temperature was due solely to the direct
 heat received from the sun ? This was a question difficult
 to answer, for its answer mainly depended upon two things,
 regarding both of which a very considerable amount of un
 certainty prevailed.
    First, it was necessary to know how much of the total
 amount of heat received by the earth was derived from the
 sun and how much from the stars and other sources, or, in
 other words, from space. Absolute zero is considered to be
 461° below zero Fahr. The temperature of the equator is
 about 80°, This gives 541° as the absolute temperature of
 tho equator. Now were all the heat received by the earth
 derived simply from the sun, and wero the temperaturo of
 each place proportionate to the amount directly received, then
 the absolute temperature of the poles would be A of that
 of tho equator, or 225°. This would give a difference of 316°
 between the temperature of the equator and that of the poles.
 According to Pouillet and Herschel, space has a tempera
 ture of —239°, or 222° of absolute temperature. If this be
                    * Communicated by the Author.

               On the Cause of Mild Polar Climates.           269
 the temperature of space, then only 319° of the absolute tem
 perature of the equator are derived from the sun ; consequently
 as the poles receive from the sun only -j5^ of this amount of
 temperature, or 133°, this will give merely 186° as the dif
 ference which ought to exist between the equator and the
 poles. There is, however, good reason for believing that the
 temperature of space is far less than that assigned by Pouillet
and Herschel—that, in fact, it is probably not far above absolute
zero. Therefore by adopting so high a temperature as —239°
we make the difference between the temperature of the equator
and that of the poles too small.
    Second, it was necessary to know at what rate the tempe
 rature increased or decreased with a given increase or decrease
 in the amount of heat received. It was well known that
 Newton's law—that the change of temperature was directly
proportionate to the change in the quantity of heat received—
 was far from being correct. The formula of Dulong and
 Petit was found to give results pretty accurate within ordinary
 limits of temperature. But it would not have done, in making
 my estimate, to take that formula, if I adopted Herschel's
 estimate of the temperature of space ; for it would have made
 the difference of temperature between the equator and the
 poles by far too small. Newton's law, if we adopt Herschel's
 estimate of the temperature of space, would give results much
 nearer the truth ; for the error of the one would, to a large
 extent at least, neutralize that of the other.
    From such uncertain data it was, of course, impossible to
arrive at results which could in any way be regarded as accu
 rate. But it so happens that perfect accuracy of results in the
present case was not essential : all that really was required
 was a rough estimate of what the difference of temperature
between the equator and the poles ought to be. The method
adopted showed pretty clearly, however, that the difference of
temperature could not be less (although probably more) than
200°; but the present actual difference does not probably ex
ceed 80°. We have no means of ascertaining with certainty
what the mean annual temperature of the poles is ; but as the
temperature of lat. 80° N. is 40-5, that of the poles is probably
not under 0°. If the present difference be 80°, it is then 120°
less than it would be did the temperature of each place depend
alone on the heat received directly from the sun. This great
reduction from about 200° to 80° can, of course, be duo to no
other cause than to a transference of heat from the equator to
the poles. The question then arose, by what means was this
transference effected ? There were only two agencies avail
able—the transference must be effected either by aerial or by

270                 Dr. J. Croll on the Cause of
ocean-currents. It was shown at considerable length (' Cli
mate and Time,' pp. 27-30, and other places) that the amount
of heat that can be conveyed from the equator to the poles
by means of aerial currents is trifling, and that, consequently,
the transference must be referred to the currents of the ocean.
 It became obvious then that the influence of ocean-currents in
the distribution of heat over the globe had been enormously
 underestimated. In order to ascertain with greater certainty
 that such had been the case, I resolved on determining, if pos
 sible, in absolute measure the amount of heat actually being
 conveyed from the equator to temperate and polar regions
 by means of ocean-currents.
    The only great current whose volume and temperature had
 been ascertained with any degree of certainty was the Gulf-
 stream. On computing the absolute amount of heat con
 veyed by that stream, it was found to be more than equal to
 all the heat received from the sun within 32 miles on each
 side of the equator. The amount of equatorial heat carried
 into temperate and polar regions by this stream alone is
 therefore equal to one fourth of all the heat received from the
 sun by the North Atlantic from the Tropic of Cancer up to
 the Arctic circle*. Although the heating-power of the Gulf-
 stream had long been known, yet no one had imagined that
 the warmth of our climate was due, to such an enormous extent,
 to the heat conveyed by that stream. The amount of heat
 received by an equatorial zone 64 miles in breadth repre
 sents, be it observed, merely the amount conveyed by one
 current alone. There are several other great currents some
 of which convey as much heat polewards as the Gulf-stream.
  On taking into account the influence of the whole system of
 oceanic circulation, it was not surprising that the difference of
 temperature between the equator and the poles should be
 reduced from 200° to 80°.
     From these considerations, the real cause of former com
  paratively mild climates in Arctic regions became now appa
  rent. All that was necessary to confer on, say, Greenland a
  condition of climate which would admit of the growth of a
  luxuriant vegetation was simply an increase in the amount of
 heat transferred from equatorial to Arctic regions by means
  of ocean-currents. And to effect this change of climate no
  very great amount of increase was really required ; for it was
  shown that the severity of the climate of that region was
  about as much due to the cooling effect of the permanent snow
  and ice as to an actual want of heat. An increase in the
  amount of warm water entering the Arctic Ocean, just sufti-

                         Mild Polar Climates.                   271
  cient to prevent the formation of permanent ice, was all that
  was really necessary ; for were it not for the presence of ice
 the summers of Greenland would be as warm as those of
 England.
     Were the whole of the warm water of the Gulf-stream at
 present to flow into the Arctic Ocean, it would probably re
 move the ice of Greenland. Any physical changes, such as
 those that have been discussed on former occasions, which
 would greatly increase the volume and temperature of the
 stream and deflect more of its waters into the Arctic Ocean
 would, there is little doubt, confer on the polar regions a
 climate suitable for plant and animal life. At present the
 Gulf-stream bifurcates in mid-Atlantic, one branch passing
 north-eastwards into the Arctic regions, whilst the larger
 branch turns south-eastwards by the Azores, and after passing
 the Canaries reenters the equatorial current. As the Gulf-
 stream, like other great currents of the ocean, follows almost
 exactly the path of the prevailing winds *, it bifurcates in mid-
 Atlantic simply because the winds blowing over it bifurcate
 also. Any physical change which would prevent this bifurca
 tion of the winds and cause them to blow north-eastwards
 would probably impel the whole of the Gulf-stream waters
 into the Arctic seas. All this doubtless might quite well be
 effected without any geographical changes, although changes
 in the physical geography of the North Atlantic might be
helpful.
    These considerations regarding the influence of the Gulf-
stream point to another result of an opposite character. It
is this : if a large increase in the volume and temperature of
the stream would confer on Greenland and the Arctic regions
a condition of climate somewhat like that of North-western
Europe, it is obvious, as has been shown at length on former
occasions, that a large decrease in its temperature and volume
would, on the other hand, lead to a state of things in North
western Europe approaching to that which now prevails in
Greenland. A decrease leads to a glacial, an increase to an
interglacial condition of things.
   Sir William Thomson on Mild Arctic Climates.—In a paper
read before the Geological Society of Glasgow in February
1877, Sir William maintains- also that an increase in the
amount of heat conveyed by ocean-currents to the Arctic
regions, combined with the effect of Clouds, Wind, and
Aqueous Vapour, is perfectly sufficient to account for the
warm and temperate condition of climate which is known to
                   * See 'Climate and Time,' p. 213.

272                 Dr. J. Croll on the Cause of
have prevailed in those regions during former epochs.            The
following quotations will show Sir William's views :—
   " A thousand feet of depression would submerge the continents
of Europe, Asia, and America, for thousands of mdes from their
present northern coast-lines ; and would give instead of the present
land-locked, and therefore ice-bound Arctic sea, an open iceless
ocean, with only a number of small steep islands to obstruct the
free interchange of water between the North Pole and temperate
or tropical regions. That the Arctic sea would, in such circum
stances, be free from ice quite up to the north pole may be, I think,
securely inferred from what, in the present condition of the globe,
we know of ice-bound and open seas in the northern hemisphere
and of the southern ocean abounding in icebergs, but probably
nowhere ice-bound up to the very coast of the circumpolar Ant
arctic continent, except in more or less land-locked bays
    " Suppose now the sea, unobstructed by land from either pole to
temperate or tropical regions, to be iceless at any time, would it
continue iceless during the whole of the sunless polar winter ?
Yes, we may safely answer. Supposing the depth of the sea to be
not les.s than 50 or 100 fathoms, and judging from what we know
for certain of ocean-currents, we may safely say that differences of
specific gravity of the water produced by difference of temperature
not reaching anywhere down to the freezing-point would cause
enough of circulation of water between the polar and temperate or
tropical regions to supply all the heat radiated from the water
within the Arctic circle during the sunless winter, if air contri
buted none of it. Just think of a current of three quarters of a
nautical mile per hour, or 70 miles per four days, flowing towards
the pole across the Arctic circle. The area of tho Arctic circle is
 700 square miles for each mile of its circumference. Hence 40
 fathoms deep of such a current would carry in, per twenty-four
hours, a little more than water enough to cover the whole area to
a depth of 1 fathom; and this, if 7°-l Cent, above the freezing-
 point, would bring in just enough of heat to prevent freezing, if in
twenty-four hours as much heat were radiated away as taken from
a tenth of a fathom of ice-cold water would leave it ice at the
freezing-point. This is no doubt much more than the actual
amount of radiation, and the supposed current is probably much
less than it would be if the water were ice-cold at the pole and
7° Cent, at the Arctic circle. Hence, without any assistance from,
air, we find in the convection of heat by water alone a sufficiently
powerful influence to prevent any freezing-up in polar regions at
any time of year." (Trans, of the Geol. Soc. of Glasgow, 22nd
February, 1877.)
    That an amount of warm water flowing into the Arctic
Ocean equal to that assumed by Sir William Thomson, along
with the effects of clouds, wind, dew, and other agencies to
which he refers, would wholly prevent the existence of per

                         Mild Polar Climates.                        273
manent ice in those regions, is a conclusion which, I think,
can hardly be doubted. It is with the greatest deference that
I venture to differ from so eminent a physicist ; but I am
unable to believe that such a transference of water from in
tertropical and temperate regions could be effected by the
agency to which he attributes it. Certainly the amount of
heat conveyed by means of a circulation resulting from dif
ference of specific gravity, produced by difference of tempera
ture, must be trifling when compared with that of ocean-
currents produced by the impelling force of the winds. Take,
for example, the case of the Gulf-stream. If the amount of
heat conveyed from intertropical regions into the North
Atlantic by means of difference of density resulting from dif
ference of temperature were equal to that conveyed by the
Gulf-stream, it would follow, as has been proved*, that the
Atlantic would be far warmer in temperate and arctic than
in intertropical regions. Taking the annual quantity of heat
received from the sun per unit surface at the equator as 1000,
the quantities received by the three zones would be respec
tively as follows :—
                   Equator                          1000
                   Torrid zone                        975
                   Temperate zone.      .   .   .     757
                   Frigid zone                        454
    Assume, then, that as much heat is conveyed from inter
 tropical regions into the Atlantic and Arctic seas by this cir
culation from difference of specific gravity as by the Gulf-
stream, and assume also that one half of the total heat con
veyed by the two systems of circulation goes to warm the
Arctic Ocean, and the other half remains in temperate
regions, the following would then be the relative quantities of
heat possessed by the three zones :—
                Atlantic in torrid zone . .         .   671
                    „     in temperate zone .       .   940
                    „     in frigid zone . .        .   766
    There is a still more formidable objection to the theory. It
has been demonstrated, from the temperature-soundings made
by the ' Challenger ' Expedition f, that the general surface of
the North Atlantic must, in order to produce equilibrium,
stand at a higher level than at the equator : in other words,

ber 1875 ; ' Nature,' November 25th, 1875.

274               Dr. J. Croll on the Cause of
the surface of the Atlantic is lowest at the equator, and rises
with a gentle slope to well nigh the latitude of England.
This curious condition of things is owing to the fact that, in
consequence of the enormous quantity of warm water from
intertropical regions which is being continually carried by the
Gulf-stream into temperate regions, the mean temperature of
the Atlantic water, considered from its surface to the bottom,
is greater, and the specific gravity less, in temperate regions
than at the equator. In consequence of this difference of
specific gravity, the surface of the Atlantic at latitude 23° N.
must stand 2 feet 3 inches above the level of the equator, and
at latitude 38° N. 3 feet 3 inches above the equator. In this
case it is absolutely impossible that there can bo a flow in the
Atlantic from the equatorial to the temperate regions result
ing from difference of specific gravity. If there is any motion
of the water from that cause, it must, in so far as the Atlantic
is concerned, be in the opposite direction, viz. from the tem
perate to the equatorial regions.
   All, or almost all, the heat which the Arctic seas receive
from intertropical regions in the form of warm water comes
from the Atlantic, and not from the Pacific ; for the amount
of warm water entering by Behring Strait must be compara
tively small. It therefore follows from the foregoing con
siderations that none of that equatorial heat can be conveyed
by a circulation resulting from difference of specific gravity
produced by difference of temperature.
   It is assumed as a condition in this theory that a submer
gence of the Arctic land of several hundred feet must have
taken place in order to convert that land into a series of
islands allowing of the free passage of water round them. But
the evidence of Geology, as was shown on a former occasion *,
is not altogether favourable to the idea that those warm cli
mates were in any way the result of a submergence of the
polar land. Take the Miocenee poch as an example : all the
way from Ireland and the Western Isles, by the Faroes, Ice
land, Franz-Joseph Land, to North Greenland, the Miocene
vegetation and the denuded fragmentary state of the strata
point to a much wider distribution of Polar land than that
which now obtains in those regions.
   Mr. Alfred R. Wallace on Mild Arctic Climates.—The theory
that the mild climates of Arctic regions were due to an inflow
of warm water from intertropical and temperate regions has
also been fully adopted by Mr. Alfred ft. Wallace. But,
unlike Sir William Thomson, he does not attribute this
                   • Geol. Mag;., September 1878.

                      Mild Polar Climates.                   275
transference of warm water to a circulation resulting from
difference of density produced by difference of temperature,
but to currents caused by the impelling force of the wind.
    Mr. Wallace shares in the opinion, now entertained by a vast
number of geologists, that during the whole of the Tertiary
period the climate of the north temperate and polar regions
was uniformly warm and mild, without a trace of any inter
vening epochs of cold. According to him there were no
glacial or interglacial periods during Tertiary times. In this
case he, of course, does not suppose that the inflow of warm
water into Arctic regions, on which the mild condition of cli
mate depended, was in any way due to those physical agencies
 which came into operation during an interglacial period. Mr.
Wallace accounts for the mild Arctic climate during the Ter
tiary period by the supposition that at that time there were
 probably several channels extending from equatorial to arctic
 regions through the eastern and western continents, allowing
 of a continuous flow of intertropical water into the Arctic
 Ocean.      Mr. Wallace expresses his views on the point
 thus :—
     " The distribution of the Eocene and Miocene formations
 shows that during a considerable portion of the Tertiary
 period an inland sea, more or less occupied by an archipelago
 of islands, extended across Central Europe between the Baltic
 and the Black and Caspian Seas, and thence by narrower
 channels south-eastward to the valley of the Euphrates and
 the Persian Gulf, thus opening a communication between the
 North Atlantic and the Indian Ocean. From the Caspian also
 a wide arm of the sea extended during some part of the
 Tertiary epoch northwards to the Arctic Ocean ; and there is
 nothing to show that this sea may not have been in existence
 during the whole Tertiary period. Another channel probably
 existed over Egypt into the eastern basin of the Mediterranean
 and the Black Sea; while it is probable that there was a com
 munication between the Baltic and the White Sea, leaving
  Scandinavia as an extensivo island. Turning to India, we find
  that an arm of the sea of great width and depth extended from
  the Bay of Bengal to the mouths of the Indus ; while the
  enormous depression indicated by the presence of marino
  fossils of Eocene age at a height of 16,500 feet in Western
  Tibet renders it not improbable that a more direct channel
  across Afghanistan may have opened a communication between
  the West-Asiatic and Polar seas." (' Island Life/ p. 184.)
     My acquaintance with the Tertiary formations of the globe,
  and with the distribution of land and water during that period,
 is not such as to enable me to form any opinion whatever

276               Dr. J. Croll on the Cause 0/
either as to the probability or to the improbability of the
existence of such channels as are assumed by Mr. Wallace.
Bat, looking at the question from a physical point of view, it
seems to me pretty evident that if such channels as he sup
poses existed, allowing of a continuous flow of equatorial
water into the Arctic seas, it would certainly prevent tho
formation of permanent ice around the pole, and would doubt
less confer on the arctic regions a mild and equable climate.
This would be more particularly the cnse if, as Mr. Wallace
supposes, owing to geographical conditions, far more of the
equatorial water was deflected into the Arctic than into the
Antarctic regions.
   But at the same time I think it is just as evident that
these channels would not neutralize the effects resulting from
a high state of eccentricity. It may be quite true that the
physical cause brought into operation during a high state of
eccentricity might not be sufficient to reduce the quantity of
warm water flowing into the Arctic Ocean to an extent that
would permit of the formation of permanent ice around
the pole, but it certainly would greatly diminish the flow
into the Arctic Ocean. Supposing that at the commence
ment of the last glacial epoch the volume of the Gulf-stream
was double what it is at present; this condition of things
¦would not have prevented the operation of those physical
agents which brought about the glacial epoch, although it,
no doubt, would have considerably modified the severity of
the glaciation resulting from their operation. The very
same thing would hold true, though perhaps in a much
greater degree, in reference to the channels assumed by Mr.
Wallace.
   If the emissive power of the sun was about the same
during tho Tertiary period as at present, and there is no
good grounds for supposing it was otherwise, then the
extra heat possessed by the northern temperate and arctic
regions must have been derived either from tho equatorial
regions or from the southern hemisphere, or, what is more
likely, from both. If so, then the temperature either of the
southern hemisphere or of the intertropical regions, or both,
must have been much lower during the Tertiary period than
at tho present day. A lowering of the temperature of the
equatorial regions, resulting from this transference of heat,
would tend to produce a more equable and uniform condition
of climate over the whole of the northern hemisphere. As the
area of the Arctic Ocean is small in comparison to that of the
equatorial zone, from which the warm water was derived, the
fall of temperature at the equator would be much less than tho

                       Mild Polar Climates.                   277
rise at the pole. Supposing there had been a rise of, say, 30°
at the pole resulting from a fall of 10° at the equator (and this
is by no means an improbable assumption), this would reduce
the difference between the equator and the pole by 40°, or to
half its present amount. We should then have a climatic con
dition pretty much resembling that which is known to have
prevailed during at least considerable portions of the Tertiary
period.
    It is indeed very doubtful if such a climatic condition of
things as that could be brought about by a high state of eccen
tricity with the present distribution of land and water ; but, on
the other hand, it is just as doubtful whether the channels of
 communication assumed by Mr. Wallace could have brought
it about without the aid of eccentricity.
    The very existence of so high a temperature on the northern
 hemisphere during Tertiary times may be regarded as strong
 presumptive proof that the geographical conditions obtaining
 on the southern hemisphere were most unfavourable to the
 flow of intertropical water into that hemisphere. This may
 be one of the reasons why a high state of eccentricity failed
 to produce a well-marked glacial epoch on the northern hemi
 sphere, the geographical conditions preventing a transference
 of warm water into the southern hemisphere sufficient to pro
  duce true glaciation on the opposite hemisphere. That the
 geographical conditions obtaining on the southern hemisphere
 during Tertiary times were probably of such a character is an
 opinion advanced by Mr. Wallace himself. " There are," he
  says, " many peculiarities in the distribution of plants and of
  some groups of animals in the southern hemisphere, which
  render it almost certain that there has sometimes been a
  greater extension of the antarctic lands during Tertiary times ;
  and it is therefore not improbable that a more or less glaci
  ated condition may have been a long-persistent feature of
  the southern hemisphere, due to the peculiar distribution of
  land and sea, which favours the production of ice-fields and
  glaciers" (p. 192).
     Influences of Eccentricity during the Tertiary Period.—This
  being the state of things on tho southern hemisphere, the
  glacial condition of the hemisphere, when its winter solstice
  was in aphelion, would tend in a powerful manner to impel
  the warm water of the south over on the northern hemisphere,
  and thus raise its temperature. This, again, is a view which
  has also been urged by Mr. Wallace. " Though high eccen
  tricity would," he remarks, " not directly modify the mild
  climates produced by the state of the northern hemisphere
  which prevailed during Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene

 278                 Dr. J. CroU on the Cause of
 times *, it might indirectly affect it by increasing the mass
 of antarctic ice, and thus increasing the force of the trade-
 winds and the resulting northward-flowing warm currents.
 .... And as we have seen that during the last three
 million years the eccentricity has been almost always much
 higher than it is now, we should expect that the quantity of
 ice in the southern hemisphere will usually have been greater,
 and will thus have tended to increase the force of those oceanic
 currents which produce the mild climates of the northern
 hemisphere " (p. 192).
    There is little doubt but that the climate of the Tertiary-
 period was greatly affected by eccentricity ; but, owing to the
 difference in the geographical conditions of the two hemi
 spheres, eccentricity would exercise a much greater influence
 on the climatic condition of the northern hemisphere when
 the northern winter solstice was in perihelion than it would
 do when it was in aphelion. Owing to the difference in
 the conditions of the two hemispheres, the physical agents
 brought into operation by a high state of eccentricity would
 act more powerfully in impelling the equatorial waters
 towards the Arctic regions when the winter solstice was in
 perihelion than they would do in impelling the water towards
 the Antarctic regions when the solstice was in aphelion. In
 this case the northern hemisphere would be heated to a greater
 extent when its winter solstice was in perihelion than it would
 be cooled when the solslice was in aphelion. It is this cir
 cumstance which, I think, has misled geologists, and induced
 them to conclude that because the physical agents brought
 into operation when the winter solstice was in aphelion,
 during a high state of eccentricity, failed to produce a well-
 marked glacial epoch in Tertiary times, consequently the
 climatic condition of that period was not much affected by
 eccentricity.
    It would seem to be owing to that peculiar difference be
 tween the conditions of the two hemispheres that, even during
 high eccentricity, the physical agents in operation when the
 winter solstice was in aphelion were unable to lower the tem
 perature of the northern hemisphere to an extent sufficient to
 cover high temperate and arctic regions with permanent ice ;
 but for this very same reason these agents would be enabled
 to raise the temperature to an extent exceptionally high when
 the winter solstice was in perihelion. In other words, this
 verv combination of circumstances, which so much modified
   • High eccentricity might not directly modify the mild climates, hut
certainly the physical agents brought into operation by the high eccen
tricity would do so.

and equability of what may be called tbe Tertiary warm

   Climate of the Tertiary Period, in no far as affected by
Eccentricity. —If the foregoing conclusions are correct, the
following would then seem to be the probable character of
the climate of the Tertiary period, in so far as that climate
was affected by eccentricity. As is truly remarked by Mr.
Wallace, the eccentricity during the past throe million years
has been almost always much higher than it is now. It will
consequently follow that very considerable portions of the
Tertiary age would consist of alternate comparatively cold and
exceedingly warm and equable periods. These may be said
to correspond to the cold and warm periods of the glacial
epoch ; but, of course, they could in no sense be called glacial
and interglacial periods ; for the cold of the cold periods
would not be such as to produce permanent ice, while the heat
and equability of the warm periods would far exceed that of
 the interglacial periods.
    Evidence of such Alternations of Climate.—That such oscilla
 tions occurred during the Tertiary period seems to be borne
 out by the facts of geology and paleontology. Mr. J. Starkie
 Gardner, a geologist who has had great experience in the fossil
 flora of the Tertiary deposits, says that such alternating
 warmer and colder conditions are supported by strong negative
 and some positive evidence, found not only in English Eocene,
 but in all Tertiary beds throughout the world. In the Lower
 Bagshot of Hampshire have been found, he states, feather-
 and fan-palms, Dryandra, beech, maple, Azalea, laurel, elm,
 acacia, aroids, cactus, ferns, conifers, Stenocarpus, and plants
 of the pea tribe, together with many others. The question
 which presents itself to one's mind, he remarks, is, how is it
 possible that the tropical forms, such as the palms, aroids,
 cactus, &c, could have grown alongside of the apparently
 temperate forms, such as the oak, elm, beech, and others?
 Mr. Gardner's explanation is as follows : —
    " Astronomers, having calculated the path of the revolution of
 the earth in ages past, tell us that in recurring periods each hemi
 sphere, northern and southern, has been successively subject to
 repeated cyclical changes in temperature. There have been for the
 area which is now England mauy alternations of long periods of
 heat aud cold. Whenever the area became warmer, the descendants
 of semitropical forms would gradually creep further and further
 north, whilst the descendants of cold-loving plants would retreat
 from the advancing temperature, vice versa. Whenever the area

   280                 Dr. J. Oroll on the Came of
  became gradually colder, the heat-loving plants would, from one
  generation to another, retreat further and further south, whilst the
  cold-loving plants would return to the area from which their
  ancestors had been driven out. In each case there would be some
  lingering remnants of the retreating vegetation (though perhaps
  existing with diminished vigour) growing alongside of the earliest
  arrivals of the incoming vegetation.
     " Such is a possible explanation of our finding these plant-remains
  commingled together. It must be borne in mind that it is not so
  much the mean temperature of a whole year which affects the pos
  sibility of plants growing in any locality, as the fact of what are
  the extremes of summer and winter temperature "*.
     This is precisely the explanation given by the commingling
  of subtropical and arctic floras and faunas of deposits belonging
  to the glacial epoch. The causation in the two cases was in
  fact the same in principle, differing only in the conditions
  under which it operated. In the caso of the glacial epoch the
  cold periods were intensely severe and the warm periods but
 moderately hot ; whereas in regard to the Tertiary cold
 periods they were but moderately cool, and the warm periods
 exceedingly hot.
     Mr. Wallace, who refers to Mr. Gardner's views approv
 ingly, says :—" In the case of marine faunas it is more diffi
 cult to judge, but the numerous changes in the fossil remains
 from bed to bed, only a few feet and sometimes a few inches
 apart, may be sometimes due to change of climate ; and when
 it is recognized that such changes have probably occurred
 at all geological epochs, and their effects are systematically
 searched for, many peculiarities in the distribution of or
 ganisms through the different members of one deposit may
 be traced to this cause"t-
    To prevent having thus to admit the existence of alternate
 warmer and colder periods during Tertiary times, Mr. Searles
 V. Wood, Juu., proposed another theory, which, stated in his
 own words, is the following :—
    " The remains upon which the determinations of this flora have
been based are drifted, and not those of a bed in situ like the coal-
seams, and the whole of the Hampshire Eocene is connected with
the delta of a great river which persisted throughout the accumula
tion of the various beds, which aggregate to upwards of 2000 feet
in thickness. This river evidently flowed from the west, through
a district of which the low ground had a tropical climate ; but like
some tropical rivers of the present day, such as the Brahmaputra,
the Megna, the Ganges, &c., it was probably fed by tributaries

 flowing from a mountain-region supporting zones of vegetation of
 all kinds from the tropical to the Arctic, if during the Eocene
 period vegetation such as the present Arctic had come into existence,
 of which we have as yet no evidence. Torrential floods may have
 swept the remains of vegetation from the temperate zones of this
 region into tributaries that conveyed it into the main river before
 it was decayed or water-logged, where it became intermingled with
 the remains of vegetation which grew in the tropical low ground
 skirting the main stream, so that both sank together into the same
 mud and silt "*.
    The elevated mountain regions from which he supposes
 these temperate forms were derived he thinks might have been
 Mull, 400 miles N.N.W., and Wales 200 miles N.W. Mr.
 Gardner, however, showed most conclusively that Mr. Wood's
theory was based on imperfect acquaintance with the conditions
 of the problem. The following is Mr. Gardner's reply :—
    " The leaves have never been drifted from afar ; they are often
still adhering to the twigs. The leaves are flat and perfect, rarely
even rolled and crumpled, as dry leaves may be, if falling on a
muddy surface ; still more rarely have they fallen edgeways and
been imbedded vertically. They are, moreover, not variously mixed,
as they should be if they had been carried for any distance, but are
found in local groups of species. For example, all the leaves of
 Castunea have been found in one clay patch, with Iriartea and
 OUicJienia ; none of these have been found elsewhere. A trilobed
leaf is peculiar to Studland ; the Alum Bay Aralia, the peculiar
form of Protectees, the great Ficus, and other leaves occur at Alum
Bay only. Each little patch at Bournemouth is characterized by
its own peculiar leaves. Such a distribution can only result from
the proximity of the trees from which the leaves have fallen. The
forms of most temperate aspect are best preserved, so that to be
logically applied, the Drift theory requires the palms, etc., to have
been drifted upwards. To suppose that most delicate leaves could
have been brought by torrents 400 miles from Mull or 200 miles
from Wales, and spread out horizontally in thousands, without
crease or crumple, on the coast of Hampshire, may be a feasible
theory to Mr. Searles V. Wood, jun., but will not recommend
itself to the majority of thinkers " t.
    Were (here Glacial Epochs during the Tertiary Age?—Many
geologists, especially amongst those who are opposed to the
theory of recurring glacial epochs, answer this question em
phatically in the negative. This belief as to the non-existence
of glacial conditions during the Tertiary period is, of course,
based wholly on negative evidence ; and this negative evidence
though strong is by no means perfectly conclusive, and
certainly not worthy of the weight which has been placed

 282                 Dr. J. Croll on the Cause of
 upon it.      In Chap. xvii. of ' Climate and Time ' I have
 endeavoured to show that although much has been written on
 the imperfection of geological records, yet the imperfection of
 thoso records in regard to past glacial epochs has not received
the attention which it really deserves.
    It must be borne in mind, however, that it does not follow
 from the Physical Theory of Secular changes of Climate, that
 because the eccentricity may have been high at some parti
 cular period there must necessarily have been a glacial epoch.-
 The erroneous nature of this misapprehension of the theory
has already been shown at considerable length *. Eccentri
 city can produce glaciation only through means of physical
agencies, and for the operation of these agencies a certain
geographical condition of things is absolutely necessary. We
know with certainty that during the Tertiary period the
eccentricity was at times exceptionally high, as, for example,
2,500,000 and 850,000 years ago ; but whether a glacial epoch
occurred at these periods depended, of course, upon whether
or not the necessary geographical conditions then obtained.
Supposing the necessary geographical conditions for glaciation
did exist at the two periods in question, still if those condi
tions differed very much from those which now obtain, the
glacial state of things then produced would certainly differ
from that of the last glacial epoch. This is obvious, for the
same physical agencies acting under very different conditions
would not produce the same effects. Under almost any geo
graphical condition of things eccentricity would produce
marked effects, but the effects produced might not amount to
glaciation. In the Tertiary age, during high eccentricity, the
effects resulting might possibly have been as well marked as
they were during the glacial epoch ; but these effects must
have differed very much from those produced at that epoch.
We have seen that, owing to that peculiar geographical condi
tion of things existing during the Tertiary period, the physical
agents brought into operation by a high state of eccentricity
would have a much greater influence in raising the tempera
ture of the northern hemisphere when the winters occurred
in perihelion, than they would have in lowering the tempera
ture of that hemisphere when the winters were in aphelion.
At the periods 2,500,000 and 850,000 years ago, for example,
those physical agents would no doubt produce quite a tropical
condition of climate in high northern latitudes when the
winters were in perihelion, while it is quite probable they
may not have been able to produce glaciation when the
winters were in aphelion. It is more than likely that the

                     Mild Polar Climates.                     283
tropical nature of the climate during portions of the Tertiary
period was due not so much to that peculiar distribution of
land and water existing then, as it was to the fact that this
peculiar distribution enabled the physical agents in operation
during a high state of eccentricity to impel a vastly greater
amount of warm intertropical water into the temperate and
Arctic seas than they could have done under the present geo
graphical condition of things.
   Those very same geographical conditions enabling the
physical agents to raise the temperature exceptionally high
during the warm periods would, on the other hand, prevent
them from being able to lower the temperature exceptionally
low during the alternate cold periods. Nevertheless, I think
it probable that at the two periods referred to, when the
eccentricity was much greater than it was during the glacial
epoch, the temperature would be lowered to an extent that
would produce glaciation, although the glaciation might not
perhaps approach in severity to any thing like that of the
glacial epoch. The negative evidence which has been adduced
against the existence of such glacial conditions during the
Tertiary period is certainly far from being conclusive.
   The opinion is concurred in by Mr. Wallace that the Table of
Eccentricity for the past three million years, given in ' Climate
and Time,' probably includes the greater part, if not the whole,
of the Tertiary period. He states that during the 2,400,000
years preceding the last glacial epoch there were, according
to the table, no fewer than sixteen separate epochs when the
eccentricity reached or exceeded twice its present amount.
But it does not follow, according to the Physical Theory, that
there ought, on that account, to have been sixteen epochs of
more or less glaciation. Whether such ought to have been
the case or not would depend on whether or not the geogra
phical conditions were the same during these epochs as they
were at the glacial epoch, a thing regarding which the theory
is not responsible. The question is not were there sixteen
glacial epochs during the Tertiary period, but were there any ?
Even granted that those channels assumed by Mr. Wallace
did exist, they would not, I feel assured, wholly prevent gla
ciation taking place at the two periods to which reference
has been made, although the glaciation might not be severe.
   In support of the opinion that there is no evidence of
glaciation during the Tertiary period, Mr. Wallace quotes the
views of Mr. Searles V. Wood, Jun., on the subject. Mr. Wood
states that the Eocene formation is complete in England, and
is exposed in continuous section along the north coast of the
Isle of Wight and along the northern coast of Kent from
                               U2

284                Dr. J. Croll on the Cause of
its base to the Lower Bagshot Sand. It has, he says, been
intersected by cuttings in all directions and at all horizons,
but has not yielded a trace of any thing indicating a cold and
glacial condition of things. The same, ho adds, holds true of
the strata, in France and Belgium. Further, " the Oligocene
of Northern Germany and Belgium, and the Miocene of those
countries and of France, have also afforded a rich molluscan
fauna, which, like that of the Eocene, has as yet presented no
indication of the intrusion of any thing to interfere with its
uniformly subtropical character."
   In reply to all this it may be stated that the simple absence
of any trace of glaciation in the Tertiary deposits of the south
of England certainly cannot be regarded as conclusive
against the existence of an epoch of glaciation during that
period. Not many years ago geologists denied that there
was any evidence to be found of glaciation in the south of
England, and at the present time there are hundreds of geo
logists who will not admit that that part was ever overridden
by land-ice. If it is so difficult to find in that quarter
evidence of the last glacial epoch, severe as that glacial epoch
was, we need not wonder that no trace of glaciation so remote
as that of the Eocene period is now to be seen. Besides all
this, there is in the south of England the land-surface on
which the glaciation, if any, took place, whereas not a vestige
of the old land-surfaces of the Eocene period now remains.
It therefore seems to me that the mere fact of nothing as yet
having been found in the Tertiary deposits of the south of
England, indicating one or more cold periods, is no proof that
there may not possibly have been such periods, and even of
 considerable severity.- The same remarks hold equally true
 in regard to the deposits on the continent referred to by
 Mr. Wood.
    It will be urged in reply that there is one kind of evidence
 which ought to be found, as it could not possibly have been
 obliterated by the destruction of the Tertiary land-surfaces :
 that is, the presence of erratic blocks and foreign rock-frag
 ments imbedded in the strata. Mr. Wallace states that in the
 many thousand feet in thickness of alternate clays, sands,
 marls, shales, and limestones no irregular blocks of foreign
 material or boulders characteristic of glacial conditions are to
 be found. The same, ho says, holds equally true of the
 extensive Tertiary deposits of temperate North America.
    If it be really the case that the Tertiary beds are wholly
 without boulders or fragments of foreign material, then this
 certainly may be regarded as proof that no real glacial epoch
 could have occurred during that period. But has it been

                      Mild Polar Climates.                    285
satisfactorily ascertained that those beds are wholly devoid of
such materials ? Those beds, I presume, have been searched
by geologists for their fossil contents rather than for strati-
grapbical evidence of glacial epochs. It is remarkable how
long the evidence of glaciation sometimes remains unobserved
when no special attention is devoted to the matter. As
examples of this, wo know with certainty that the Orkney
and Shetland Islands were during the glacial epoch over
ridden by land-ice; and yet geologists who had often visited
these islands declared that they bore no marks of glaciation.
So recently as 1875 the low grounds of Northern Germany
were believed to be without glacial striae ; yet when German
geologists began to turn their attention specially to the subject,
they found not only evidence of glaciation but indisputable
proof that during the glacial epoch the great Scandinavian
ice-sheet had advanced over the country no fewer than three
separate times down to the latitude of Berlin. I have myself
seen the striated summit of a mountain on which geologists
had been treading for years without observing the ice-
 markings under tlieir feet. The reason why these markings
 so long escaped detection is doubtless due to the fact that
they were on a spot which no geologist supposed that land-
ice could have reached. For this very same reason the fact
 remained so long unobserved that the low-lying ground of
Caithness had been glaciated by land-ice from Scandinavia,
filling the entire Baltic and the North Sea. Many similar
cases might be adduced where the marks of glaciation re
 mained long unobserved, either because no special search had
been made for them, or because they were under conditions in
which they were not expected to be found. It is very probable
that when the Tertiary deposits are carefully examined, with
the special object of ascertaining whether or not they contain
evidence of glaciation, geologists may be led to a different
conclusion regarding the supposed uniformly warm character
of the climate of that period. They may possibly find that, after
 all, the Tertiary beds do contain boulders and foreign material,
indicating the existence of glacial conditions during the period.
    Considerable importance has been attached to the statement
of Professor Nordenskjold that he failed to observe in the
stratified deposits of Greenland and Spitzbergen any evi
dence whatever of former glaciation in those regions. " We
have never seen," he says, " in Spitzbergen nor in Green
land, in these sections often many miles in length, and
including, one may say, all formations from the Silurian to
the Tertiary, any boulders even as large as a child's head.
There is not the smallest probability that strata of any con

 286               Dr. J. Croll on the Cattsc of
 siderable extent, containing boulders, are to be found in tbe
 polar tracts previous to the middle of the Tertiary period.
 Both an examination of the geognostic condition and an
 investigation of the fossil flora and fauna of the polar lands,
show no signs of a glacial era having existed in those parts
before the termination of the Miocene period "*. That Prof.
 Nordenskjold may not have seen in those strata boulders
 larger than a child's head may be perfectly true, but that
there actually are none is a thing utterly incredible. Still
 more incredible, however, is the conclusion which he draws
from this absence of boulders, viz. that from the Silurian down
to the termination of the Miocene period no glacial condition
of things existed either in Greenland or in Spitzbergen.
Both these places are at present in a state of glaciation ; and
were it not, as we have seen, for the enormous quantity of
heat which is being transferred from the equatorial regions
by the Gulf-stream, not only Greenland and Spitzbergen,
but the whole of the Arctic regions would be far more under
ice than they are. A glacial state of things is the normal
condition of polar regions ; and if at any time, as during the
Tertiary age, the Arctic regions were free from snow and ice,
it could only be in consequence of some peculiar distribution
of land and water and other exceptional conditions. That
this peculiar combination of circumstances should ha ve existed
during the whole of that immense lapse of time between the
Silurian and the close of the Tertiary period is certainly im
probable in the highest degree. In short, that Greenland
during the whole of that time should have been free from
snow and ico is as improbable, although perhaps not so phy
sically impossible, as that the interior of that continent should
at the present day be free from ice and covered with luxuriant
vegetation. Perhaps the same skill and indomitable perse
verance which proved the one conclusion to be erroneous may
yet one day prove the other to be also equally erroneous.
   Professor Nordenskjold does not appear to believe in
alternations of climate even in temperate regions, for he
says, " from palaeontological science no support can be ob
tained for the assumption of a periodical alternation of warm
and cold climates on the surface of the earth."
   Evidence of Glaciation during the Tertiary Period. —
Evidence of glaciation during the Miocene period is, I
think, aftbrdei by the well-known conglomerates and erratics
near Turin, first described by M. Gastaldi. Beds of Miocene
sandstone and conglomerate, with an intercalated deposit
containing large angular blocks of greenstone and limestone,
                • 'Geological Magazine,' 1875, p. 531.

                       Mild Polar Climates.                    287
have been found. Some of these blocks are of immense size.
Many of the stones in the deposit are polished and. striated in
a manner similar to those found in the boulder-clay of this
country. It has been shown by Gastaldi that these blocks
have all been derived from the outer ridge of the Alps on the
 Italian side, namely from the range extending from Ivrea
to the Lago Maggiore, and, consequently, they must have
travelled from twenty to eighty miles. So abundant are these
large blocks that extensive quarries have been opened in tho
hills for the sake of procuring them. The stratification of
the beds amongst which tho blocks occur sufficiently indicates
aqueous action and tho former presence of the sea. That
glaciers from the southern Alps actually reached to the sea
and sent adrift their icebergs over what, are now the sunny
plains of Northern Italy, is" proof that during that cold period
the climate must have been very severe. One remarkable
circumstance, indicating not only the glacial condition of the
bed in which the blocks occur, but also that this glaciation
was the result of eccentricity, is the fact that the bed is wholly
destitute of organic remains, while they are found abundantly
both in the underlying and overlying beds.
   Evidence of glaciation during the Eocene period, as is also
well known, is found in tho " Flysch " of Switzerland. On
the north side of the Alps, from Switzerland to Vienna, and
also near Genoa, there is a sandstone a few thousand feet in
thickness, containing enormous blocks of Oolitic limestone
and granite. Many of these blocks are upwards of 10 feet in
length, and one at Halekeren, near the Lake of Thun, is 105
feet long, 90 feet broad, and 45 feet in thickness. The block
is of a granite of a peculiar kind which cannot be matched
anywhere in the Alps. Similar blocks are found in beds of
the same age in the Apennines and in the Carpathians. The
glacial origin of this deposit is further evinced by the fact
that it is wholly destitute of organic remains. One circum
stance, which indicates that this glaciation was duo to eccen
tricity, is the fact that the strata most nearly associated with
the " Flysch" are rich in Echinoderms of the Spatanyus family,
which have a decided tropical aspect. This is what we ought,
of course, a prion, to expect if the glaciation was the result of
eccentricity, for the more severe a cold period of a glacial
epoch is, the warmer will be the periods which immediately
precede and succeed.
   Some writers endeavour to account for those glacial phe
nomena, without any reference to tho influence of high
eccentricity, by the assumption that the Alps were much
more elevated during the Tertiary period than they are at

288            On the Cause of Mild Polar Climates.
the present day. If we, however, adopt this explanation, we
shall have to assume that the Alps were suddenly elevated at
the time when the bed containing the erratics began to be
deposited, and that they were as suddenly lowered when the
deposition of the bed came to a close—a conclusion certainly
very improbable. Had the lowering of the Alps been effected
by the slow processes of denudation, it must have taken a
long course of ages to have lowered them to the extent of
bringing the glacial state to a close. In this case there
ought to be a succession of beds indicating the long continu
ance of cold conditions. Instead of this, however, we have a
glacial bed immediately preceded and succeeded by beds
indicating an almost tropical condition of climate. When
we take this circumstance into consideration, along with the
evidence adduced by Mr. J. S. Gardner as to tbe alternations
of warmer and colder conditions in tbe south of England and
other parts of Europe during the Eocene period, the convic
tion is forced upon us that a high state of eccentricity is the
most rational explanation of these curious phenomena.
   The greater elevation of the Alps would undoubtedly in
tensify the glacial condition of things, but it would not
originate it. The elevated character of the Alps, for example,
was no doubt the reason why the plains of Switzerland, during
the last glacial epoch, were so much more buried under ice than
other parts of Southern Europe; but their elevation was not that
which brought about the glaciation, for those plains were free
from ice both before and after the glacial epoch, though the
Alps were no doubt as high as they were during the ice-period.
   If we adopt the theory that these glacial conditions were
due to eccentricity, then we have, as 1 endeavoured to show
many years ago *, a clue to the probable absolute date of the
Middle Eocene and the Upper Miocene periods. There were,
as we have seen, two epochs during the Tertiary period when
the eccentricity was exceptionally high, viz. 2,500,000 years
ago and 850,000 years ago. The former might probably be
the date of the "Flysch" of the Eocene formation, and the
latter the date of the period when the Miocene erratics were
deposited in the icy sea near Turin.
   Some geologists have maintained that the climatic conditions
of the Tertiary period are utterly hostile to the Physical
Theory of Secular changes of Climate. The very reverse,
however, is the case; for, as we have seen, several of the
facts of Tertiary climate can be explained on no other prin
ciple than that of the theory.
   1 shall next consider the facts bearing on Arctic Inter-
glacial Periods.

   XXXIV. On the Amount of the Atmospheric Absorption.
                      By S. P. Langley*.
THE earth is surrounded by an absorbing atmosphere, and
      we never see the sun or the stars except through it.
   When we wish to know what the absolute brightness of
the sun or of a star is, we must first ask what the degree
and kind of this absorption has been, and must add to the
directly observed quantities of light the amount that the
atmosphere has taken away. Accordingly, every one engaged
in such researches must determine in explicit or implicit
terms for himself, or take on trust through another, the
amount of the absorption, wbich there is great unanimity
in fixing at about 20 per cent, of the whole (at the sea-
levcl). Thus the earliest observations in tho last century
give the light-absorption as 19 per cent. The very elaborate
ones by Seidel of Munich give 21 per cent., those by
Pritchard at Oxford 21 per cent. ; the most recent, by
Mueller, at Potsdam, 17 per cent. ; while the observations by
Pouillet on the sun's heat give 18 to 24 per cent. ; and
almost all of a great number which could be cited, whether
on light or heat, give about 20 per cent. It has indeed been
recognized of late years that the "light "-rays are, on the
whole, more absorbable than those of " heat," and that, in
particular, blue light is much more so ; but the difference
 between the mean coefficients of " light " and " heat," as
 found by the usual methods, is so small that we may here
 continue to speak of this " light "-absorption of 20 per cent,
 as closely applicable (in common estimation) to heat also.
 Thus, the very careful series of Ericsson on the sun's heat
 gives about 21 per cent. In fact, many thousands of obser
 vations by scores of observers, during the past and present
 century, seem to have determined this proportion with all
 the exactness of which it is capable.
    I have arrived at a result so wholly different that, in the
 face of such authority, I almost hesitate to announce it ; for
 I have been forced to the conclusion that all these determi
 nations are in error, and not in some small degree, but by
 a quantity probably at least equal to the total amount in
 question.
    I hasten to say, that I do not dispute the general accuracy
 of the numerous skilful investigators of known repute who
 have made these determinations, but that I dissent from the
 method in almost universal use for reducing them ; for since
 it is certain that none of these observers nave been outside

 the atmosphere to see what the radiation really is, all of
 them, however skilful, must depend on inference to determine
 what it would be, if they could thus observe it. It is certain
 that nearly all have used a formula of which it seems capable
 of absolute demonstration that it is not only erroneous, but
 that its error always lies in one direction, so as to invariably
 make the calculated absorption too small ; and it may be
 further shown, with an evidence which seems little less than
 demonstrative, that the numerical value of the error is very
 large in relation to the quantities involved.
    I have been led, however, not by theoretical considerations
 alone, but by experimental investigation (during the course
 of which I have observed both near the sea-level and at great
 altitudes), to the conclusion that the laws under which solar
 and stellar light and heat are absorbed by the atmosphere
 are so complex that their complete comprehension is still
 beyond our power, but that we may at least now improve
 our present ways of studying them ; for investigators have,
 however skilful in their observations, commonly ignored the
 complexity of the problem of their reduction, and, assuming
that it is as simple as we could wish it to be, have proceeded
 to compute the result by such a formula as would be most
convenient for us, if nature would follow. Thus, owing to a
natural tendency to accept as sufficient any scientific dogma
which has respectable sponsors and which saves labour, the
 simple rule, established over a century ago by Bouguer, and
 consecrated by the use of Herschel and Pouillet, to whom it
embodied all the knowledge of their time, is commonly used
by us to-day ; though we may easily be convinced that it has
ceased to express the facts known to us.
    To justify this language, let us consider what the problem
appears to be at first glance, and what the first suggestion is
 for solving it. If a beam of sunlight enters through a crevice
in a dark room, the light is partly interrupted by the particles
of dust or mist in the air, the apartment is visibly illuminated
by the light laterally reflected or diffused from them, and the
direct beam, having lost something by this process, is not so
bright after it has crossed the room as before. In common
language, the direct light, to an observer in the path of the
beam, has been partly " absorbed," and the problem is, to
determine in what degree. If a certain portion of the light
(suppose one filth) was thus scattered, the beam after it
crossed the room would be but four fifths as bright as when
it entered it ; and, if we were to trace the now diminished
beam through a second apartment altogether like the other,
it seems at first reasonable to suppose that the same propor

                  of the Atmospheric Absorption.               291
tion (i. e. four fifths of the remainder) would be transmitted
there also, and that the light would be the same kind of light
as before, and only diminished in amount (in the proportion
£ x ^). The assumption originally made by Bouguer* and
followed by Herschel and Pouillet, was, that it was in this
manner that the solar beat was absorbed by our atmosphere,
and that by assuming such a simple progression the original
heat could be calculated. (The minute expenditure of energy
in the actual warming of the air is of course to be included.)
    Let us (to repeat Bouguer's reasoning) divide in imagina
tion any homogeneous absorbing medium into successive
strata of identical thickness and chemical constitution.
   Let A be a source of radiant heat or light whose intensity
is reduced by passage through the first stratum to (let us
suppose) a fraction of the original represented by p, so that
what was A becomes Ap. Then, since the second stratum
is identical with the first in constitution and amount, and
must (it is assumed) have an identical effect, it will, on
Bouguer's hypothesis, transmit p of what enters it, and Apz
will emerge from the second, and so on, the fraction p trans
mitted by the unit of thickness (the " coefficient of transmis
sion ") being evidently the common ratio of a geometrical
progression, so that if the original heat be A, the amount of
heat after passing through e strata will be Ap', and the amount
 transmitted at any point will be proportional to the ordinate
 of a logarithmic curve.
   To apply this to the estimate of the heat, outside the atmo
sphere (j. e. before absorption), let SJ be a small portion of
E                           r                 C              K

the earth's surface, and EK the upper surface of the atmo
sphere, which is here supposed to be of uniform density and
constitution. (The effects of the actually unequal density of
successive strata can, it is assumed, be calculated and allowed
for.) Let S be the observer's station, then ES would be tbo
direction of a rav where the sun is in the zenith ; and, to fix
our ideas, letFS = 2ES, GS = 3 ES, KS = 4ES, &c. The
             * Boiiguer, ' TraM de la lumiire,' Paris, 1760.

292              Mr. S. P. Langley on the Amount
original heat A would become Ap after passing through one
stratum (ES) ; and, according to what has been assumed, it
would become (when the sun's zenith distance became ESF)
Ap2 after absorption by the two strata between F and S, Ap3
after absorption by the three strata between G and S, &c. A,
the original heat, and p, the coefficient of transmission, are
unknown ; but if we make an observation of the heat actually
reaching S along FS (let us call this heat m), and again later
in the day along KS (calling this second observed quantity
n), we have in the particular case supposed
                    Ap' — m,            Ap3 = n,
whence A and p both become known. Designating the
number of strata by e and the observed value (in or n) by t,
we have then Ap° = t ; the exponential formula of Pouilietand
later investigators. Its fundamental (and erroneous) assump
tion is, that the coefficient of transmission (p) is a constant.
   It is no doubt true that a very sensible portion of the
solar rays is scattered by an analogous process in our atmo
sphere ; but we have in our present knowledge to consider
that, by whichever of its effects we note it, this radiation is
not simple, but complex. Thus we must remember that heat,
like light, is of different kinds. To use Melloni's illustration,
radiant light would, to any eye that could see it, appear to be
of totally different colours ; and hence, it may be added, we
ought no more to attribute to it a single rate of absorption
with regard to any absorbing medium than to assume that a
blue and a red ray would pass through a red glass with equal
facility. The statement of this fact may perhaps seem
superfluous to the reader, for it has long been in one sense
well known. But in another and most important sense it is
not well known ; and it cannot be superfluous to recall its
bearing on our present research, since it is the neglect to
follow it into its consequences which has led to the error in
question. Since, then, the solar energy, whether regarded
in whole as " heat " or " chemical action," or in part as
" light," is the sum of an infinite number of radiations ; these
may be conceivably influenced in an infinite diversity of ways
by the different atmospheric constituents. In fact the larger
particles rather reflect than diffuse the heat or light, and hence
treat all wave-lengths nearly alike, or diminish the direct
radiation by a nearly general absorption ; minuter ones begin
to act selectively, or, on the whole, more at one end of the
spectrum than the other ; smaller particles, whether of dust
or faintest mist, and smaller still, form a probably con
tinuous sequence of more and more selective action, down

                   of t/ie Atmospheric Absorption.                   293
almost to the actual molecule, whose vibration is felt in the
purely selective absorption of some single ray. The effect of
the action of the grosser dust-particles, then, is to produce
a general and comparatively indifferent " absorption of all
rays, after which the spectrum would everywhere seem equally
less bright and less hot. The effect of the molecular absorp
tion is to fill the spectrum with evidences of the selective
action in the form of dark telluric lines, taking out some
kinds of light and heat, and not others, so that after absorp
 tion what remains is not only less in amount, but altered in
 kind. Between these two extreme examples of absorption, we
 repeat, an unlimited number of others must exist ; but we
 shall need here for simplicity to first treat the whole as coming
 under one or the other of these two types, a procedure already
 more accurate than the primitive one followed by Bouguer,
 Herschel, and Pouillet, but which we recognize as still but a
 convention, which is imposed on us provisionally by the
 actual complexity of nature.
      It will be seen now more clearly that the whole primitive
  process followed by Pouillet is an assumption, for it is simply
  taken for granted that the same proportion will be absorbed
  by one like stratum as by another. On actually trying the
  experiment, however, with media in the laboratory, Melloni
  long since observed that like proportions wore not absorbed
  by like strata ; and the reason was found in the fact just
  noted, that radiant energy is not a single emanation, but the
  sum of an infinity of diverse ones, each with its own separate
  rate of absorption. It follows that the coefficient of trans
  mission is truly constant only in the case of the absolutely
  homogeneous ray, which the ordinary photometer or thermo
  meter cannot in the least discriminate, and which the finest
  linear thermopile or bolometer can but approximately discern ;
  and hence that the original light of the star or heat of the
   sun, and the amount absorbed, can at best only be found
  approximately. However familiar this principle may be in
   some departments of physics, astronomers and meteorologists
   have been slow in making this application to the present case,
   but have continued to deduce the brightness of the stars, or
   the Solar Constant, from observations in which the radiation
   is either treated as absolutely homogeneous, or in which its
   non-homogeneity is scarcely recognized as a factor of im
   portance *.
      * Exceptions to thta remark are, however, to be made in favour of the
   very early work of Principal Forbes (Royal Society's ' Philosophical
   Transactions,' May 1842), and of the more recent labour of M. Crova
    (Acadtmie det Sciences de MontpeUier, 1876). See also the excellent

 294          .     Mr. S. P. Langley on the Amount
    This neglect to make what seems so pertinent an applica
 tion of Melloni's observation, even after it had been explained
 and extended (by Biot), will seem more explicable when it is
 remembered that no direct means of measuring the absorption
 in even approximately homogeneous rays till very recently
 existed, and that a departure from the old formula, which
ig;iores the difficulties, involves their recognition, and the
devisal of new processes to meet them. Even if we, by the
employment of such new processes, succeed in measuring the
absorption in approximately homogeneous rays, the approxi
mation is chiefly to homogeneity in wave-length, and not to
uniformity of physical properties in consecutive wave-lengths,
so that we are unable to represent the absorption as any con
tinuous function of the latter. In other words, we may
measure on separate narrow portions (A\1; AX2, &c.) of the
spectrum, and determine for each its apparent coefficient of
transmission ( pu p«, &c), which is in each case some func
tion of the wave-length ; but we are not at liberty to write
that, the original energy of the heavenly body
since our <f>\ is really discontinuous, a remark the import of
which will become more apparent in the sequel. For the
present at least we are at liberty only to divide the spectrum
into a finite number of equal parts, and to mechanically sum
them.
    I have already stated elsewhere * that in neglecting the
fact that the absorption is really selective we not only commit
an error, but an error that always lies in one way, so that any
determination of the absorption we make by the ordinary and
erroneous formula never errs by being too great, but is, so far
littlo treatise ' Actinomttrie ' by M. Radau. The use of two coefficients
is proposed in this, as it has been before, but does not seem to have been
followed by others, who, like M. Violle, have subsequently (Annales de
 Chimie et de Physique, 1870) employed but a single coefficient of trans
mission. Still more lately, however, the importance of the consideration
on which the writer here insists has been remarked on by Messrs. I^echer
and Pernter, and perhaps by others. The employment of the method of
Forbes, especially as modified and extended by Crova, appears to be the
best means at the command of the observer with the actinometer or pho
tometer. This method, however, is unfortunately very limited in its
practical application, owing to the insufficiency of data thus obtainable,
and it still gives a necessarily too small result, though a larger one than
Pouillet's.

as it depends on this formula, always, and invariably, too small.
The demonstration may be put in an extromely simple form,
but I am not aware that it has been elsewhere given, though
it was indicated in the proceedings just cited.
    Let us first suppose the radiation of the heavenly body to
be really composed before absorption of two portions, A and
B. Lot A have a special coefficient of transmission (a),
and B another, special to itself (b). Then, if we assume
(still for considerations of convenience only) that each of
these portions is, separately considered, homogeneous, we
may write down the results in the form of two geometrical
progressions, thus : —

    The fractions here are the coefficients of transmission, as
deduced from observations at different zenith-distances. They
 evidently differ, and (as will be shown) each is larger than
the preceding.
    In the above table Aa + Bb is the sum of the two kinds of
radiation as observed after absorption by one unit stratum
(sec (f=l) by the photometer or actinometer; Aa2 + Bb* is
the sum of the radiations observed after absorption by two
strata (sec f=2) &c. ; but we are here supposed to inde
pendently know the really dual constitution of the radiation,

                 (Value after n absorptions \«—m
                  Value after m absorptions/
is a constant. It is in fact not a constant, as we shall prove
later; but we shall first show that, if we proceed upon the
ordinary assumption, the value obtained for the original light
of the star before absorption will, in this case, be too small.
For, if we observe by a method which discriminates between
the two radiations, we shall have, if we separately deduce the
original lights from our observation of what remains after one,
and, again, after two absorptions, the true sum
while if we observe by the ordinary method, which makes no
discrimination, we shall have the erroneous equation
                                (Aa + Bby
which is algebraically less than the first, or correct value ; for
the expression
                   (Aa)2 (Bb)' (Aa + Bby
                    Aa* + Bb1          Aa' + BP
readily reduces to the known form
                          a2 + b2>2ab.
Moreover, since a* + b* — 2ab = (a — b)2, the error increases icith
the difference between the coefficients.
   Now, in the general case, if we suppose the original radia
tion L to be composed, before absorption, of any number of
parts An A2, A3, + . . .having respectively the coefficients of
absorption au a2, a3, +¦ . . ., the true value of L is given by a
series of fractions which may be written in the form
whereas the value of the original energy by the customary
formula would be
                             _S(Aa)\

                  of the Atmospheric Absorption.              297
so that, all the quantities being positive, by a known theorem
L>Lj ; and for the same values of Aj, A2, A3,                 this
inequality is greater the greater the difference in the values
of the coefficients aj, a2, a3,
   But this is stating in other words that the true values found
by observing separate coefficients of transmission are always
greater than those found when we do not distinguish between
the radiations of which the light (or heat) of the star or sun
is composed, and also that the amount by which the true
values are greater increases with the difference between the
coefficients.
   We have stated above that the usual hypothesis makes the
coefficient of transmission a constant. It will be seen from
the above table, however, that it varies from one stratum to
the next ; that it is least when obtained by observations near
the zenith ; and that it increases progressively as we approach
the horizon. For, since a and b are each less than unity, each
of the sums Aa + Bb &c. in the above table is less than the
preceding. It is also evident that their rate of diminution
decreases as we approach the horizon, since
        Aa'-Aa" > Aa4- Aa4,          Boa-B&3 > Bo3-B64.
Hence
      (Aaa + Bb') - (Aa' + Bb3) > (Aas + Bb3) - (Aa4 + Bb*) .
Consequently the difference between the numerators of two
successive ratios, such as
                      Aa3 + B63 Aa* + B64
                      Aa2 + BJJ< Aa3 + Bb3
is less than that of their denominators. In other words,
although both numerator and denominator decrease in suc
cessive ratios, the ratios themselves increase progressively;
and a similar demonstration applies to the form
                  Agi+Bb2       (Aan + Bb»\^i
                   Aa + Bb < V Aa + B6 )      '
But these ratios are the coefficients of transmission in
question.
   Further, a simple inspection of the form of the expression
       Aa2-Aa3>Aa3-Aat              Bb>-Bb*>Bb3-Bb*
shows that what is there demonstrated for two numbers and
two coefficients A, a, and B, br is true for any number, even
infinite, which is the case we deal with in actual observation.

 and hence universally true, that when the separate coefficients
 of transmission are positive and less than unity (as is the
 case in nature), the general coefficient of transmission in the
 customary exponential formula is—
     (1) Never a constant, and (as determined from the custo
 mary formula),
     (2) always too large ;
     (3) always larger and larger as we approach the horizon.
     (4) The original light or heat of the heavenly body as
 found by the photometric and actinomctric processes, and the
 formulae in universal use, is always too small, a conclusion
 which we have just reached by another method.
     The above demonstration does not tell us in how great a
  degree this coefficient is too large, and for aught we have here
  yet demonstrated the error may be practically negligible.
      Since the method ordinarily employed demonstrably gives
  too small results, the burden of proof might seem to rest on
  those who still employ it, who might now with propriety be
  asked to show that the continued use of methods and formulae
  certainly in some degree inaccurate does not lead to an error
  at least as great as the total absorption in question. This has
  never been done. There is a common assumption that if
  there were any considerable error, its results would become
  apparent in such numerous observations as have been made
  all over the world in stellar photometry and solar actinometry
   during this century, since in these observations of stellar
   magnitudes, for instance, two stars whose relative magnitudes
   are positively known give results agreeing with the ordinary
   formula when one is near the zenith and the other near the
   horizon. At first this looks almost like evidence that there
   can be no great error in the determination of absolute magni
   tudes by the ordinary formula, and yet this apparent proof is
   demonstrably a fallacy. It is certainly a specious one, but it
   is absolutely demonstrable that the error might be enormous
   —that the actual absorption might be, for instance, 50 per
   cent, instead of 20—without this gross discrepancy being
   detected by our present modes of observation. As the pre
   sent methods are known to give, as I have just said, values

                 of the Atmospheric Absorption.              21)9
in substantial agreement (within three or four per cent.) from
independent observations made at very different altitudes of
the sun or star, the proof of this last statement may well be
demanded, and I proceed to give it.
   (It is admitted that the original energy is divisible into an
unlimited number of rays, each characterized by its own
coefficient of transmission, and that these coefficients have
values varying from zero to unity.) Let this original energy
of the heavenly body be X, and let us denote, as in Table L,
the observed energy after one absorption by H, after two by
N, after three by O, &c.
   The assumption of those who admit the existence of an
error but maintain that it is negligible, is that, since we do
know that 0 : N=N : M very nearly, there/ore N : M = M : X
very nearly; or, in other words, that if we can prove that
     W
M=£j- within three or four per cent., we are entitled to

zero (so that K, L, and all other rays affected with such
coefficients sensibly vanish before they reach the observer) to
see that the only quantities sensible to observation are those
with relatively large coefficients as A, B, C, D, &c; so that
now
                 Aa +B6 + Cc + Dd +&c. = M,
                 Aa* + Bb1 + Cc2 + Dd» + Ac. = N,
                 Aa" + Bb3 + Cc3 + Da* + Ac. = O.
From these values M, N, 0, &c. we can never estimate the
amount of the extinguished rays K, L, &c., since these do not
enter into the observed values by any amount sensible at all.
   Now to the rays A, B, C, D, &c., which remain, and to
their coefficients, we may evidently assign any values con-

we can always assign positive and real values to A, a, &c.,
such that R may be as small as we desire.
    But R represents here the apparent error of observation, as
inferred from a comparison between " high and low stars."
Hence it follows thut however close the agreement may be
between observations on absorption, made at quite different alti
tudes of the heavenly body, ive have no rigid to infer that the
error of the final result is not indefinitely great.
    If, while the truth of the above proposition is admitted in
the abstract, it be still urged that we do not as a matter of
fact have reason to suppose that so indefinitely large a part of
the solar rays are quite extinguished ere they reach us, I
would point out that it is not in reality necessary to suppose
the present extreme case (i. e. that of a large part of the
original radiation being wholly absorbed), which has been
taken here only to make the nature of the argumeut more
evident.
    For if we agree (as we certainly may) that a notable por
tion of the coefficients are near zero, and another notable por
tion still but small fractions of unity, what we have just shown
 for an extreme case will also follow for the usual one, for it
follows from the previous demonstration that the greater the
 discrepancy between the coefficients the more shall we under
 rate the true absorption, and the greater will be our error.
 To see what the conditions actually are, in inferring it from
 the ordinary formula, we must now consider more narrowly
 how this telluric absorption takes place. I have already
 spoken of the general or non-selective absorption, whose ex
 treme type is the scattering of light by largo dust-particles in
 a sunbeam, and now proceed to consider the other typical
 extreme, which is that of purely selective absorption.
    1 have here some photographs*, which I owe to the kind
 ness of Professor Rowland of Baltimore, in which we have a
 portion of the spectrum near D, photographed when the sun
 was on the meridian, and a second photograph of the same
 limited portion, at about half-past three in the afternoon,
 when the air-mass traversed was only about one half greater.
 Notice nevertheless the immense difference caused by the

                  of the Atmospheric Absorption.                   301
growth of telluric lines in this short interval. There is
scarcely a hair's breadth of the plate which they have not
invaded. It is true the whole spectrum is not so densely
crowded with them as this region is, and yet, broadly speaking,
we may say that almost the entire spectrum is visibly filled
with telluric lines, in all but juxtaposition, just before sunset.
   What is a telluric line ? A very narrow black and cold
region where the absorption has already done its full work, or
which is, at any rate, so black and so cold that it can grow
very little blacker or colder. The extinction of the ray here
is nearly absolute, or, in other words, its coefficient of trans
mission is very small indeed. If we consider the same part
of the spectrum at noon, we find that the region occupied by
these lines must in reality be darker than if there were no
absorbing air, even if the absorption has not progressed so far
that the individual absorption-lines are visible, or distinctly
black. But, in fact, we do see parts of them distinctly black,
even at noon. Moreover, if we climb a mountain into the
upper air, we find great numbers of these rays practically
extinguished even there, long before they have reached the
observer at sea-level. In this way I have myself observed
numerous telluric lines quite black on Etna*, and even at
greater altitudes, in the pure dry air of the Sierra Nevadas of
California; so that there is every reason to believe that at the
highest altitudes attainable by man certain portions have
already disappeared from the spectrum, and that we cannot
correctly infer the original condition by any amount of ob
servation on the different rates of absorption of what remains.
Irradiation makes the telluric line appear narrower and weaker
than it really is. Photography, in this respect, is a much
more trustworthy guide ; and I think that those of us who are
used to seeing the spectrum of a low sun, and who have
gathered any impression of thinness and rarity of these lines,
may correct our ideas with advantage by the study of these
admirable photographs, of which 1 will only observe that
when they were taken the air- mass at noon was 1*09 and in
the afternoon l'OO; so that all this increase of telluric lines
came with a very little increment of the absorbing air, and is
but a small part of what we should see nearer sunset. Evi
dently the noon spectrum must be less bright, not only for
the telluric lines distinctly seen but for thoso indistinctly seen
individually, or latent only, and which come out as separate
individual lines when the sun is lower. It results from what
 has just been said, then, that the part of the absorption due to
telluric lines alone is more considerable than is commonly
  * See also the important observations by Professor Smyth on Teneriffe.

302            Mr. S. P. Langley on the Amount
thought, and that the coefficients of absorption and trans
mission, which have bepn obtained by various writers on acti-
nometry and photometry, are really in general the mean coeffi
cients obtained from the average of hundreds of these alterna
tions (and necessarily too small) ; and yet, more than this, that
tho smallest part included in the field of the experiment,
whether the telluric lines are separately visible or whether
they are only latent there, is filled with alternations of trans
mission and absorption, and therefore, according to our pre
vious demonstration, the mean result, even when obtained by
a linear thermopile or bolometer, must still indicate too feeble
an absorption. I speak now only of the strictly selective
absorption ; but I again remind the reader that there is also
the partly selective and comparatively non-selective absorption
already mentioned, and that practically between the telluric
line and the general absorption we have every intermediate
coefficient of transmission from unity to zero. The previous
criticism applies then, though in a less degree, to the few
investigations where two or three coefficients have been used,
and even to investigations with the linear thermopile or
bolometer, using numerous coefficients, among which I mean
to include my own. I have done all 1 could to minimise tho
error by measuring on rays as nearly homogeneous as possible
—that is, by measuring on parts of tho spectrum so narrow
that they may be called, without exaggeration, linear, a name
which we may certainly apply to a hair-like line i of a
millim. in width, forming the working face of the linear
bolometer ; but even this strip, when laid down in the spec
trum, covers more than the distance between the D lines ;
and if we fix our attention on that well-known region as a
type, wo see that this hair-like line itself covers in this narrow
 interval alone at least a dozen alternations between brightness
 and almost total extinction, so that though in respect to
 wave-lengths we may be said to measure approximately
homogeneous rays with a linear instrument, in respect to this
 local absorption we do not. I am convinced that no one
knows what this absorption really is in amount ; but I think
we can now begin to see somewhat of what it is in kind, and
we may be prepared to agree that the data in the annexed
table (Table II.) may represent numerically the proportions
of nature with a certain approximation. In this table (II.)
 we have certain numerical results consequent on the approxi
 mative hypothesis that the total heat in sun or star is divided
 into a certain finite number of parts, each one of which has
its own rate of absorption.
    Here the radiant energy before absorption is supposed to

                  of the Atmospheric Absorption.             303
 be divided into ten parts, A,' B, C, . . . . J, each having its
 separate coefficient of transmission a, b, &c.—an arrangement
 which may be taken to represent some sort of adumbration of
 the complexity of nature s problem and the method of her
work. It is given here only in illustration of the kind and
 degree of the errors induced by use of the usual formulas ;
and the demonstration already given in no way depends on
these numerical values, whose approximate exactness I do
 not need to maintain, since they are offered merely as a
numerical illustration and in justification of the previous
assertion, that the absorption at any rate may be more than
double what we think it (as in this specific case) without our
having means of knowing of our error through our present
formula.
    It may, however, be incidentally observed that these values
do typify the facts, with a certain approximation to the real
values of nature, for they are obtained by approximate solution
of equations of the form
              ka + Bb +Cc +Dd + Ee &c. = M,
              Aa2 + Bb2 + Oc2 + DiP + Ee2 &c. = N,
              Aa' + Bb3 + Cc3 + Dd* + Ee3 &c. = 0,
where M, N, 0, &c. do not differ widely from the results of
 observation. The conclusion in this specific case therefore
 seems fairly typical of that in the general one.
    W e have here supposed that the radiant energy from the
 sun or star before it enters our atmosphere is divided into ten
 equal parts, each of which in general suffers some different
 partial absorption. While no ray may be absolutely absorbed
 or wholly transmitted, a certain small part (represented in tho
spectrum by known telluric lines) is so nearly absorbed, that
its coefficient in the first decimal place would be 0, and a
certain more considerable portion, corresponding in a general
sense to certain infra-red rays, has coefficients here undistin-
guishable from unity. Probably the greater part of the
spectral energy, however, is intermediate between these two
extreme types, and so our numerical values indicate.
   The first column is the original intensity before absorption
(we have in this particular example, for simplicity, supposed
A=B = C . . . . = J = 1, though this condition is not neces
sary. It will be observed, however, that under it in the
second column Aa=a, Bb = b, &c, so that the ¦ coefficients of
transmission, the ratios of each geometric progression, are
the same in this particular column as the intensity after
absorption).

    We give the most favourable case for the observer, where
(what is rarely or never actually possible) he begins his
observations with the sun or star in the zenith, in a sky so
changelessly serene that he may continue them up to a point
where secant J=4 (corresponding to column V.), and where
the altitude is less than 15 . And we here suppose ourselves
to have a prior knowledge both of the actual amount of the
light or heat before absorption and of its composition, while
he is assumed to attempt to deduce the prior amount by the
usual formula, and from the usual observations made in the
gross by the photometer or actinometer.
    The successive values of the absorption thus found by
comparing a zenith observation with three successively lower
altitudes are £1 per cent., 19 per cent., 18 per cent. All
agree much within the probable error of actual observation,
as observers conversant with this matter will readily admit,
and yet the actual value is all the while
                             -, or 41 per cent.
                         10.0'
     It will have been noticed, in fact, that the determinations
 of this absorption-coefficient by various observers already
 cited differ among themselves as much as these values do
 from each other; and if these conditions represent those of
  nature, the result must be, in practice, that years of observa
  tion will be accordant in giving the wholly wrong absorption
  of from 19 to 22^ per cent., and that the actual minute syste
  matic discrepancies pointed out by our theory, and which are
  significant of some error in the formula, would probably
  remain long undetected. While the observer, then, we
  admit, has strong apparent evidence from the close agreement
  of his observations that, if there be an error in his formula,
   it is practically negligible, vet this evidence, according to
  our demonstration, is fallacious, and the actual error, as ap
  pears from the numerical illustration, may well exceed double
   the amovnt in question, for the above values might evidently
   be increased without imposing any conditions but such as it
   may be reasonably assumed are those of nature.
      The writer believes the actual mean absorption of sun- and
   star-light to be at its minimum not improbably over 40 per
   cent, at the sea-level ; but were the stars alone in question,
   the fact would have but little importance, since their relative
  magnitudes (unless considerable colour is present) remain

306                Mr. S. P. Langley on the Amount
nearly the same with the false hypothesis as with the true
one, and it is with their relative magnitudes that the student
 of stellar photometry is chiefly concerned, for he desires to
 know their relative brightness at the zenith rather than their
 absolute brightness outside the atmosphere.
    With the sun, however, it is otherwise, for hero it is the
 absolute heat or light which is in question.
    Accordingly, when we apply our above conclusions to
 problems either of solar physics or of meteorology, the result
 is of an altogether different importance. Almost all the phe
 nomena of meteorology would become predictable if we knew
 how much heat reaches the soil, and how much, and in what
 altered kind, is returned to outer space. To solve these
 problems we must know how much is absorbed by our atmo
 sphere; and there are further reasons, independent of those
 cited, for believing that this is more than double what is
commonly supposed.
    It may be observed that the comparison of observations at
the base and summit of a very high mountain will enable us
to obtain much better determinat ions than the method of high-
and low-sun observations, not only on account of the diminu
tion of the absorbing air-mass, but because we thus avoid
 certain systematic differences between the atmospheric con
 ditions at noon and evening (or morning) which introduce
 constant errors into the restilts, in addition to those already
considered. From such observations I have been led, inde
pendently of theory, to conclude that the absorption is greater
than is commonly supposed. But beside this method, which
is in reach of but few, there is another at the command of all,
the significance of whoso results seems to have been hitherto
overlooked.
    If we are willing to agree that solar heat is not absorbed
by our air in the sense of being accumulated there (since
this would heat the atmosphere to the condition of a glowing
gas), wo must, it seems to me, admit that it is mainly diffused
toward and away from us by particles, so that nearly all we
lose by selective absorption from the direct light and heat of
the sun we ought to find reflected or selectively diffused to
us from the sky, or turned away from us to outer space *. I
have been engaged in measuring the heat and light from the
sky around the sun, and that from the whole sky apart from
the sun. These measures are still incomplete, and 1 will only
   * See the investigation of Tyndall on the cause of the hlue colour of
the sky (Proc. Hoy. Soc. vol. xvii. p. 223). See also the theoretical in

and of Lord Rayluigh (Phil. Mag. Feh. 1871 et ieq.).

say that they seem to show that the average amount of blue
light (to speak for the moment of blue light only) which is
thus scattered from an ordinary pure and cloudless sky at the
sea-level already represents a selective absorption of much
over 40 per cent, of the original blue in the direct sunlight;
but that also the mean diffusion is, though less than this, still
over 40 per cent., and hence that to obtain the actual light of
sun or star before absorption we must add, at any rate, over
40 per cent, to the observed value. To make the meaning of
this last statement clear, it may be observed that if there were
bright clouds in the sky we should have (as wo know by expe
rience) more light from the clouds than from an equal portion
of the blue, but that in this case our observing station would
gain the added light at the expense of those portions of the
 earth which were in the clouds' shadow ; and in this case,
 therefore, wo should not be justified in adding the light we
 receive to the observed sunlight to obtain that before absorp
 tion. But with a uniform sky it follows that every point on
 the horizon enjoys the same sunshine that wo do at our own
 station; and hence it is evident that if the atmosphere were
taken entirely away the sun would grow brighter by all the
 light which the atmosphere now sends us, and, in fact, by
 much more, since this atmosphere is scattering light not only
 towards us, but also to outer space.
    Roughly speaking, we may say that we receive on the
 average at the sea-level as much light from the sky as we do
 from the sun itself—getting more light from the sun at mid
 day than from the sky, but more in the morning and afternoon
 from the sky than from the sun, There is no reason to
 believe that any smaller proportion of starlight is diffused
 earthward, and this is independent of that which is diffused
 toward outer space.
    All my own investigations, whether through observations
 at the sea-level or at an altitude of nearly 15,000 feet, lead
 mo to believe that at any rate the mean absorption of light
 (and of heat also) by our atmosphere is probably at least
 double that which is customarily estimated ; and also to con
 clude that fine dust-particles, both near the surface and at a
 great altitude, play a more important part in this absorption,
 both general and selective, than has been heretofore supposed.
 I hope soon to make public the result of an investigation into
 the composite character of the radiation as an indication of
 what the sky has selectively borrowed from the direct solar
 rays.

XXXV. On the Electromagnetic Rotation of the Plane of Pola
   rization of Light by means ofIron, Cobalt, and Nickel. By
   A. KUNDT*.
DR. KERR has shownt that the plane of polarization of
         the light reflected normally from the polished pole of
an electromagnet suffers a. rotation. The direction of the
rotation is opposed to that of the magnetizing current, and
consequently to that of the ainperian molecular currents of
the magnet. Kerr has further examined the reflection of
light at the polished side-face of a magnet. Ho found that
here also a rotation of the plane of polarization takes place
when the electromagnet is excited or has its magnetism
reversed. The phenomena are, however, somewhat complicated.
   Plane-polarized light which is reflected at any angle from
a metallic surface retains its plane of polarization only in the
cases in which that of the incident light is coincident with
the plane of incidence, or at right angles to it. In all other
positions of the plane of polarization the reflected light is
elliptically polarized ; Kerr therefore confined his investiga
tions to the first two cases. He finds that if the polarizing
and analyzing nicols are at right angles, then when the
magnet is excited the field of view becomes bright, which ho
interprets as a rotation of the plane of polarization produced
by the magnetization. The direction and the amount of
this rotation are not dependent simply upon the angle of
incidence, but are different also according as the plane of
polarization of the incident light (the long diagonal of the
section of the nicol) is coincident with, or at right angles to,
the plane of incidence.
   If the light is polarized in the plane of incidence, the direc
tion of rotation is the same for ail angles of incidence, and
opposed to that of the amperian molecular currents of the
reflecting magnet.
   If the plane of polarization is at right angles to the plane
of incidence, then for angles of incidence from 0° to about 80°
the direction of rotation is the same as that of the amperian
currents, but opposed to it for incidences between 80° and 90°.
The amount of rotation is in both cases u maximum for an
angle of incidence of about 65°.
   There is also a rotation with oblique incidence of the light
upon the polished pole-surface of an electromagnet. The
direction of the rotation according to Kerr, so far as I can
gather from his data, is the same for all angles of incidence

   Electromagnetic Rotation of the Plane of Polarization.              309
and opposed to the molecular currents, whether the plane of
polarization of the incident light is coincident with, or at
right angles to, the plane of incidence.
    In all the experiments of Dr. Kerr the magnitude of the
rotation is very small—in favourable cases it amounts only to
a few minutes ; and Kerr has consequently made no measure
ments, but has only estimated the amount of rotation in the
different positions and determined its direction. Some two
years ago I repeated Kerr's experiments. My experiments
completely confirmed all Dr. Kerr's statements ; with the
one exception that, upon reflection at the surface of a pole,
I obtained also a reversal in the direction of rotation at an
incidence of about 80°, when the plane of polarization of the
incident light and the plane of incidence were at right angles
to each other. This reversal seems to have escaped Dr.
 Kerr. I have thus succeeded in bringing all the phenomena
 of reflection at the side faces as well as at the poles of the
 magnets under one point of view, from which possibly an
 explanation of the same may result.
     That a rotation of the plane of polarization takes place at
 perpendicular incidence upon the pole-surface of an electro
 magnet has been further confirmed by Gordon*. He obtained
 a rotation of 26' 45" upon reversal of the magnetizing current.
     Then Hallt has shown that with cobalt and nickel also,
 when they form the pole of a magnet, a rotation of the plane
 of polarization in the direction opposite to that of the magne
 tizing current takes place. It may be further mentioned that
  Hall has also examined whether the plane of polarization of
 the light which traverses a very thin transparent film of
  nickel is rotated. The transparent film was prepared accor
  ding to the method given by Wright, by deflagration of a
  nickel electrode in a Geissler tube. Hall examined two nickel
  mirrors, but was not able to perceive any rotation, and remarks
  that " both these experiments on direct transmission have
  been, we may say, quite negative."
      Lastly, we must mention also that Fitzgerald has endea
  voured to give a theoretical explanation of the rotation produced
  by magnets. I shall further on briefly state Fitzgerald's
  theory, and show that it is not in agreement with the obser
  vations.
      I have now recently measured the electromagnetic rotation
  of the plane of polarization upon reflection from iron, cobalt,
  and nickel, and completely confirmed my previous experiments

310      Prof. A. Kundt on the Electromagnetic Rotation
and also those of Kerr. I shall further on briefly review
the quantitative results obtained.
   I have, however, succeeded in rendering Kerr's experiments
decidedly more complete by another method ; since, having
prepared thin transparent films of iron, cobalt, and nickel, I
have examined the rotation of the plane of polarization pro
duced upon passage of light through these films. The result
is as follows:—
    Transparent films of iron, cobalt, and nickel in the magnetic '
field rotate the plane of polarization of transmitted light very
powerfully. The rotation produced by iron for the mean rays
of the spectrum is more than 30,00U times as great as that pro
duced by glass of equal thickness. The rotation takes place
with all three substances in the direction of the magnetizing
current.
   After a few brief remarks upon the mirrors and transparent
films employed, I give in what follows, first of all, observa
tions upon the electromagnetic rotation upon transmission
through metals ; then my experiments upon the rotation which
is produced by reflection of light from metals ; then are in
cluded, and added at suitable points, general discussions of the
experiments and the conclusions drawn from them.
   I. The Mirrors and Transparent Metallic Films employed.
   In the experiments upon reflection, I at first employed
circular steel mirrors of 35 million, diameter and 6 millim.
thickness, of a very high polish. The mirrors were either
placed between the poles and suitably fastened there, or
attached laterally to the clamps uniting the poles. Any pos
sible distortions were examined by observing in a telescope
the images of horizontal and vertical millimetre-scales reflected
in the mirrors. Any distortions or changes in the position of
the mirrors would be recognized by small irregularities and
displacements in the images given by the mirrors. In the
series of experiments with mirrors, such as described later on,
no irregularities were detected by means of the scale and tele
scope by which the optical effects observed could have been
explained. Then I have employed mirrors consisting of
speculum-metal, which had been electroplated with iron or
nickel. And, finally, I employed plate-glass mirrors, coated
electrolj'tically with very thin transparent films of iron.
   If a glass surface is to be electroplated with a metal, the
glass surface must first of all be made conducting. I tried to
silver glass in the usual way and then to deposit the iron upon
this layer of silver ; but so far these attempts have not led to
any result. So soon as the current was closed, and iron or

              of the Plane of Polarization of Light.         311
other metal began to deposit itself from the solution upon the
silver, the film came off the glass in shreds. With a very good
film of silver and exactly adjusted strength of current it might
be possible to coat the silver with another metal electrolyti-
cally ; at least I have at times succeeded in coating small
pieces of silvered glass with copper ; but I have not pursued
the attempt further, since a more convenient method presented
itself. M. Konig, in Paris, for the rotating mirrors employed
in his acoustical apparatus uses plate-glass, into one surface
of which a very thin transparent reflecting film of platinum
has been burnt. The film of platinum is so thin that it is
very transparent. Whether it is absolutely continuous is
 not of any consequence ; at least it conducts so well that it
 may be made an electrode, and covered with a reflecting layer
 of another metal of an}- desired thinness.
    I have deposited iron according to Varrentrapp's method * ;
 cobalt and nickel from solution of the ammonio-sulphates of
 cobalt or nickel. The concentration of the solution and
 strength of current must be adjusted according to the thick
 ness which the film is desired to have. 1 have further coated
 some of the iron and nickel films with reflecting surfaces of
 gold, silver, or copper. These metallic films may easily be
 obtained so thin that they, together with the platinum, are
 quite transparent.
    The incident white light becomes brown when it traverses
 the iron film, grey with nickel, and bluish grey with cobalt.
 The surfaces of the deposited films usually reflect very well;
 but the physical peculiarities of the different surfaces seem to
 be somewhat variable. Possibly the metals are in certain
 cases deposited in a crystalline condition. If we cut a long
 strip from an iron film, it may easily be converted into a per
 manent magnet by rubbing with another magnet. It is
 known that the coercive force of galvanically deposited iron is
 very large.
     We are thus able to prepare permanent transparent iron
  magnets, as also transparent magnets of cobalt or nickel.
     When suspended by a silk fibre, these transparent magnets
  adjust themselves perfectly well in the magnetic meridian
  under the influence of the earth's magnetism.
     I hope to study the behaviour of these very thin transparent
  magnets later on.
     II. Potation of the Plane of Polarization of Light by its
             Passage through Iron, Cobalt, and Nickel.
     A Ruhmkorff's electromagnet of the usual construct ion was
                   • Muspratt's Chemie, vol. ii. p. 1200.

312      Profi A. Kundt on tlie Electromagnetic Rotation
employed for these experiments. The iron core, wrapped with
wire, was provided with conical, rounded, and perforated pole-
pieces. The poles were placed about 4 milliui. apart. The
current, which was furnished by a Gramme machine, had an
intensity of about 1G amperes. The glass plate under exami
nation with its metallic covering was placed midway between
the poles in a suitable holder, permitting both horizontal and
vertical displacement and rotation, as nearly as possible at
right angles to the direction of the rays of light which tra
versed it. Sunlight was always employed.
   In order to measure the rotation produced by the film of
iron, cobalt, or nickel, a portion of the piece of glass not
covered with the electrolytic deposit of metal was compared
with a portion covered by the film, by determining first the
rotation produced by glass and platinum, and then determi
ning the rotation due to glass, platinum and iron, cobalt, or
nickel. Usually the thin platinum layer produced no measu
rable rotation; so that a portion of the glass covered by the
metallic deposit could be compared with a portion from which
the metal and platinum had been removed by means of acid.
Since the rotation produced by platinum and glass alone, or
by the platinum and glaf-s together with the coating of iron,
cobalt, or nickel gave rise to a tolerably strong dispersion,
the adjustment was made in these experiments for the transi
tion-tint between blue and red; so that the rotation was
determined for the mean rays of the spectrum. When not
otherwise specified, the rotation given in the following account
means the sum of the rotations in both directions produced by
reversal of the current. A rotation in the direction of the
amperian currents is further specified as positive, and that in
the opposite direction as negative.

    The question may now arise whether the rotations obtained
 for iron, cobalt, and nickel are actually produced by these
 substances, or whether the observations admit of being ex
 plained in any other way. Since in these experiments por
 tions of glass coated with magnetic metal and coated only
 with platinum are successively brought between the conical
 magnetic poles, it might be thought that the intensity of the
 magnetic field between the poles might be different in the
 two cases, and that the difference in rotation might be thus
 brought about. I have convinced myself by numerous and
 varied experiments that even when large masses of iron are
 brought into the field, neither the rotation of the iron mirror
 nor that of a piece of glass is perceptibly altered.
    It might further be supposed that the thin, strongly mag
 netic film of iron which clings close to the glass might have
 some special unknown influence upon the power of rotation
 possessed b}' the glass, and the difference observed in rotation
 between the glass covered with iron and without this cover
 ing should be attributed to this effect. In order to decide
 this point, I placed between the poles a narrow vessel with
 plane glass sides filled with carbon sulphide, and placed in
 this a portion of the platinized glass not coated with iron, and
 determined the rotation produced by the whole system ; then
 a portion of the platinized glass coated with iron was put in
 the fluid, and the rotation again determined.

         „ second            „          „           +12 27

    If the platinized glass was placed between the poles without
 using the sulphide of carbon—
       The rotation obtained was                     +111
       And for the glass with iron                   +2 13
                         Difference                  +12
 Exactly the same as before.
    We see that the rotation of the sulphide of carbon which is
 in as close contact with the iron as the glass is, is not at all
 influenced by it. We cannot therefore avoid the conclusion
 that the difference 1° 2' in both cases is the rotation produced
 by the iron.
 III. Dispersion produced by Rotation, Specific Rotatory Power,
  and Circular Double Refraction of Iron, Cobalt, and Nickel.
    Since lately there has frequently not been sufficient sun for
the purpose, I have not been able to make extended experi
 ments on the rotation of the plane of polarization for the dif
 ferent colours produced by iron, cobalt, and nickel. Never
 theless I have been able to recognize with certainty that iron
 has an anomalous rotatory dispersion. Light which had
 passed through a tolerably dark red glass was rotated per
 ceptibly more powerfully than blue light obtained by passing
 the sun's rays through ammoniacal copper-sulphate solution.
    Corresponding experiments with cobalt and nickel gave
only a feeble rotatory dispersion. Experiments in which the
 red and blue rays of a somewhat impure spectrum were
employed showed also an anomalous rotatory dispersion in
the iron.
    The specific rotatory power of iron was determined with as
good a mirror as possible.
   The thickness of the iron film obtained by weighing the
mirror before and after coating it with iron with the battery
was found to be 0*000055 millim.; the rotation for the mean
rays of the spectrum produced by glass and platinum was
1° 37', and that produced by glass, platinum and iron 3° 25':
consequently that produced by iron 1° 48'; the thickness of
the platinized glass was 1-61 millim. Consequently the iron
rotates some 32,000 times more than the glass used.
                               Y2

316      Prof. A. Kundt on tlie Electromagnetic Rotation
   With another mirror, whose thickness was 0*000069 millim.,
the rotation of the iron was found to be 35,000 times as great
as that of the glass.
   Cobalt has a specific rotation nearly the same as that of
iron. Nickel, on the other hand, is decidedly weaker. Two
nickel mirrors gave a mean rotation of 14,000 times that of
the glass.
   I, of course, regard these numbers as approximate only,
since the determination of thickness by weighing is very
inexact. They give occasion, however, for some interesting
conclusions.
   According to the experiments of Righi *, a circularly-
polarized ray in which the motion of the ajther-molecules
takes place in the same direction as that of the molecular
currents, traversing a substance which, in a magnetic field,
produces rotation in the same direction as the amperian cur
rents, advances more rapidly than a circularly-polarized ray-
in which the sether-molecules move in the opposite direction.
There is therefore a circular double refraction. If n and n'
are the indices of refraction for the two opposite circular rays,
and 0 the amount of the observed rotation, d the thickness of
the substance traversed by the ray, and X the wave-length;
then
   If we take X=0,00058, for d the thickness of iron film
given above, viz. 0*000055, <-6 = l° 48', we have
                          (n-n')=0-l.
   This difference in refractive index amounts to more than
half of that between the ordinary and extraordinary rays in
Iceland spar, and is about ten times as great as the difference
of refractive indices in quartz at right angles to the axis.
   The difference of the refractive indices for the two cir
cularly-polarized rays in the direction of the axis in quartz,
according to Lang, amounts only to 0"0000718.
   The film of iron used has therefore, in the magnetic field
which I have employed, a rotation 1462 times as great as the
natural rotation in quartz of the same thickness as the iron
film. It will be necessary to return later on to the circular
double refraction of our iron films when we come to speak of
Fitzgerald's theory.

    IV. Rotation of the Plane of Polarisation upon Normal
            Reflection from Iron, Cobalt, and Nickel.
   For these experiments also RuhmkorfFs electromagnet was
employed. The perforated pole furthest from the observer
was replaced by a solid pole without perforation. By re
flection at a glass plate inclined at an angle of 45° to the axis
of the pole, light was sent through the perforated limb of the
electromagnet, reflected at the metal plate placed between the
poles, and then passed through the glass plate, and so through
the analyzing nicol. The reflecting surfaces could be ad
justed exactly at right angles to the direction of the incident
rays of light, and as nearly as possible at right angles to the
axis of the electromagnet, by observations for the purpose.
   The plane of polarization of the polarizing nicol was made
to coincide as exactly as possible with the plane of incidence,
in order to have as much light as possible. If upon reflection
from the metallic surface any rotation took place, so that the
plane of polarization of the reflected light no longer coincided
with the plane of incidence upon the glass plate inclined at
45°, then upon passing through this a further rotation took
place corresponding to Fresnel's formula for the refraction of
polarized light. The analyzing nicol is therefore used to
 measure, not simply the electromagnetic rotation at the metallic
 surface, but the sum of this and the rotation produced by the
 glass plate. The latter, of course, was placed so far from the
 magnet that no electromagnetic rotation could be produced
in it.
    If a denote the angle which the plane of polarization of a
 ray of light falling upon a glass plate makes with the plane
 of incidence, then the angle y between the two planes, after
 passage through the plate, is given by the formula
                          ,         tan a
where i and r denote the angles of incidence and refraction
respectively.
    Since in the observations i was always nearly 45° and the
refractive index of the glass about 1*48, calculation shows
that the values of the directly observed rotations must be
 decreased by about 10 per cent, in order to obtain the actual
 electromagnetic effect. Dr. Kerr as well as Mr. Gordon
 seem to have overlooked the effect of the glass plate ; at least
they do not mention it.
    I have retained the same arrangement of the glass plate as
these observers, that it might be possible to have the light

318     Prof. A. Kundt on the Electromagnetic Rotation
actually falling upon the metallic surface exactly at right
angles.
   Mirrors of iron, cobalt, and nickel were used for these ex
periments, prepared by electrolytic deposition of the metal
upon platinized glass. It lias already been remarked that in
consequence of the small thickness of these plates, the forces
exerted upon them by the magnets are so small that no dis
tortion of the glass plates which support the metal films can
occur.

   The rotation is opposite to the direction of the magnetizing
current ; consequently the above numbers, like the following
ones for cobalt and nickel, are marked with the negative sign.
It must be mentioned that a dispersion due to rotation was
distinctly observed in reflection also, which, like that pro
duced by the transmission of light, is an anomalous disper
sion—t. e. the red rays are rotated more powerfully than the
blue ones. It is remarkable that mirror No. 3, which was
very transparent, shows so large a rotation. I have noticed
several times that other mirrors, also of smaller thickness,
have shown a comparatively large rotation. I have not yet
been able to make more accurate experiments on the connexion
of the rotation with the thickness of the reflecting layer.

   Thus nickel, upon reflection, rotates only about half as
powerfully as iron and cobalt. Moreover, as was shown
above, the rotation of transmitted light produced by nickel is
 perceptibly smaller than that due to iron and cobalt.

      The molecular condition of the surface must undoubtedly
  play an important part in reflection; and since this may vary
  very greatly with the concentration of the solution and the
  strength of the current, it is hardly to be expected that iden
  tical values should bo obtained for the rotation of different
  mirrors. In order to obtain the electromagnetic rotation alone,
  all the values given above must be diminished by about 10
 per cent.
     In conclusion, it may further be mentioned that I have also
  coated platinized glass with iron and then electroplated the
  iron with silver or copper. These iron mirrors covered with
 silver or copper showed no perceptible rotation upon reflection.
  If we adjust matters so that the rays fall accurately vertically
 upon the metallic surfaces, the glass plate may be dispensed
 with, replacing it by a perforated mirror of non-magnetic
 metal, and adjusting it so that the reflected light passes
 through the hole into the eye of the observer. The rotation
 observed with this arrangement is produced by reflection at
 the magnetized mirrors between the poles.
   V. Refutation of Fitzgerald's Theory of Rotation produced
                            by Reflection.
     Mr. Fitzgerald* has endeavoured to give an explanation of
 the rotation of the plane of polarization produced by reflection.
 Briefly stated, it is as follows:—Iron, upon magnetization,
 becomes circularly doubly refractive, just as diamagnetic sub
 stances in a magnetic field do. This circular double refraction,
 as has been shown above, is very considerable in the case of
 iron. Since the intensity of the light reflected by a body
 depends upon its index of refraction, right-handed circularly
 polarized light is reflected by magnetic iron with a different
intensity from left-handed. Plane-polarized light may be
 regarded as consisting of equal quantities of right-handed and
 left-handed circularly polarized light. Starting from this
point, Fitzgerald endeavours to show that plane-polarized light
falling at any angle upon a magnetic surface is converted by
reflection into elliptically polarized, and that in general the
major axis of the ellipse must be rotated towards the direction
of oscillation of tho incident light. For normal incidence
upon the pole of a magnet, however, it is easily seen that the
angle between the plane of oscillation of the incident light
and the major axis of the ellipse is zero. Mr. Fitzgerald
therefore himself draws the following conclusion from his
theory:— If plane-polarized light falls normally upon the pole
of an electromagnet not excited, and if after reflection it be

 320      Prof. A. Kundt on the Electromagnetic Rotation
 quenched by a nicol, then upon exciting the electromagnet
 the field should become bright This brightness should not
 disappear upon any rotation of the analyzing nicol, but should
 increase, whether it be rotated to the one side or to the other.
    To this my experiments are directly in opposition ; inas
 much as, when the electromagnet was excited, the analyzing
 nicol had always to be rotated through a definite angle in
 order to obtain good extinction. Whether the extinction
 itself is absolute with homogeneous light, and consequently
 whether the reflected light remains strictly plane-polarized or
 whether a certain small amount of ellipticity results, cannot
 of course be decided. In any case Fitzgerald's theory is
 refuted by the experiments at normal incidence, and it is
 therefore not necessary to discuss the admissibility of the
assumptions upon which it is based. The question how far
Voigt's theory on the reflection of light at circularly pola
rizing media is applicable to our case may remain undecided
for the present.

Rotation of the Plane of Polarization upon Oblique Reflection of
      Light from the pole-surfaces and side-faces ofa Magnet.
    For these experiments a large electromagnet with erect
legs of iron was employed. These had a height of 47 centim.
and a diameter of 11 centim. Each leg was provided with
three coils of wire 3 millim. thick : each coil had a resistance
of about 0"65 Siemens unit. Two large iron parallelepipeds
served as poles. The magnetizing current was furnished by
the Gramme machine, and had usually an intensity of 16 am
peres. Since the experiments were made in winter, when the
sun was little to be relied upon, a Drummond lime-light was
employed as source of light. The readings of the analyzing
nicol were taken upon a divided circle graduated into quarter-
degrees, reading with the vernier to 4 minutes, although
the reading could be estimated to 2 minutes with certainty.
   The angle of incidence of the rays of light upon the reflect
ing iron surface was carefully read oft' upon a divided circle.
The plane of polarization of the polarizing nicol was adjusted
as exactly as possible in the plane of incidence or at right
angles to it, as determined by the good extinction of the light
by the analyzer. When the magnet was excited, it was gene
rally not possible to get rid of the light which now passed by
rotation of the analyzer ; since after reflection the light, was
no longer plane-polarized, but elliptically polarized. It was
always adjusted to the minimum of illumination, so that the
plane of oscillation of the analyzing nicol was brought at
right angles to the long axis of the rotated elliptical rays.

   Since the rotations are very small in amount, it was neces
sary, in order to obtain results in any measure reliable, to
multiply the observations. As a rule, tour observations were
taken for each angle of incidence, for each of the two positions
of the plane of polarization, viz. in the plane of incidence and
at right angles to it. In each of the four observations the
polarizer was adjusted afresh, and ten readings taken with
each direction of the current. In the following a rotation is
called positive, as before, when it has the same direction as
the projection of the amperian molecular currents upon a
plane at right angles to the ray of light.
                   First Series of Experiments.
   A circular iron mirror, of the dimensions given above, was
employed. The iron pole-pieces were adjusted at a distance
of 29 millim. from each other, and maintained at this distance
apart by means of a block of wood inserted between them.
The mirror was placed sideways upon the magnet-poles, so as
to touch each through a distance of 3 millim. The magnet
was thus closed through the steel mirror. The reflecting
surface was placed vertical. The angle of incidence J is
the angle between the incident rays and the normal to the
mirror.
   The following Table gives the results obtained. The sign
= denotes that the plane of polarization (the long diagonal of
the nicol) is parallel, and the sign X that it is at right angles
to the plane of incidence.
   The amount of rotation is given in minutes. Since each
number is the result of eighty separate adjustments, the tenths
of minutes are given,.although the error may amount to several
tenths of a minute.

while when the planes are at right angles the rotation changes
sign for an angle of about 82°.

Kerr gives.
                  Second Series of Experiments.
   An exactly similar series of experiments was made with a

plated with nickel. The following values were obtained :—

              75-0             -1-1             -1-9
   With nickel also the direction of rotation remains the same
for all incidences = , but for the position _|_ changes its sign
between 50° and (i0°.
   The amount of rotation is, on the whole, perceptibly smaller
than with iron. This is in agreement with what was said
above as to the ratio of the rotatory power of nickel to that
of iron.
   In order to test whether any perceptible distortion or bend
ing took place when the magnet was excited, the images of
a vertical and horizontal millimetre-scale were observed by
means of a telescope in the manner already described. When
the current was established, there occurred always a very
slight displacement, and also a small bending of the mirror.
The latter was inferred from the fact that the divisions and num
bers of the scale between became somewhat indistinct. These
displacements and distortions were, however, extremely slight;
and the same whether the current was sent in the one direc
tion or in the opposite. They could not therefore have exerted
any perceptible effect upon the observed rotations. Besides
the complete series of observations described, a large number
of separate observations were made with the various mirrors
under various conditions. They were all in complete agree
ment with the numbers of the above tables. The following
may be quoted :—

              of the Plane of Polarization of Light.           323
   Another steel mirror, similar to the one used for the series
of experiments, gave at an angle of incidence of 650,3,
                       =                   J.
                     -8'-6               +9'-0
   This mirror was then electroplated with silver. Upon estab
lishing or reversing the current there was no perceptible
brightening of the Held.
   The pole-pieces of the magnet were then put into contact,
and the mirror which was to be examined was placed at the
side of the magnet, but without touching it. For this pur
pose mirrors of non-magnetic metal and platinized glass
were employed which had been electrolytically coated with
a thin film of iron. An accurate examination of the satne by
means of the scale and telescope showed not the smallest dis
placement or distortion when the magnet was excited. A
rotation was observed in every case, as was to be expected
from the results given in the above tables. Thus, for ex
ample, a glass mirror coated with iron gave for an angle of
incidence of t>5°, when the iron-coated side was about 2 millim.
from the side of the magnet, the following rotations :—
                    -8'-l                +13'-0
   A rotation could still be observed when the mirror was at a
distance of 45 millim. from the side surface of the magnet.
   I havo made also a number of experiments on the rota
tion produced upon oblique incidence on the end faces of a
magnet. The arrangement was the samo as that employed
by Kerr. Platinized glass coated with iron, cobalt, or nickel
was used in every case. The mirror was fastened in front of
 the plane-pole of an electromagnet without touching it, and a
pointed pole (submagnet of Kerr) brought near to the mirror.
 If the plane of polarization coincided with the plane of inci
 dences, then for all incidences the direction of rotation is
 opposed to that of the magnetizing current if we imagine tho
 reflected ray of light rotated in the line joining the poles.
    If the plane of polarization is at right angles to the piano
 of incidence, then at an incidence of about 80° the rotation
is also oppositely, but from 80° to 90° similarly, directed with
the magnetizing current. This reversal in the direction of
rotation, as already remarked, escaped Kerr's notice. Since
 I have not yet been able to make a complete series of obser
vations with one and the same mirror on the variation of
rotation with the angle of incidence, I defer giving numbers
for the present.

 Rotation of the Plane of Polarization of Light which has twice
    traversed a glass plate and been reflected at the back sur
    face of the plate.
    The phenomena of reflection of light from metals have led
 to the view that the light upon reflection penetrates into the
metal to a certain depth. This easily suggests the suspicion
 that the rotation of the plane of polarization of light which
 has suffered reflection from magnetic metallic surfaces arises
 in the very thin layer which the rays traverse upon reflection.
 A theory of rotation upon the assumption of the penetration
 of the light would be difficult to establish.
    We may, however, easily state matters so that, in general
 at least, a process takes place analogous to that of reflection at
 metallic surfaces, upon the assumption of the penetration of
 light. Suppose that we have a glass plate in a magnetic
 field : let rays of light fall upon it at any angle of incidence.
 The rays are refracted into the glass, traverse the plate, are
 reflected at the back surface, and alter traversing the plate a
 second time are refracted out of the glass.
     If we have the amount of the electromagnetic rotation of
 the rays by glass given, then, by help of Fresnol's formula
 for reflection and refraction in isotropic bodies, the total rota
 tion which the plane of polarization has suffered in the plate
 can be calculated. We will consider the following special
 case, which is analogous to our previous experiments on rota
 tion at the side-faces of a magnet.
    Let the lines of force of the magnetic field in which the
 glass plate is placed be parallel to the plane of the plate. Let
the thickness of the plate be d, and the electromagnetic rota
tion per unit length in the direction of the linos of force be <£.
 Let the plane of polarization of the incident light coincide with
the plane of incidence, and be parallel to the lines of force.
Then, if Fresnel's formula for refraction at the first surface
and reflection at the second surface be employed, the angle 7
through which the plane of polarization is rotated upon emer
gence from the plate—if i and r represent the angles of inci
dence and refraction, and if the electromagnetic rotation in
the plate is so small that the angle, its tangent, and its sine
may be considered identical—is given by the formula
                                     sin isin r
                  tan7 = 2^tan7-s,(._ry
Since all the factors of <j> are positive, 7 has the same sign as
<f> for any value of i. For i=0, 7 = 0. The rotation of the

plane of polarization which the glass plate shows upon excita
tion of the magnetic field thus varies, no doubt, in magnitude
with the angle of incidence, but always takes place in the same
direction as the electromagnetic rotation which the rays suffer
in the plate.
   If, on the other hand, the plane of polarization of the light
before its entry into the plate is at right angles to the plane of
incidence, if wo adopt the same symbols, and if the electro
magnetic rotation is again small, then the rotation x, suffered
by the plane of polarization upon emergence from the plate, is
given by the formula

    If i + r< 90, x is negative; but if i + r>90, x is positive.
    For t + r=90, that is, for the polarizing angle, £ = 90; but
 in this case the amplitude of the light is zero.
    The case considered above was examined experimentally in
the following manner :—The poles of the large electromagnet
were adjusted at a distance of about 3 centim. apart. A glass
plate, the walls of which were not accurately parallel, so that
the rays reflected from the back surface were well separated
from those reflected at the front surface, was placed against
the vertical side-faces of the poles so that it connected them.
 The plane of incidence of the light was horizontal. The
angles of incidence were read off upon a large divided circle.
    The following double rotations were obtained upon exciting
the electromagnet at different angles of incidence for the rays
 reflected at the back surface.
    The signs = and _|_ denote, as before, that the plane of
 polarization of the incident light is parallel or at right angles
 to the plane of incidence. The rotations are given in degrees.

    The polarizing angle of the glass (t + r = 90°) was found to
 be56°-4.
    A similar series of experiments was made, with the two
 poles of the electromagnet pushed close together and the glass
 plate placed against the side surface of the closed magnet.
     The rotations were similar to those given above. There is
 consequently a complete analogy between the phenomena
 obtained with the glass plate and the previously given obser
 vations of reflections at the side-faces of a magnet.
     In that case, as in this, when the plane of incidence and the
 plane of polarization coincide all rotations have the same sign.
 If, however, the plane of polarization is at right angles to the
 plane of incidence, then, with metals as with glass, the sign
of the rotation changes—for glass at the polarizing angle
(5f>°-4), for iron at about 80°, for nickel at about (30°.
    Nevertheless we have the difference that, with the magnetic
metals the direction of rotation is the opposite to that in the
case of glass. If it is not allowable to assume that it is proved
by this analogy that, upon reflection at metallic surfaces, the
light penetrates to a small depth into the metal, and that the
rotation takes place in the thin layer which the reflected rays
traverse, yet the phenomena of rotation observed upon reflec
tion at the side of a magnet admit of being brought under a
simple and uniform expression. The fact that the light rotated
upon oblique incidence on metals does not preserve its con
dition of plane polarization, but becomes elliptical, has beeii
shown above.
    Instead of bringing our glass plate up to the side-face of a
magnet, we may bring it in front of the pole-surfaces so that
the lines of force are at right angles to it. The amount of the
rotation of the plane of polarization when the magnet is ex
cited may be calculated as a function of the angle of incidence
and position of the plane of polarization by means of Fresnel's
formula, as explained above. The result is that, when the
plane of polarization of the incident light lies in the plane of
incidence, the rotation always has the same sign, viz. positive ;
but when the plane of polarization is at right angles to the
plane of incidence, then from 0° up to the polarizing angle the
rotation is positive, and thence on to 90° it is negative.
    These phenomena are therefore exactly analogous to those
of rotation at the pole-surfaces of a magnet, with the difference
that we must ascribe a negative power of rotation to the
magnet.

   In the preceding I have given a general view of the electro
magnetic rotation of iron, cobalt, and nickel upon transmitted
and upon reflected light. A more exact investigation of the
dispersion due to rotation, of the dependence of rotation upon
the thickness of the layers in reflection, &c, must be reserved
for a subsequent occasion. Other questions suggest them
selves : as, for example, whether the rotation attains its
maximum with the induced magnetic moment, whether it is
possible to recognize a rotation produced by a thin metallic
film, which is permanently magnetized instead of being tem
porarily magnetized, &c.
   I will here, in conclusion, only collect together the facts
now known of the electromagnetic rotation of the plane of
polarization. We will, as usual, designate a rotation in the
direction of the hypothetical amperian molecular currents,
which represent at the place in question the magnetic field
actually present as positive, and an opposite rotation as negative.
   1. Most isotropic solid bodies, fluids, and those gases which
have been examined rotate the plane of polarization in the
positive direction.
   2. A concentrated solution of ferric chloride produces a
negative rotation. The negative rotation of other magnetic
salts is recognized by the diminution in the positive rotation
of the solvent.
   3. Oxygen, which is comparatively powerfully magnetic,
produces positive rotation, as shown by Herr Rontgen and
myself.
   4. The plane of polarization of light which traverses iron,
cobalt, and nickel is rotated in the positive direction.
   5. According to Kerr, negative rotation is produced upon
normal reflection from a magnetic pole. The same has been
shown above to hold good for cobalt and nickel.
   6. Upon passing through, as well as upon reflection from,
iron, the rotational dispersion of the light is anomalous—that
is, red rays are rotated more powerfully than blue ones.
   7. The complicated phenomena which take place npon
oblique reflection from the pole-surfaces, or side-faces of a
magnet, may, as shown above, be brought together by the
assumption that, in reflection, the light traverses a very thin
film of the metai, and that negative rotation is produced by

     XXXVI. Experiments on tfie Velocity of Sound in Air.
                       By D. J. Blaikley*.
                              [Plate VII.]
 I HAVE to bring before you tbis afternoon tbe results of
       a few experiments carried out in continuation of the
 series brought to your notice last November. Before con
 sidering the velocities obtained, however, it may be well to
 show by experiment the reason for the doubt in my mind as
 to the absolute reliability to be placed upon records obtained
from membranes as used by Regnault and Le Roux; and also
to explain a little more fully my reason for discarding the use
of organ-pipes, speaking under a considerable pressure and
with good musical tone, as used by Dulong.
    If we take a short tube, say 5 inches long, with a short
inner sliding-piece for adjustment of length, and close one end
with a diaphragm of gold-beater's skin, against which a bead
hung by silk falls, we have a very sensitive resonator for the
pitch of about 512 v. If this tube were closed by a rigid
material instead of by the skin, its length to give the maxi
mum resonance to the 512 v. fork would be about 6$ inches;
but on drawing the slide to make the tube of this length there
is no agitation of the bead : the maximum agitation of the
bead, at the present tension of the membrane, is found to be
when the tube is about 5 inches long. This is its most sen
sitive position ; but when the fork is vibrating strongly the
membrane will record its action, although the length of the
tube, from mouth to membrane, is somewhat greater, or less,
than is necessary for best effect. Applying this to the case
of a membrane stretched across a tube along which a single
wave is travelling, as in Regnault's experiments, it would
appear that the last possible record of the enfeebled wave
would be obtained from its point of maximum condensation ;
but a record of the wave in the early part of its course, when
it is strong, would be obtained from a point in the wave far
short of its maximum condensation ; so that the length mea
sured by means of the membranes, as travelled by the wave,
does not necessarily give the length passed over by a given
point in the wave in the measured time. The error, small aa
it would be when distributed over a great length, would become
more appreciable as the tube-length became shorter, and it
would in every case lead to an under-estimation of the velocity.

           Experiments on the Velocity of Sound in Air.                 329
   In Dulong's experiments care was taken to obtain pipes of
good tone ; but my experiments have convinced me that such
a tone is the worst possible for measurement of wave-lengths.
A good musical tone is not pure in the acoustical sense, and
the presence of the partials constrains the pitch of the prime to
some extent. If the form of pipe were such that its proper
tones agreed exactly with the harmonic series, there would
not be this difficulty of constrained pitch ; but as it would
have been exceedingly difficult to construct pipes of this
character, I determined to introduce a bulb or pear-shaped
portion between the speaking-mouth and the cylindrical tube
in which the sliding-plug worked (see Plate VII. fig. 1). By
this means tubes were obtained having proper tones quite out
of the harmonic order, and therefore capable of giving very
pure prime tones.
   In November last it was stated that the results obtained from
the 11*43 millim. tube were not very reliable. The experi
ments with this tube have been repeated, and a new tube of
88*19 millim. diameter has been introduced, completing a
series of five tubes, ranging in the proportion of 3 to 5, from
11-43 to 88*19 millim. diameter*. The results of the new
experiments are given in the following table :—

 332                       Mr. D. J. Blaikley on the
 factor y/^ 5 and if the influence of n is properly represented
 by ¦y/^> the mean of all the values of V should agree with V
 as obtained from »j and r2. The mean is 331*676 metres; and
 the latter value is 331*620, with which the mean is in very
  close agreement. The pairs of adjacent values t>4 and t-3 &c.
 are rather ill-conditioned for the determination of V : the best
  value of V should be from the extreme values of v—that is, the
  pair t-4 and r. This value is 331*603 —very little different from
  the value 331*620 obtained from v2 and vu where there is no
 variation in the value of \ / -. From these results it would
                                   V n
 appear that the influence of the vibrational rate of stationary
 waves in tubes upon the velocity is properly represented by
          j but as Lord Rayleigh, in the paragraph quoted, refers
 to Schneobeli's and A. Seebeck's investigations, based upon
 Kundt's experiments, we may calculate a value for V upon
 their determinations. According to these observers, when n
 varies, the diminution of velocity is proportional rather to
 ^/I than to <y/i.                Taking the pair of velocities v and vi}
 and substituting -y/^-3 for                 i, we get V = 334*439—mani
 festly too high, and very different from 331*620, the value
 obtained from the pair i\ and i-s.

   In the diagram (Plate VII.) the curve given by the figures
in Table VII. is laid down, and also the observed and calcu
lated values given in Table VlII. To these are added curves
for 130, 520, and 1040 vibrations.
   In addition to the experiments of which the details are
given, many trials were made in the course of adjusting the
apparatus. Some of these trials were at pitches other than
those finally adopted ; and although such results were of no
value for exact comparison, the general bearing of them was
quite in agreement with the results tabulated. One of these
preliminary trials was a set of five observations with the tube
of 52*91 millim. diameter (r3) at the pitch of 260. The mean
result was a velocity of 330*27, in place of 329"94 as on
Table VII. This trial was made with the tube before the
introduction of the bulb-mouth ; and the third partial tone
was perceptible to the ear, so that the prime may have been
influenced a little thereby.
    The notes were all purposely kept very weak, so that the
excess of pressure in the tubes when sounding, above the
 barometric pressure, must have been very small indeed. In
 one of the large tubes (r3) a water-pressure gauge was intro
 duced ; but the pressure was barely measurable, certainly not
 exceeding ^0 inch of water. In the calculations I have there
 fore assumed that the influence of intensity might be neglected.
    The chief conclusions to which these experiments appear to
 lead are the following:—
    1st. The tubes used for the measurement of wave-length,
 as determined by the length between nodes, must speak with
 a pure tone ; or
    2nd. If partials are present, the tubes must be of such
 form as to have their proper tones in exact agreement with
 the harmonic series. (Neither of these conditions is easily
 attainable with ordinary organ-pipes.)
    3rd. The air-blast must not constrain the pipe to speak any
 other pitch than its natural pitch of resonance.
    4th. In smooth tubes the diminution of velocity is propor
 tional to r~' and to n~$, as determined by Helmholtz.
    5th. The velocity V in free air for sound-waves of low
 intensity, or just audible, is 331*676 metres at 0° C.
    6th. The ratio between the two specific heats of air, as
 deduced from the Newtonian velocity 279*955 metres, and V
 as above 331*676 metres, is 1*4036.
    As there is perhaps room for some doubt about the influence
 of n being properly represented by n-*, I have not attempted

334               Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
to employ KirchhofFs equation in place of Helmholtz's ; but
in abler hands than mine, the experimental results may per
haps be of some assistance in determining one or more of the
points involved in these formulas.
           XXXVII. On the Surface Forces in Fluids.
  By A. M. Worthington, M.A., Clifton College, Bristol*.
                               [Plate VTII.]
 1. rT^HE object of the following paper is to deduce from
            consideration of the internal equilibrium of fluids
the fact that at their bounding-surface there is a rapid varia
tion of density, on account of which the surface layers exert
 either a tension or a pressure on any material wall which
 cuts them transversely, from which action all the known
 phenomena of capillarity are easily deduced ; and to exhibit
 clearly the manner in which the intrinsic energy per unit
 of volume of the surface layers exceeds or falls short of the
 intrinsic energy of the unit of volume in the interior of the
 liquid; and also to point out a certain important change
 which it is necessary to introduce into the commonly accepted
 explanation of the equilibrium of a fluid in contact with a
 solid; and, finally, to show why the erroneous assumption
 by Laplace of a constant density near the surface did not
 prevent him from obtaining the correct equation to the liquid
surface.
    That a variation of density will usually take place at the
 surface of a liquid was indeed admitted by Laplace t; but the
 variation was not taken into consideration in his theory, nor
 was it# significance perceived by him, but seems first to have
 been pointed out by PoissonJ, in whose investigation all
 necessary considerations are taken into account. But the
 methods of Poisson leave much to be desired in point of sim
 plicity and directness ; aud to many readers the issue must
 appear unnecessarily obscured by mathematical difficulties.
 Moreover, he did not realize—perhaps it was impossible before
 the researches of Quincke that any one should realize—
 that the one quantity which alone we can measure experimen
 tally is a surface-tension; and consequently he did not aim at
 froving the reality of its existence. Yet the argument which
    shall make use of follows so naturally from the considera
 tions adduced in his chapter " Sur la Constitution intime des

Corps," that it may be said to be founded upon the ideas
which are there so lucidly set forth.
    Before the development of the modern theory which
ascribes the phenomena of heat to molecular motion, it was
customary to regard a solid or liquid at rest as composed of
an indefinitely large number of discrete molecules, themselves
also at rest; and physicists, such as Young and Poisson, did
not hesitate to frame theories which should account for the
statical equilibrium of such molecules. The phenomena of
cohesion and adhesion required that the molecules should be
endowed with an attractive force which was a function of the
distance between them, and which vanished when the distance
became sensible; while the phenomena of elastic resistance to
compression, and of expansion with a rise of temperature, led
to the description of a repulsive force of heat which was sup
 posed to be exerted between adjacent molecules. The mole
 cules of a homogeneous solid were supposed to be of equal
 mass and of equal efficiency as centres of force, and to be
uniformly distributed throughout the interior of the solid. A
 varying state of stress corresponded to variations from uni
 formity in the arrangement of the molecules, while fluids were
 distinguished from solids by the supposition that the internal
 equilibrium of the latter was influenced by the shape as well
 as by the situation of the molecules ; while in the case of the
 former, owing either to the sphericity of the molecules or to
 their relatively great distance of separation, consideration of
 their shape was unnecessary.
     The properties ascribed to the molecules were those which
 seemed simplest, or which were most obviously suggested by
 analogy with phenomena in which finite masses of matter
 were concerned. No attempt was made to explain how the
 molecules acquired these properties of attracting or repelling
 each other at a distance.
     The properties must not, however, be regarded as so many
 additional hypotheses about the molecules, but rather as a
 part of the conception of stationary molecules, which obser
 vation of phenomena proved to bo necessary.
     A large number of phenomena, however, especially those
  belonging to gaseous pressure, diffusion of gases and liquids,
  and to evaporation, were not explainable by the supposition of
  stationary molecules, but seemed to demand that they should
  be regarded as endowed with motion; and this opinion, which
 received so great an encouragement from the discovery of the
  mechanical equivalent of heat, is now almost universally
  accepted.
      But the change of the point of view has, as is often the

836               Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
case, its disadvantages as well as advantages. A multitude
of phenomena of the classes mentioned receive an easy expla
nation ; but the explanation of others has become more trouble
some than before. The mere mathematical difficulty of dealing
 with a number of molecules in motion renders it impossible,
 on the supposition of molecular motion, to frame a satisfactory
 theory of internal equilibrium in solids or liquids. We are
 obliged therefore either to invent new methods, or to return to
 the old point of view; and it is important therefore, while
 the more energetic minds are inventing new statistical methods
 of dealing with molecules and substituting the new conception
 of a transfer of momentum for the old one of a " force," to
 examine the statical theory to ascertain whether a perfectly
 philosophical use may not be made of it. For it often happens,
 in the observational sciences, that the hypotheses of one theory
  are completely represented in corresponding hypotheses of
 another theory, and that the results of the one can be trans
 lated into the language of the other ; so that an impartial
  observer will regard the hypotheses of either rather as con
  ventions between which there may indeed be some choice on
  the ground of convenience and suitability, than as statements
  of fact whose truth or falsehood is at issue. Now, it is easy
  to see that the relation between the statical and dynamical
  molecular hypotheses is one of this kind, and that to the pro
  perties which we assign to the molecules on the one theory
  there are corresponding properties assigned on the other.
     Thus, in either, the molecules are regarded as attracting each
  other with a force which is a function of the distance only,
  independent of the temperature and vanishing when the dis
  tance becomes sensible. On the statical theory the molecules
  are supposed to be kept apart by a repulsive force which varies
  with the temperature, and which is also a function of the
  distance, but which turns out to be exerted only between
  adjacent layers of molecules. On the dynamical theory the
  equivalent property is the motion itself, combined in some
  forms of the theory with an elastic repulsion between mole
  cules in collision, causing them to separate again (various
  subordinate hypotheses having been suggested to account for
  this latter property). And the explanation of the difference in
  molecular structure between fluids and solids offered on the
  one theory also corresponds closely with that belonging to the
  other.
      And, again, it is significant to observe that, so far as the
   internal equilibrium of substances is concerned, the concep
   tion of molecular motion stands in the same relation to the
   statical conception as the modern theory of a dielectric does

                      Surface Forces in Fluids.                   337
 to the earlier notion of action at a distance between electrified
 bodies. For, on the statical theory, we regard the equilibrium
 of any two parallel layers of uniformly distributed molecules,
 sufficiently near to act upon each other, as maintained by
 forces of attraction and repulsion acting across the empty
 intervals which separate them fropi the intervening molecules;
  while, on the dynamical theory, we account for the latter of
  these two forces by what is equivalent to a pressure arising
  from the momentum of these intervening molecules, which
  thus constitute a medium the action of which replaces one of
  the actions at a distance ; and it is well known that in the
  case of electricity the results of the earlier theory are all trans
  latable into the language of the later.
      And it is pertinent also to remember that it is a common
  artifice in dynamical problems, as for instance in Planetary
  Astronomy, to make abstraction of the motion of a portion of
  the system by the introduction of a repulsive force. In the
   present instance the whole system probably consists of a
   number of molecules in motion which, being endowed with
   attractive forces, would, but for their motion, fall together.
   If we are to imagine them stationary, and at the same time
   to preserve the external characteristics of the system, we must
   introduce the repulsive forces.
      I have thought it well to preface the argument which
   follows by these remarks, since there is a tendency to forget
   or disregard results obtained by the statical theory, because
   the language in which they are expressed is thought to be out
   of harmony with the newer conceptions.
      In the arguments which follow it will be found that, while
   dealing with solids and liquids, I have preferred to use the
   conception of separate molecules, and to speak of the intra
    molecular distances as decreasing or increasing with the
    application of external pressure or tension, though the argu
    ments would equally well have permitted me to speak of
    elementary volumes and variations of density: in fact, that
    it is not till the subject of gases is considered that it
    becomes necessary to speak of molecules. It appears to me,
. however, that, apart from the desirability of adopting through
    out the paper the same system of describing phenomena,
    there is an advantage in choosing a method which shows that
    the conclusions arrived at in the case of solids and liquids are
    consistent with the assumption of molecular discontinuity,
    should it be necessary to make that assumption.
       2. In order to realize clearly the nature of the molecular
    conceptions on which the Theory of Capillarity is based, let
    us imagine a homogeneous cube of a solid or liquid substance

338               Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
(it is not at present necessary to distinguish), and with each
surface subject to the same pressure.
   If this pressure be increased, we know that the volume
of the cube diminishes; and since the diminution is propor
tional to the volume, it follows that, if we have regarded the
cube in the first instance as composed of an indefinitely large
number of similar separate uniformly distributed molecules
the sum of whose masses is the mass of the whole cube and
whoso masses are independent of their situation, we must
now regard the intramolecular distances as uniformly dimi
nished throughout the cube ; and since a definite increase of
pressure results in a definite contraction of volume after which
the solid again reaches a condition of equilibrium, we may
attribute to the molecules a repulsive force which increases as
the intramolecular distance is diminished.
    If, keeping the volume constant, we raise the temperature,
the pressure exerted by the faces of the cube is increased,
and wo infer that the repulsive force between the molecules
increases with the temperature of the body.
    Since, again, a lowering of the temperature is attended
by a uniform contraction of volume even when the external
pressure is zero, we infer that the contraction is due to an
intramolecular action equivalent to an attractive force, and
that the expansion accompanying a rise of temperature is due
to the repulsive action overbalancing this attractive force, and
since the expansion of the substance results in the attainment
 of a condition of equilibrium in which the attractive and
 repulsive actions must be equal, we conclude that the repulsive
 action diminishes more rapidly with an increase of molecular
 distance than does the attractive force, and that, conversely, the
 repulsive action increases taith a diminution of distance more
 rapidly than the attractive.
    It may, however, be urged here that the facts mentioned
 thus far would bo equally well accounted for on the sup
 position that the repulsive force increased with an increase in
 the distance between the molecules, but that the attractive
 force increased more rapidly. This, however, would require
that the repulsive force should diminish as the temperature is
 raised, a supposition which it would be very difficult to re
 concile with what we know of the nature of heat, and which
 we must therefore reject. Indeed it is important to remember
 that, in framing a statical theory of molecular equilibrium, our
 choice of alternative hypotheses may sometimes be guided by
 information which we possess as to the nature of the dyna
 mical phenomena for which we are seeking an equivalent
 representation.

                    Surface Forces in Fluids.                  339
   It will be observed, however, that, so far as we have gone,
there is nothing to tell whether the attractive force increases,
decreases, or is constant for a diminution of distance.
   We are unable to separate with certainty the repulsive
action we have spoken of into two parts, one of which might
be due to the temperature and the other to what might
be called an inherent elasticity of the molecule. The whole
action was called by Poisson and writers before him " the
repulsive force of heat "—a phrase which, because it is not
entirely in harmony with the modern theory of molecular
motion, has fallen into disuse.
   Unfortunately the important relation between phenomena
which it served to express has also been lost sight of. What
ever the repulsive and attractive forces and the intramole
cular distances that we are speaking of may turn out to be,
we may be quite sure that what used to be called the repulsive
force of heat does in solids and liquids vary with alterations
of molecular distances more rapidly than does the force of
molecular attraction. It is on this fact, clearly pointed out both
by Young and Poisson, that the whole theory of capillarity is
based. I shall therefore not hesitate to use the phrase " repul
sive force of heat" precisely as it was used by Poisson, to
signify the whole of the repulsive action of which I have
spoken. Those who recognize in the phenomena of molecular
diffusion and heat-conduction evidence that the internal pres
sure not only in gases, but also in homogeneous solids and
liquids, is really due to a transfer of molecular momentum
taking place equally in opposite directions across any ele
mentary area within the substance, will have no difficulty in
perceiving that it is of this transfer of momentum that " the
repulsive force of heat " is the statical equivalent, and that in
assigning equal efficiency as a centre of force to each of the
molecules we are really dealing with the matter statistically.
   3. It is evident that but for the attractive forces between
the molecules none of the phenomena of cohesion and adhe
sion could take place; and in the case of solids we are able to
derive from observation of the breaking-stress some knowledge
of the numerical value of the difference between the two
forces.
   We may, consistently with the phraseology wo have used,
regard a vertical solid bar of uniform section and subject to no
atmospheric pressure as composed of horizontal layers of mole
cules, the distance apart of which layers is determined partly
by the temperature of the bar and partly by the tension to
which it is subjected. Let us fix our attention on the action
across a plane horizontal section between the molecules at

340              Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
each side of that section above and below it. If there is no
tension, the position of equilibrium of the molecules is such
that the attractive cohesion-forces and the repulsive force of
heat across the section are equal. In my own mind the con
ception of what is going on is rendered more vivid by thinking
of the analogy with two men who compress a spring placed
between them by pulling each other together. The force
with which they draw each other together is equal and oppo
site to the reaction of the spring by which they are thrust
apart.
   Now let the bar be stretched: the intramolecular distance
is increased, and, by what we have seen, the repulsive forces
are on this account diminished, while of the cohesion-forces
we as yet only know that they must now be greater than the
repulsive forces ; and the equilibrium is now of a different
kind : the resultant action across the section is now attrac
tive ; and since there is equilibrium, the molecules at either
side of the section must be pulled apart by the action of
molecules further away. The analogy which in my own
mind gives vividness to the conception, is that of two men
endeavouring by pulling at each other to compress a spring
(now Aveaker than before) which is placed between them, while
they themselves are somewhat pulled apart by others exerting
less power than themselves. It is necessary for equilibrium
that the cohesive force exerted across the section shall be
equal to the sum of the tension and the repulsive heat-force;
and the fact that we can increase the tension up to a certain
value, the " breaking-stress," and not beyond, shows that
after a certain point this condition ceases to he fulfilled.
   If we write T for the tension per unit of area across the
section, C for the cohesion per unit of area, and E for the
repulsive action per unit of area, then C = T + E or T=C— E
is an equation which holds for all values of T between 0 and
the breaking-stress; but for an extension of the body greater
than that corresponding to the breaking-strain, C— E is less
than the breaking-stress. In other words, with an increase of
molecular distance the quantity (C — E) increases up to a
certain maximal value, beyond which an increase of the mole
cular distance is attended by a decrease in (C — E).
   Also we have seen that E diminishes with the extension;
and that for extensions less than that corresponding to the
breaking-strain its diminution is more rapid than that of C.
Now it is evident that no maximal value could be attained by
(G — E) if C continually increased, remained constant, or
continually diminished less rapidly than E ; but that there
would be a maximal value if 0, alter increasing, remaining

                      Surface Forces in Fluids.                        341
constant, or diminishing more slowly than'E, were to begin to
 diminish more rapidly.
    4. The significance of this result may be exhibited graphi
cally with great advantage*.
    Let 0 X and 0 Y be rectangular axes of coordinates, and
along 0 X let distances be taken proportional to the distance
between adjacent layers of molecules for different states of
extension of the solid, and parallel to 0 Y let lines be drawn
proportional to the attractive and repulsive forces in the inte
rior of the liquid per unit area respectively at some given
temperature. In this way we should obtain curves of attrac
tion and of repulsion, the latter of which, from what we have
seen, will slope downwards towards the axis of X; while the
 former may be represented by a curve such as that shown in
fig. 1, which, after sloping less rapidly than the curve of repul
 sion, cuts that curve, and finally has the more rapid slope of
 the two. Let P be the point of intersection, P M the ordinate
 at P, and let N be the foot of the ordinate which cuts the
 curves where their tangents are parallel to one another.
    If the intramolecular distance is less than 0 M, repulsion
exceeds attraction, and equilibrium is only possible when
there is an external pressure equal to the difference of the
 ordinates to the two curves. If the intramolecular distance 0
 exceed 0 M, then equilibrium demands an external tension.
At the extension indicated by 0 N this tension reaches its
maximum value; and it is evident that the equilibrium is
unstable, for beyond this distance a diminution of volume
will mean an increase of attraction. The breaking-stress is
therefore proportional to the difference of the ordinates at
N. We shall afterwards return to this point when we come
to consider the equilibrium of a liquid in contact with its
vapour.
    5. It is here only necessary to remark that the argument
 from the existence of the breaking-stress may be extended to
liquids. For though we are prevented from determining the
breaking-stress of a liquid in the same way as that of a solid
 by difficulties depending on the conditions of stability of
liquid figures, yet there are many indications, derived partly
 from the adhesion to the top of a barometer-tube of a column
 of liquid more than barometric height, partly from the mag
 nitude of the elastic resistance to compression, partly from the
 difficulty of starting ebullition in the interior of a liquid, and
partly from capillary phenomena themselves, that the breaking-
 stress, if it could be determined, would in many cases be a
   * I owe to my friend Prof. Riicker the first suggestion of the graphical
illustrations made use of in this paper.

 342              Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
quantity comparable with that of the metals themselves, while
the extension corresponding to it would still be a very small
fraction of the total volume of the liquid.
    As regards the distance to which the attractive action of a
molecule extends, it is customary to say that at all sensible
distances the action is zero ; and to regard the molecule as
situated at the centre of an imaginary sphere whose radius is
called the radius of molecular action, and whose surface marks
the limit beyond which the cohesive attraction of the molecule
is insensible, within which it is sensible.
    It is to be observed, however, that inasmuch as a distance
or an action which is insensible in one experiment may be
sensible in another, the value of the radius of molecular action
as defined in this way would probably vary with each expe
riment in which it is concerned. But we shall not require a
more precise statement in the present investigation. Nor is
it at present necessary to examine whether the number of mole
cules contained within the sphere of molecular action be great
or small. The reasons which will afterwards appear for re
garding this number as great rather than small are derived
chiefly from capillary phenomena themselves.
   Again, as regards the repulsive force, which is of the nature
of an elastic reaction varying with the temperature, it is not at
once apparent whether it is to be considered as exerted only
between adjacent layers of molecules, or whether it extends to
molecules separated from each other by intervening layers.
    In the argument which follows we shall proceed upon the
former supposition, the justification of which will be better
understood after it is seen in what manner either hypothesis
enters into the discussion.
    6. In order to prove that the molecules of a liquid near the
surface are in the condition which corresponds physically to a
state of tension, let us select some non-volatile liquid, and
imagine the molecules deprived of their attractive or cohesive
action and of their repulsive action, and to be distributed at
equal distances from each other, those at the surface lying in
the same horizontal plane. Now let us endow each molecule
with the attractive force which we ascribe to it in nature.
Each molecule now exerts an attraction over those of its
neighbours which fall within the radius of molecular action.
We will suppose that the uniform distance which we have
arbitrarily selected as that which shall separate adjacent mole
cules is small in comparison with the radius of molecular
action, a condition which (for reasons that will afterwards be
detailed) we believe to obtain in the mass of the liquid in
nature. Let us select a molecule A at the surface, and

                    Surface Forces in Fluids.               343
imagine that we describe about it as centre a sphere of radius
equal to the radius of its molecular action. The molecules
which exercise on this surface-molecule any attractive action
are contained in the hemisphere at whose centre it is situated.
From the symmetry of their distribution it is evident that
their total resultant action is vertically downwards, also that
the resultant action of each successive layer of molecules on
the central one which we are considering is vertically down
wards. We do not know the law according to which the
attraction between two molecules varies with the distance.
The only assumption we shall make is, that within the limits
of variation with which we shall deal the attraction does not
increase with the distance.
    Let Fj represent the vertical component due to the action
of the first adjacent layer on the molecule A, F2 that due to
the second layer, F3 that due to the third, and so on.
    The last term to be considered is the nth or F„, where n is
the number of times that the distance between consecutive
layers is contained in the radius of molecular action.
    Now let us introduce between the molecules such repulsive
forces as shall be consistent with the maintenance of equili
brium at the uniform distance apart which we have assigned,
and let us proceed to examine what ibis repulsive force
must be.
    The total action downward on the surface-molecule A which
we are considering is
                  F, + Fs + Fs +      + F„=XF.
    If its equilibrium is to be maintained, it must experience a
 repulsive pressure upwards equal to 2F, and every molecule
 in the surface-layer will be similarly acted on.
    Also, since we cannot but suppose that to the action there is
an equal and opposite reaction, the repulsive pressure on the
first layer upwards is equal to that on the second layer down
wards ; and since the uniform distribution with which we have
started implies that there are the same number of molecules
in each layer, the repulsive pressure downwards on each mole
cule (B) of the second layer is equal to the upward pressure
on each molecule A of the first.
    Now let us consider the attractive actions on a molecule (B)
 of the second layer. These are SF downwards and Fj upwards;
 and therefore, taking into account the repulsive pressure from
 above, the total resultant action downwards on (B) is
             22F - Fx = Fi + 2F, + 2F, +        + 2F»,
 and to maintain equilibrium it is necessary that this should

344              Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
be the repulsive reaction between (B) and the third layer;
and this exceeds the repulsive reaction [(1) (2)] between A
and the second layer by the amount
                   Fs + F3 + F4 +        + F„.
   Again, the total attraction downwards on every molecule C
of the third layer is 2F. The repulsive pressure downwards
is 2SF — Fu and the upward attraction is Fi + Fj. Therefore
the total resultant action downwards is
     32F-2F1-FS=F1 + 2F, + 3F, + 3F4+                + 3F„;
and to maintain equilibrium this must therefore be the repul
sive reaction [(3) (4)] between each molecule C and the
fourth layer ; and this exceeds the repulsive reaction [(2) (3)]
by the amount F3 + F4 + .... + F,,.
   Similarly, the repulsive action [(4) (5)] between the fifth
layer and a molecule of the fourth will exceed the reaction
[(3) (4)] by the amount F4 + F6+                +F„, and that
between the n + lth layer and a molecule of the nth will
exceed that between the »ith layer and a molecule of the
(»— l)th by the amount F„, after which the excess will be
zero. It is thus seen that, in order to maintain the equili
brium, the repulsive reaction between consecutive layers
must increase with the distance from the surface till a depth
equal to the radius of the molecular action is attained, after
which a constant value is required.           1
   7. Now let us assign to the liquid such a temperature as shall
maintain the molecules in the interior at the distance apart at
which we have placed them.
   The repulsive reaction is now too great to maintain the
equilibrium of the molecules near the surface. If left to
themselves, these molecules will recede from one another, and
those at the surface will recede furthest. In other words, the
density of the liquid will diminish as we rise to the surface;
and it is evident that such a condition is one of stable equi
librium, and therefore permanent. For by the increase of
distance the repulsive heat-force diminishes, as we have
seen, more rapidly than the force of cohesive attraction.
   We may either suppose the readjustment of the mole
cules near the surface to involve only an increase in distances
parallel to the surface, while the distance between adjacent
layers measured normally to the surface remains the same
as in the interior of the liquid ; or, on the other hand, the
adjustment may involve an increase in molecular distances
both parallel and perpendicular to the surface. The latter
supposition is the more general, and, as we shall see later, is

                     Surface Forces in Fluids.                345
 the most easily reconciled with the phenomena' of evapora
 tion ; and though either hypothesis wili lead us to the same
 results, we shall find no reason for supposing that the pres
 sure at any point near the surface of a liquid, whether within
 the liquid or in the vapour contiguous to it, is not equal in all
 directions, and shall therefore keep before us the latter of the
 two hypotheses ; though the reader should bear in mind that
 in the conclusion we have now arrived at—that in a non
 volatile liquid exposed to a vacuum there must be a diminu
 tion of density as the surface is approached from within—
 the other interpretation of the phrase " diminution of density "
 is possible. Now, if we desired to diminish the density of the
 interior of the mass of liquid, keeping its temperature all the
 time the same, so as to reduce its molecules to the same
 condition as at any given very small depth below the surface,
 we could do it by stretching the liquid. But to say that the
 condition of the molecules near the surface is that into which
 we should reduce the molecules of the interior by establishing
 among them a state of tension, is equivalent to saying that
 the surface-layers consist of liquid which differs from the
 liquid in the interior by being in what we call a state of ten
 sion ; and it is evident that the tension increases as the
 surface is approached.
    And it is further obvious that this tension will be exerted
 on any solid wall cutting the surface. For if we imagine a
 homogeneous cube of solid or liquid matter held in a state of
 isotropic tension by adhesion to solid walls, we perceive that
the molecular condition which corresponds to equilibrium
between the wall and the stretched mass is one of a tension on
the wall. A solid wall, therefore, which cuts through the
liquid surface so that part is above and part below the surface
 will only be in equilibrium with the layers near the surface
when tbe portion in contact with them is in a state of ten
sion ; and the argument holds equally well if liquid wall be
substituted for solid. (It is also to be observed that a plane
solid surface laid horizontally upon the liquid surface will, if
we adopt the more general supposition, also experience a
tension at the first moment of contact.)
    Two solid walls connected by a liquid surface will there
fore be drawn together, and, if capable of motion, will abso
lutely move towards each other. Their motion involves the
diminution of the liquid surface between them, which in turn
requires that many molecules which have previously been so
near the surface as to be separated by greater distances than
those in the interior are now brought into the mass of the
liquid, and their distance apart diminished. Now the exten-
   Phil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 18. No. 113. Oct. 1884.        2A

3i6                 Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
sion of a solid or liquid substance by an external force involves
in general a fall of temperature ; the release from tbe state of
tension and consequent contraction involves a rise of tempe
rature. Consequently the beat-energy necessary to endue the
less dense surface liquid with its given temperature is more
than sufficient to maintain this liquid at the same temperature
when its density is assimilated with that of the mass of the
liquid. The contraction of tbe surface is therefore accom
panied by an evolution of heat^energy and a rise of tem
perature; and the surface-layers may be regarded as a portion
of the liquid on which extra heat-energy has been spent in sej>a-
rating the molecules against the action of cohesive forces.
    8. We have, for the sake of clearness, first supposed the
liquid to bo non-volatile, so that the surface should have above
it a vacuum entirely without action on the liquid below. We
will now proceed to the more general caso of a liquid (a)
 in contact with some second substaneo (ff).
    Let the surface of separation be a horizontal plane, and
let us think of (a) as tho lower substance, and let us imagine
the second substance (/3) to have its molecules uniformly dis
tributed and rigidly connected so that a pressure or tension
 is transmitted through it without producing any appreciable
change of density, while we examine what must be the condi
tion of equilibrium of the liquid (a) in the neighbourhood
 of the surface. We shall also suppose that tbe liquid (a) has
 its molecules uniformly distributed at first, and they are en
 dowed with the cohesive attraction which they would possess
in nature. We will, as before, use Fj to signify the resultant
vertical attraction between any molecule of (a) and tho
 adjacent layer; F2, F3, . . . . F„ for the corresponding action
 between each molecule and more distant layers, and, as
 before, we will write Fi + F2 + F3 +            + F„=2F.
    The action between            and (a) may be regarded as made
 up of the action of each molecule of (a) on each layer of mole
 cules of (/S), if we write <f>Al for the action between any molecule
 A of the surface-layer of (a) and the first layer of (/3), <f>Aj for
 the action between the same molecule and tho next layer of
 (/3), and so on.
    We may write 2<£A=#Ai +4>a, + 4>a, +               +<£a„ for ^°
 whole action of (/S) on the molecule A.
    Similarly, the action of any molecule B of tho second layer
 of (a) on the substance (/3) will consist of a number of similar
 terms of which an appropriate symbol for the first will be
 £b,» since it expresses the attraction between the molecule 13
 and the lowest layer of molecules in (/S), which is the second
 adjacent layer abovo it.

                    Surface Forces in Fluids.                    347
  And we may write the whole action
                  2<£„ = <£bs + #b, + </>«, + • • ¦•
Similarly,
                  20c=<£c, + <£c +
oxpresses the action between the substance (/8) and a moloculo
C of the third layer; and if there bo, in the substance a, nl
molecules per unit of area, the total action of (0) on (a) per
unit of area may be written >t2j"2$; and since the second
substance (/3) is in equilibrium with the uppermost layer of
(a), this must be equal to the repulsive reaction downwards
on each unit of area of the uppermost layer of (a). Therefore
the pressure on this layer is ft2 J 2<£ per unit of area, or j*2<£
per molecule; and the total action on a molecule A of the first
layer is therefore made up of J 2<£ (downwards) + 2F (down
wards) — 2</>A (upward); and this must therefore be the value
of the repulsive pressure between the second layer of the
liquid (a) and every molecule A of the first layer; or, using
previous notation,

348                 Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
and for the repulsive reaction between the (r+l)th layer and
a molecule R of the rth layer, we have
        [to ('+!)] = *V+ Fr+1 + . . .-(*Br+^+l + ...)*•
   Now if %F > £<£A, t. e. if the action of the liquid (a) itself
on a surface-molecule is greater than that of the substance
beyond the surface, we may assume Fx > <f>Ai, F3 > <f>Aj and so
on. For this will be the case if the condition 2F>£<£A is
due, on the one hand, to a less density of the molecular struc
ture of the substance (/S), or, on the other hand, to a smaller
intrinsic energy in the molocules of (/?) ; or, thirdly, to both
of these causes combined; and it is difficult to conceive of any
other cause than one of these.
   In this case the value of each of the expressions
          [(2)(3)]-[(l)(2)], [(3)(4)]-[(2)(3)J, &c.
is positive ; and equilibrium at a given temperature can only
be obtained by an increase of repulsive reaction (i. e. of den
sity) as we descend into the substance.
   If, again, 2F = 2$A in such a manner that
then it is evident that we have at the opposite sides of the
surface two substances in which the physical properties with
which we are concerned are identical, and the value of each
of the expressions [(2) (3)] — [(1) (2)] &c. becomes zero, and
the density at each side of tho surface is everywhere the same,
and there is no surface-tension.
    If, on the other hand, 2F<X$A, the substance Q3) must
Live, owing either to greater density or to greater intrinsic
energy of its molecules, a greater action on a surface-molecule
of A than the liquid itself, and we may assume that any term
F„ is greater than the corresponding term <f>A ,oi<f>B, or <f>c^}
&c. Therefore the value of each of the terms
         [(2) (3)] - [(1) (2)],     [(3) (4)] - [(2) (3)], &c.
   • The meaning of this result may with advantage be illustrated by the
geometrical diagram (fig. 2), which will not require explanation. The
downward attraction on the elementary volume A may be written 2p"F;
the upward attraction 2«"#. If there is to be equilibrium, the dilTer-
ence of these two must be balanced by the difference in the repulsive
pressure on the upper and lower surfaces of the elementary volume.
  If (/3) is exchanged for a vacuum, ^?"# = 0, which gives the result
of the first case.

                    Surface Forces in Fluids.                 349
will be — ve, and equilibrium can only be attained by a de
crease of density in the liquid (a) as we pass inwards from
the surface. In this case therefore the liquid (a) will be
condensed upon the surfaco of the substance (/3); and its
surface-layers will exhibit, instead of a tension, a pressure,
and the surface of contact will tend to enlarge itself, the liquid
in the neighbourhood of the surface possessing, per unit of
volume, less energy than the liquid in the interior.
   9. Now that we know how a liquid of uniform density, to
start with, would behave if placed in contact with a uniform
substance, we can tell how two different liquids, each supposed
uniform to start with, will behave when placed in contact with
each other. There will be a readjustment of each near the
surface in the direction either of an extension or a compression
according as what may, for brevity, be called the mutual
attraction of the liquids is less or greater than what we may
call the self-attraction. We shall return to this result after
examining the equilibrium at the surface of a gas or vapour.
   It is necessary, before we can decide how far our results
apply also to vapours and gases, to extend to their case the
same statical treatment which we have used with liquids.
   10. When the temperature and pressure of a gas are such
that it is far removed from its point of liquefaction, we find
no trace of any attraction between the molecules, but only of
repulsion ; and we may regard the phenomena of gases from
a statical point of view by considering the molecules to be
beyond the radius of each other's molecular attraction, but not
beyond that of molecular repulsion, which latter force now
varies inversely as the volume, and therefore inversely as the
cube of the molecular distances.
   That we know, in the case of gases, something of the
dynamical conditions which produce what wo are calling the
repulsive force, need not prevent us from adopting the statical
point of view, which may also be regarded as statistical.
   If the temperature be below what is called the critical tem
perature of the gas, we can, by sufficiently increasing the
pressure, liquefy it, and the liquid will only exist as such so
long as the pressure above it is maintained. In fact, the
interior of a liquid in equilibrium with its own vapour is in a
state of compression. There is, however, nothing in this that
is inconsistent with the rarefaction of the surface-layers, as
mav be seen from the following considerations.
   For we may imagine that upon the surface of a non-volatile
liquid exposed to a vacuum one or more additional layers of
 molecules are laid, which molecules will be attracted down
wards by an excess of cohesive force, and will therefore exert

350        ,     Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
a pressure on tho layers immediately below ; but the down
ward action is accompanied by an equal and opposite upward
attraction exerted by the new molecules on those below, so
that no additional pressure (other than that due to gravitation)
will be transmitted to a sensible depth, and the only effect will
bo to shift upwards the condition of surface-extension. What
were previously tho first, second, third layers, Ac, are now
each at a greater depth below the surface, and the molecular
distances are in each case diminished, but are still greater than
in the interior of the liquid, unless the number of new layers
added be so great that the original surface lies now at a sen
sible depth within tho liquid. Then, and not till then, the
condition of rarefaction will disappear. Now the mechanical
 pressure, such as that which we may conceive to be produced
 by the impacts of a gas above the liquid surface, differs from
 the pressure wo have described in not being attended by an
 equal upward attractive action, and consequently its pressure
 will be transmitted to the whole liquid mass below, but tho
 amount of diminution which it produces in the rarefaction at
 any point near the surface will bo less than that produced in
 the way described, if the mechanical gaseous pressure is less
 than the increase in cohesive action at that point due to the
addition of the new layers.
    Now our knowledge of tho value of the surface-tension, and
of tho smallness of the depth to which it extends, obliges ua
to conclude that the extension to which, as we have seen, it is
due is such as must be attended by a diminution of cohesive
action so considerable as to be far greater than any gaseous
pressure to which liquids are exposed in our experiments on
 surface-tension. Consequently the rarefaction of the surface-
 layers, even in a direction normal to the surface, will bo
 diminished by such pressure, but by no means destroyed.
 Thus we shall have the pressure of a gas above transmitted
 through rarefied layers to the liquid below, just as, conversely,
a solid wall may condense a rare liquid at its surface, and yet
 a mechanical tension may be transmitted through the wall
and condensed layers to the liquid beyond.
    Let us now examine what would happen if the outermost
molecules of a liquid, with a vacuum above its plane surface,
were at such a distance from the next layer that the least
oscillation outward would carry them beyond the range of
molecular attraction of the rest of the liquid. The position is
one of unstable equilibrium with respect to such oscillations,
and the molecules, unless absolutely stationary, will escapo
into the space beyond, where they will, considered from a
statical point of view, exert only a repulsive force, will arrange

                     Surface Forces in Fluids.                 351
themselves at uniform distances apart, and will exercise a
pressure on the surface-molecules of the liquid, which, by
causing them to approach the interior molecules more closely,
will render their position one of stability for indefinitely small
oscillations. For more considerable oscillations, however, the
position of the remaining surface-molecules will still be one
of instability : hence, if the molecules are subject to such
oscillations, still more will evaporate, and the pressure of the
vapour above the liquid will increase, and this will go on till
an equilibrium is attained, as it evidently ultimately will bo,
both on account of the increase of pressure and of density in
the vapour.
    Let us now suppose the volume to be diminished, so that
the pressure is increased. The molecules of the vapour can
readjust themselves to such increased pressure, so also can
those of the, liquid ; and the new equilibrium of liquid and
vapour under increased pressure will obviously bo stable,
provided that the molecules of tlie gas are not in their turn sub
ject to oscillations. If, however, a molecule of the gas be
 carried to a position nearer the liquid than that to which a
liquid molecule may oscillate and yet be in equilibrium, it
 will evidently not return, and there will be a condensation of
vapour into liquid. Hence, by admitting that the gaseous
molecules also are liable to sufficiently great oscillations, wo
see that a reduction of pressure to the original amount will
take place. If the reduction goes beyond this the rarefaction
of the surface-layers will increase, so that a smaller oscillation
of a liquid molecule will suffice to secure its escape, which
points to a condition of stable equilibrium. It may be re
 marked also that the pressure of a different gas above the
liquid will, by its pressure, increase the stability of the sur
face-molecules, and thus retard evaporation.
    11. If we now return to the graphical representation of
 attractive and repulsive forces, which wo have seen reason to
 believe to hold good for liquids as well as for solids, we find
 that at the extension corresponding to the breaking-strain the
 attraction-curve is above the repulsion-curve, and begins to
 slope more rapidly. Hence, if this condition continues, tho
 curves must again cut one another, and the repulsion-curve
 be uppermost. In other words, a state will ensue in which
 repulsion exceeds attraction. Now this is what wo find in a
 gas, but, further, in a perfect gas repulsion diminishes with
 an increase of volume, a condition which can only be repre
 sented by the repulsion-curve sloping more rapidly than tho
 attraction-curve. Hence, if the gaseous and liquid states are
 continuous, there must bo some distance, such as OQ (fig. 3),

352              Mr. A. M. Wortliington on the
at which the two curves are again parallel. Now it is verv
interesting to remark that for any extension between those
indicated by N and Q the equilibrium is unstable: for between
N and the ordinate to the second intersection a diminution of
volume is attended by an increase of attraction, while between
the ordinate to the intersection and Q an increase of volume
is attended by an increase of repulsion. The first corresponds
to the oscillation of liquid molecules outwards, the second to
the oscillation of gaseous molecules towards the liquid.
   Hence we see that, when a liquid is in contact with its
vapour, there is a limit, on the one hand, to the rarefaction
possible for the former at the surface, and, on the other hand,
to the condensation possible to the latter—a result which
explains the sudden transition from the density of the liquid
to that of the vapour. Within these limits the rarefaction
and condensation will evidently still take place ; -for the con
ditions of the investigations which we gave for the contact of
two liquids are, so far as the denser liquid is concerned,
unaltered, except by the presence of a mechanical pressure,
which, as we have seen, will not affect the character of the
result ; while the vapour which is substituted for the less dense
liquid of the investigation fulfils the one essential condition
that the pressure-curve shall slope more rapidly than the
attraction-curve—the fact that it, too, is in a state of pressure
not affecting the result. If the dilatation near the surface of
the liquid only took place parallel to, and not also normally
to, the surface, the equilibrium of the liquid molecules for
outward oscillations would be much more stable ; but we
know that when a liquid is passed up into a barometric
vacuum the evaporation is extremely rapid, a fact which indi
cates that the surface-layers are very near the limit of stability
with respect to outward oscillations, and which confirms the
supposition that the dilatation takes place in all directions.
   We are thus led to the conclusion that a solid wall cutting
the surface-layers of a liquid transversely will experience a
pressure due to the vapour and a tension due to the liquid
near the surface, the resultant action being the difference
between the two.
   12. Since a solid whose surface is exposed to a gas does
not exhibit the phenomenon of a surface-tension—for its
edges and angles are not rounded as they would be were the
surface-tension efficient in modifying the figure of the solid—
we must conclude that the internal friction among its mole
cules permits a state of strain to exist between the surface-
molecules and those in the interior. Thus if we were
suddenly to expose the interior of a mass of water to the air,

                    Surface Forces in Fluids.               353
the molecules of the liquid near the newly exposed surface
would at once readjust themselves to the new conditions of
equilibrium, receding from each other and absorbing heat.
But if we did the same to a solid, it is very probable that the
readjustment of the intramolecular distances would not take
place. The experimental evidence that at the surface of solids
there exists a layer of condensed gas is very strong; and
just as a gas may be liquefied by an external pressure, so
it is possible that the molecular pressure caused by the
attraction of the solid may condense on its surface in a liquid
form some or all of the gases contained in the atmosphere to
•which it is exposed. It is to be expected that the gases of
our atmosphere which are most readily liquefied by pressure,
viz. water-vapour and carbon dioxide, are those which will
be most condensed at the surfaco of solids exposed to it; and
in experiments in which the liberation of the condensed gases
is effected, it is these which may be expected to appear in
greatest quantity. With respect, however, to those gases
whose critical temperature is below that at which capillary
experiments are usually made, it is to be observed that,
although they will be condensed at the surface of a solid,
yet the outer surface of the condensed stratum will not
exhibit the phenomena of a surface-tension. For the experi
ments of Andrews and Ramsay, which are confirmed by
 Cailletet and Jamin, show that above the critical temperature
the densities of the gas and the liquid are identical. Hence
in the case of such a gas there will be a continuous though
very rapid diminution of density in the condensed stratum
as we pass outwards from the solid surface into the un
 modified gas beyond. Nowhere can the condensed film
be in a state of tension, for we have seen that the state
 which we call the surface-tension is due to the molecules
 being in the condition to which we could reduce the molecules
 of the interior of tho liquid by stretching. But a liquid
 which is only kept liquid by pressure above its critical tem
 perature cannot sustain a tension. For let us imagine a
 portion of such a liquid enclosed within solid walls, and then
removed for experiment, and let the experiment consist in
 mechanically enlarging the space enclosed by the walls.
 The liquid will expand, and will pass without breach of con
tinuity into a gas which will continue to expand, but will
continually exert a pressure, and never a tension, on the
 enclosing walls. For this statement of the continuity of
liquid and gaseous conditions above the critical temperatnre
 we have experimental evidence.
    13. Now it is interesting to observe that our diagram of

 354              Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
 tho repulsion- and attraction-curves leads us to anticipate this
 condition of things ; for we know that an increase of tempera
 ture, when the volume is kept constant, involves an increase
of pressure, which implies that the ordinates to the repulsion-
 curve must be everywhere increased, but most to the left-
hand end of the curve, since the increase of pressure when the
volume is kept constant is far greater in a solid or liquid than
in a gas; thus an elevation of temperature implies a bodily shift
ing of the whole curve upwards with an increase in the slope as
we approach the left-hand end. Now the shifting alone would
lift the curve quite above the curve of attractions (see fig. 4),
which would mean that above a certain temperature, repulsion
would always exceed attraction, or that the substance could
 only exist under pressure. There would still, however, be
the same region of instability as before, and consequently the
surface of discontinuity between liquid and vapour would still
exist ; but by a sufficient increase in the slope of the repulsion-
 curve, such as we have seen will also take place, this region
of instability will diminish and finally disappear (see fig. 5)
when the slope of the repulsion-curve is everywhere greater
than that of the corresponding part of the attraction-curve.
At the temperature at which this takes place all discontinuity
will disappear, and the substance will be in the same condition
throughout. Up to this point the liquid will still exhibit
within the vessel in which it is contained the phenomena of a
surface-tension, though in reality the wall of the containing
vessel will experience, after the temperature has been reached
at which the repulsion-curve ceases to cut the attraction-curve,
only a pressure even where it cuts the liquid surface. But
the pressure will be less here than elsewhere, for our original
investigation always holds within the limits for which the
slope of the repulsion-curve is greater than that of the curvo
of attractions. Thus it is probable that the meniscus observed
at the surface of liquefied oxygen or nitrogen does not corre
spond to a true tension as in the case of water or mercury.
    14. If our method of dealing with the continuity of the
liquid and gaseous states be compared with that of Professor
James Thomson (as quoted on pages 124-126 of Maxwell's
' Theory of Heat it will be seen that the ordinates to the iso
thermal curves there given correspond to tho difference of tho
ordinates to the two curves in the above investigation—that,
in fact, the horizontal axis of coordinates in Maxwell's diagram
(which is reproduced in fig. G) represents our attraction-
curve. The suggestion which Professor Thomson made thir
teen years ago—that the portion A 13 C of the curve, which wo
know from experimental evidence to represent the conditions

                     Surface Forces in Fluids.                355
of the liquid, and the portion GrHK, which we know to
represent conditions of the vapour, are not really discon
tinuous, but are joined by a portion C D E F G, of which tho
part between D and F must be unstable—is very similar to
our own argument from the two curves.
    The advance that we have been able to make on Professor
Thomson's suggestions is, that we have shown that it is a
necessity of the equilibrium of the liquid that near the sur
face it shall be less dense than is indicated by the point C, t. e.
that the curve does pass below this point. Further, that, in
the case of liquids whose vapour-pressure at the given tempe
rature is not enormously great, there is near the surface a
region of true tension—that is, that the curve passes below the
 horizontal axis of coordinates in Maxwell's diagram; while by
 the argument from the breaking-strain we see that, after a
 certain volume has been reached, the corresponding tension
 diminishes, i. e. wo have experimental evidence of the existence
 of the curve down to and even beyond tho turning-point D.
 Again, by showing that it is a necessity of equilibrium that
 the vapour should bo condensed at tho surface of the liquid,
 we have been able to prove that the vapour really exists there
 in the condition indicated by tho curve between G and F.
    Thus Professor Thomson's suggestion (see Maxwell's
 ' Heat,' p. 127) that such a state of things as is indicated by
 his hypothetical part of the curve " may exist in some part
 of the thin superficial stratum of transition from a liquid
 into its own gas, in which the phenomena of capillarity take
 place," is shown, by our method of considering the question,
 to have been a correct anticipation.
    We may now observe, with respect to the hypothesis which
 we have used throughout, viz. that the repulsive force is only
 exerted between contiguous layers of molecules and not be
 tween moro distant layers, that this conception of tho force
 is tho only one by which we can represent statically the phe
 nomena of impact by which we believe the repulsive action
 to be really due. The choice of this hypothesis is, in fact,
 ono of those to which wo are guided by our knowledge of
 tho dynamical phenomena ; and this fact itself, and the com
  pleteness with which the hypothesis serves to express tho
 phenomena, points to the correctness of tho choice, which
 could be further justified by showing that any moro general
 hypothesis would not express the phenomena without tho
 introduction of complicated restrictions.
     15. Tho next step which it is necessary to take is to show
  that tho investigation we have given would be in no way
 affected if the surface of tho liquid were curved instead of

356               Mr. A. M. "Worfhington on the
plane, provided that at every point the least radius of curva
ture is very great in comparison with the radius of molecular
 action.
    Let a sphere whose radius is the radius of molecular action
be described about any molecule A at the surface of a liquid,
and let the figure (fig. 7) represent a section of the curved
surface containing the normal to the point A and the least
circle of curvature, and letB and C be the intersections of the
surface with the sphere ; PAQ the section of the plane tangent
at A whose intersections with the sphere are P and Q. Then,
if the radius AP is very small in comparison with the least
radius of curvature, the portion of the curve BA.C is not to
be distinguished from the least circle of curvature, and BP or
CQ is very small in comparison with AP; and if a similar
normal section through A were made in any other plane for
which the radius of curvature was greater, the points corre
sponding to B and C would be still nearer to the tangent-
plane. Also, if a smaller sphere were described about the
molecule A whose intersections in the plane of the paper
with the curved surface were b and c and with the tangent-
plane p and q respectively, then the ratio of the distance bp
to the radius Ap would be less than the ratio of BP to AP,
and the same would be true for any other normal section
through A.
   Now, in the investigation we have given, the terms F„ F2,
F3, &c, have represented the action, on a given molecule, of
successive horizontal layers of molecules ; and it is evident
that if each layer, instead of being flat, were bent so as to
be parallel to the slightly curved surface, the difference in the
action of each molecule of the layer, and therefore of the whole
layer on the given molecule, would be negligible in compa
rison with the whole action of the layer.
   Again, the tension at any small depth below the surface
has been shown to be due to the variation, from the value in
the interior, of the repulsive action which it is necessary to
establish at that depth among evenly distributed molecules if
equilibrium is to be maintained, and the readjustment of the
molecular distances by which the equilibrium is secured in
nature has, as we have seen, the effect of diminishing the
repulsive action still further, and of thus increasing the differ
ence between its value at the given depth and the value in
the interior.
   Now the difference between the repulsive action of the first
and second layers was seen to be
                      Fa + Fs + F« +          ;

                        Surface Forces in Fluids.                        357
for an even distribution of molecules, and after self-adjust
ment it will be still greater.               Similarly, the difference
between the repulsive action of the second and third and
that of the first and second layers will be greater than
                            F3 + F,+              ,
and so on.
    Therefore the difference between the repulsive action in the
interior and that between the first and second layers is greater
than
                         F3 + 2F3 + 3F< +
Similarly the difference between the repulsive action in the
interior and that between the second and third layers is
greater than
                        F3 + 2F4 + 3Ft+                ,
 and so on for greater depths.
    And we have seen that no term of any of these expressions
 has its value sensibly altered by the curvature of the layers,
 and consequently the value of the tension at any depth will
 not be sensibly altered by the curvature, and the same reason
 ing is obviously applicable to the more general case of the
 surface of contact of any two fluids *.
     16. We are thus led to the general conclusion that the
 layers of a fluid near and parallel to its bounding surface are,
 if the latter has a continuous and finite curvature, each
 mechanically equivalent to a perfectly flexible membrane, the
 tension or pressure on which is equal in all directions and at
 every point, and depends for its value* on the nature of the
 substances at the two sides of the surface. When two fluids
 are separated by a common surface of contact, the surface-
 tension, which is the subject of observation and measurement
 in physical experiments, is the algebraic sum of all the ten
 sions or pressures at the two sides of the surface acting on an
 area of insensible depth in either fluid.
      17. If we call one fluid A and the other B, then, if the
 mutual attraction between A and B is greater than what we
 have called the self-attraction of A, and also is greater than
     * It is to be observed that to obtain this result we have tacitly made
  use, for the first time, of the assumption that the number of molecules
  within the sphere of molecular attraction is great ; for otherwise a slight
  curvature of the layers might cause an important alteration in the num
  ber of molecules, and therefore in the mass of matter constituting the
  effective portion of each layer ; and the justification of the assumption is
  to be found in the fact that all the phenomena of capillarity show the
 surface-tension to be independent of the curvature of the surtace so long
 as the least radius of curvature is of sensible and measurable magnitude.

358                Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
the self-attraction of B, then each fluid will be condensed at
the common surface, which will therefore be in a state of
pressure. Now, as Maxwell has pointed out*, when this is
the case the surface must be unstable, for its extension in
volves an evolution of energy being aided by the molecular
forces, and the surface will therefore tend to enlarge itself by
puckering and replication. It is also probable that this
condition would involve what we call chemical action. If, on
the other hand, the mutual attraction between A and B is less
than the self-attraction of A, and also is less than the self-
attraction of B, then each fluid will be in a state of tension
near the bound ing-surface, which will therefore be in stable
equilibrium, and the experimental surface-tension will be the
sum of the two sets of forces.
   There remains the case in which one fluid is condensed and
the other rarefied at the surface. Here the two sets of forces
are of opposite sign, and the surface will be stable or unstable
according as the algebraic sum corresponds to a tension or to
a pressure. A liquid, in contact with its own vapour is, as wo
have seen, an instance of the former case 1\
   18. When, on the other hand, only one of the substances
is a fluid, the other being a solid, it is only the tension or
pressure of the former that can produce any motion or that
enters into experimental determinations; for forces normal to
the solid are balanced by the resistance of the solid, and forces
within the solid tangential to the surface cannot, owing to
the rigidity of the solid, cause a motion of its parts.
   Now in the case of the surface of contact of air and dense
solids, such as glass or a metal, there can be no doubt, as
wo have seen, that the air is condensed on the solid, and that
the surface-force within this fluid is a pressure, and from this
¦we are forced to conclude that whenever the liquid-angle of
contact between a liquid and a solid in air is acute (or 0°),
the liquid also is condensed against the solid, and that, of
the three surface-forces concerned, the greatest is the surface-
pressure within the liquid in the neighbourhood of the solid,
as is evident from a glance at fig. 8, which represents a
section normal to the surfaces in question in the neighbour
hood of the common line of contact 0. And it will be per
ceived that the spread of a liquid over a solid, as for instance
of a drop of alcohol over glass, is not quite the same pheno-
  * Encyclopedia Britannica, art. " Capillarity."
  t The latter case, perhaps, corresponds to liquids which mix without
chemical action ; for although, as Maxwell remarks, no case of puckering
has been observed, yet it is not evident that the phenomenon is one which
could bo observed or distinguished from diffusion.

mcnon as the spread of one liquid over another, for example
of a drop of alcohol over mercury; for in the latter case the
spreading is aided by the tension-forces within the mercury,
which cause a motion of its superficial parts, while in the
solid these forces are, as we have seen, rendered inoperative
by the internal friction. Moreover, we cannot decide in the
same way whether the observed value of the tension at the
common surface of the two liquids is a sum or a difference.
In the case of the solid it is evident that the liquid cannot
wet it unless it is condensed at the surface of the solid, t. e.
unless the attraction of the solid for the liquid is stronger than
that of the liquid for itself. If, besides, the mutual attraction
of liquid and solid is stronger than the self-attraction of the
solid, then the surface would be unstable but for the rigidity
of the solid. If this rigidity gradually gave way, the surface
of contact would extend, and the solid would mix with the
liquid.
     We thus obtain an explanation of the fact that a liquid
which dissolves or acts chemically on a solid always " wets "
 it, and are led to a view of the nature of tho beginning of
 solution much resembling that put forward by Mr. W. W. J.
 Nicol (Phil. Mag. Feb. 1883).
     When, on the other hand, the liquid-angle of contact with
 the solid is obtuse, as for instance with mercury and glass in
 air, it is not possible to decide in the same way whether the
 surface-force within the liquid in the neighbourhood of the
 solid is a tension or a pressure. If it is a pressure, then it
 follows that the surface-pressure of air on glass is even greater
 than the experimental surface-tension of mercury, which, of
 substances that are liquid at ordinary temperatures, exhibits
 the greatest of all the surface forces that have yet been
 measured. This result would seem to find some independent
 confirmation in the fact that glass is hygroscopic, and slightly
 soluble in water, which is generally present in the air in which
 the contact-angle is observed. Experiments on perfectly dry
  surfaces—such, for instance, as those of Quincke with freshly
 split laminaj of talc before they have had time to condense
 aqueous vapour upon themselves—throw some light on this
  point, the further discussion of which is, however, beyond
  the object of the present paper.
     19. I have aimed in this paper at proving directly, from
 consideration of tho elastic and thermal properties of solids,
  liquids, and gases, tho reality of the surface-tensions and
  pressure, since, from the principle of the surface-tension, if
  once admitted, when used in combination with the experi
  mental fact of hydrostatics, that in a liquid acted on by gravity

  the depth below or above the free horizontal surface*, all the
  phenomena of capillarity, the constancy of the contact angle,
  the horizontal motion of floating bodies, the equation to the
  liquid surface, and the laws which regulate the stability of
  liquid figures, may be easily deduced.
     It has not been necessary to assume with Maxwell f that
  the contraction of a liquid surface takes place in conformity
 with the principle of the conservation of energy, and to de
  duce the surface-tension from a combination of this assump
  tion with the molecular hypothesis. On the contrary, the
  fact that the contraction or extension of the surface which
  takes place is consistent with the principle of conservation of
  energy has flowed from the investigation itself ; and this, I
  think, is a considerable advantage, for the assumption of the
  conservation of energy, on which Maxwell bases his own in
  vestigation, does not carry with it in molecular matters the
 security of previous experimental justification : it appears as
 an additional hypothesis used in conjunction with the other
 hypotheses as to the nature of the molecular actions, but it is
 one whose exact relation to the other hypotheses is not easily
 perceived, since it is partly implied in them already, and it
    * An insight into the nature of the hydrostatic pressure, due to gravi
 tation at the earth's surface, and its connexion with the internal repulsive
force of which wo have spoken, is, I think, best obtained by the light of
 such a theory as that of Lesage, which attributes the gravitative action
 to the momentum of "ultra-mundane corpuscles."
    On such a theory we may regard any horizontal layer of molecules as
receiving a momentum from above, which would, in the absence of the
earth, be met by an equal corpuscular momentum from below; but, owing
to the earth's screening action, this compensating momentum is wanting,
and must be replaced by an increase in the molecular momentum, which
in the statical theory is represented by the repulsive force, and which is
obtained by a diminution of the distance between the layer under con
sideration and that next below it, to which tho effect of the corpuscular
momentum is thus transmitted; this next layer thus receives from above,
in addition to the corpuscular momentum proper to itself, a repulsive
pressure equivalent to tnat belonging to the former layer; and the sum cf
these must now again be balanced by an increase in molecular pressure
from the liver below, and so on throughout the liquid: thus there is an
increase of density and of molecular momentum, I. e. of internal repulsion,
as we descend. liut the increase of molecular momentum which is thus
substituted for the directed corpuscular momentum from below, cinnot,
from the nature of the motion in fluids, be supplied in one direction only,
and is therefore recognized as what we call the hydrostatic pressure
equally in all directions. It is thus seen that the hydrostatic pressure at
any point due to the weight of the liquid is the excess of the repulsive
force above the value which it would possess if the liquid were removed
from the influence of attracting bodies.

 do if the relation between its hypotheses were more easily
 apprehended.
    20. It is often a matter of interest to examine in what re
 lation one method of investigating a physical problem stands
 to another ; and I shall endeavour in what follows to make
 clear why the incorrect assumption of Laplace, that the den
 sity of the liquid is uniform, leads, from his method of con
 sidering the question, to the same equation to the surface of a
liquid as is obtained by Poisson, who takes the variation of
 density into account.
    If we examine, as did Laplace, the difference of the action
 on the upper portion of an elementary filament of unit section,
 normal to a liquid surface at 0 when the surface is curved, as
 along AOB (fig. 9), from the action when the liquid is bounded
 by the tangent-plane COD (which we will for convenience sup
 pose horizontal), we see that the difference is due to the excess
 or defect of liquid above or below the level of CD ; and the
 total differential action is due to the sum of actions between
all elements such as M of the canal and each of the elemen
tary volumes such as EF, into which we may suppose the
differential matter divided.
    Let us imagine it to be divided in the following manner: —
    Let the sphere whose radius is the radius r of molecular
action be described about the element M, and let spheres of
radius r—dr, r—2dr, &c. be also described about the same
point, so as to divide the differential matter under con
sideration into spherical shells of equal elementary thickness
dr. Again, imagine that there pass through OP a series of
vertical planes, the inclination of' each of which to the next is
the infinitesimal angle dO. The differential liquid comprised
between any two consecutive spherical surfaces is now par
titioned off into infinitesimal solid elements ; and if we confine
our attention to all the elements contained between a single
pair of spherical surfaces, we see that the dimensions of each
in the direction of the radius of the spheres is the same,
viz. dr, and in the horizontal direction at right angles to this
radius is the same, viz. Og x dO ; but in the remaining direc
tion EF, perpendicular to the other two, the dimensions of
each element are not the same, but will depend in each case
on the curvature of the surface. Now, provided that the
curvature of the surface is always such that the radius of
molecular action is insensible in comparison with the least
radius of curvature, it follows that that portion of any normal
section of the surface made through the point 0, which falls
within the sphere of molecular action described about any
   Fhil. Mag. S. 5. Vol. 18. No. 113. Oct. 1884.        2 B

362               Mr. A. M. Worthington on the
point M of the normal filament OP, cannot be distinguished
from the circle of curvature of the section in question.
    But if the radius of molecular action be insensible in com
parison with the least radius of curvature of the liquid at the
point 0, then the length EG will be insensible in comparison
 with the radius Mg, and the action of the element ~Eig on the
 element M may be regarded as taking place along any line
joining M to any point of EF; and this will be the case whether
 the density of the liquid be constant throughout EF or whether
 it vary, provided only that the variation is insensible for
 depths which are themselves insensible in comparison with the
radius of molecular action.
    Now, if the radius of curvature of the section containing the
 element EF were different, viz. r1 (but still so great that the
 radius of molecular action is insensible in comparison with it),
so that length EF of the element in question were to become
EF', then, since the change of curvature evidently produces
no change in any other dimension of the element, the ratio
EF to EF' is the ratio in which the volume of the element is
altered, and it is easily shown, from the geometry of the
circle, that
                        EF : EF' : : - : \.,
                                       r r
and the same is true for the corresponding element in the
section at right angles to the plane containing the line OP
and the element EB, or, using a corresponding notation,
                         E#:B*::I:£;
whence, adding these two ratios,
            EF + E<£:EF' + Etf>'::-+ - : -J + -,.
                                       r p r p
Hence, if we consider the attractions as proportional to the
volumes, we get that the attractions of any pair of cor
responding elements of the differential liquid, in planes con
taining the filament OP and at right angles to each other, is
proportional to the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of the
circles of curvature in those two planes.
   Now the sum of the reciprocals of the radii of the circles
of curvature at any point in any two planes at right angles to
each other is, by geometry, always equal to the sum of the
reciprocals of the principal radii of curvature, =g + j^; and
consequently the total integral action of the differential liquid
above or below the plane surface, being made up of pairs of

                      Surface Forces in Fluids.               363
terms each of which pairs is proportional to the quantity
(R      w}' '8 ^se^ proportional to this quantity ; and this
integral action is what is called the normal pressure or tension
at the point 0, due to the curvature of the surface ; and by
equating the expression thus obtained to the hydrostatic
pressure or tension at the same point expressed as a function
of the distance of the point from the level of the free hori
zontal surface, we obtain the well-known equation to the
liquid surface.
    It is to be observed that that part of our own investiga
tion in which we showed that the effect of the curvature on
the surface-tension was insensible, is equivalent to proving
that the action of the differential matter of the present instance
parallel to the surface is insensible in comparison with the
total tangential action. The existence of the effect normal to
the surface is, in our own investigation, a consequence of the
 inclination between consecutive elements of the surface.
    To ignore, as Laplace does, the variation of density near
 the surface is equivalent, as we can now see, to supposing
 the liquid to be inextensible and incompressible, or rather to
 supposing that the extension or compression near the surface,
 which we have found to be a necessity of the molecular equi
 librium, is insensibly small.
     Now, in our own investigation, it has not been necessary
 to inquire into the absolute value of the compression or
 extension at any point; such value must depend upon the co
 efficients of compressibility and of expansion with heat, f ad
 will be small when these are small ; and we may imagine our
 investigation to be made in precisely the same manner with a
 liquid for which both of these coefficients are insensibly small
 in all experiments. For such a liquid the uniform distribution
  of molecules, with which it was our method to start, must be
  only insensibly altered, but must still be altered near the
  surface to secure equilibrium, and a state of tension or of
 pressure will still be produced ; and we may still regard the
  free surface of such a liquid as a portion in which heat-energy
  has been spent in doing work agair :t molecular attractions,
  though, since one factor of the work (viz. the increase of
  molecular distance) has now become an exceedingly small
  quantity, the other factor (viz. the molecular attraction) must
   now be correspondingly large if the surface-energy is to
   remain a quantity of the same order as before.
      But if all liquids were like this which we are imagining, we
   should not have been able to make the experimental observa
   tions on expansion with heat and on compressibility necessary

364                  Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the
to establish the relation between the force of molecular
attraction and "the repulsive force of heat," on which our
whole argument has been based. This relation is, as we have
seen, the expression of a relation between observed quantities,
and is one which we must suppose to hold good even in the
limit where the observed quantities are vanishingly small.
Laplace, by confining his attention to this limiting wise, over
looked the relation, and accordingly failed to perceive the
reality of the surface-tension ; and his theory is in consequence
absolutely inapplicable to the explanation of any of those
phenomena of Horizontal motion on a liquid surface which are
due solely to variations of the surface-tension, and are not
necessarily accompanied by an elevation or depression of the
liquid.
XXXVIII. The Nature of Solution.—Part II. Boiling-Points
   of Salt-Solutions. By W. W. J. Nicol, M.A., B.Sc,
   F.R.S.E., F.C.S., Sfc, Lecturer on Chemistry, Mason Col
    lege, Birmingham* .
VERY little indeed is known of the temperatures at which
         salt-solutions of definite composition boil. Almost the
 whole of our knowledge is confined to the boiling-points of
 saturated solutions; and these have been determined in very
 many cases with but little pretence to accuracy. With the
 exception of the experiments made by Legrand f, nothing
 has been done to determine the effect on the boiling-point
 of water produced by the presence of various quantities
 of salts dissolved in it. The vapour-pressure of water from
 salt-solutions of various strengths has also received but little
 attention; the results of WiillnerJ, Babo, and one or two
 others comprising all that is known on this subject.
    From the time when I began first to work at the subject
 of solution, it appeared to me that it was in this direction that
 most knowledge of the nature of solution was to be gained ;
 but it is only recently that I have been able to turn my attention
 to this point. The following pages contain an account of my
 experiments on the pressures under which saturated salt-solu
 tions boil at different temperatures. These experiments are
 merely preliminary to a more extended and more accurate
 series of determinations of the pressure of aqueous vapour
 from such solutions. Still the results of these first attempts

are so striking and so totally at variance with all received
ideas on this subject, while they agree so completely with the
theory of solution put forward by me in the paper of which
this is the continuation*, that I feel they possess sufficient
interest, and are of sufficient importance, to warrant their
publication.
   My method of experiment is as follows :—
   A wide test-tube A, 200 millim. by 30 millim., is fitted with
an india-rubber cork through the centre of which passes a
thermometer B. By a hole at the side of the thermometer is
attached the upright condenser C: this is made of thin-walled
wide glass tube, and is surrounded with a cylinder through
which cold water flows ; the upper end of the condenser com
municates with the T-piece D, one arm of which has a stop
cock, and the other is connected with a piece of capillary
tubing E, 100 millim.
long and about -3 mil
lim. in internal diameter;
this in its turn is joined
to the gauge E, and has
a stopcock H by means
of which the whole may
be placed in communica
 tion with the atmosphere.
 The gauge stands side by
 side, in a trough of mer
cury, with a barometer-
tube G- in front of a
 mirror-scale divided into
millimetres, the pressure
of the vapour in A being
 given by the difference
 in height of the mercury
 in Gr and F. In making
 an experiment, a quan
 tity of salt along with a
 piece of granulated zinc
 or tin is introduced into A, and water sufficient to rather more
 than cover the bulb of the thermometer is then added. The
 quantity of salt is so great that some of it remains undis
 solved at the highest temperature reached during the experi
 ment. The tube is then placed in position and surrounded by
 a bath of water, the temperature of which is governed by a
 thermostat. The temperature of the water is then raised to

366                Mr. W. W. J. Nieol on the
5° above the point at which the vapour-pressure is to be
determined. The temperatures at which determinations were
made were 65°, 75°, 85°, 95°, as indicated by the thermo
meter B. The temperatures of the bath were therefore respec
tively 70°, 80°, 90° and 100°. The temperature of the bath
having become constant, the stopcock H is closed and D is
opened, communication with a water-pump being thus estab
lished. As soon as ebullition has commenced, D is closed and
opened occasionally till the reading of B is one degree or so
lower than the temperature of experiment. After steady boil
ing for some time, H is momentarily opened ; the temperature,
as indicated by B, rises immediately a tenth or so: in this way
the temperature of ebullition is slowly raised till the desired
point is reached. The heights of F and G are then read, and
 one observation is completed. D is again opened and closed
and the whole operation repeated ; and the mean of the two
differences in height of the mercury in F and Gr is entered as
the pressure of water-vapour at t° from the salt-solution
 saturated at t°. Two observations are also made with another
 quantity of the same salt. Thus the results entered in the fol
 lowing tables are based on four determinations. The use of
 the capillary E is to deaden the oscillation of the mercury in
 F, which would otherwise be produced by the brisk-ebullition
 in A. Tims the reading of F gives the mean of the momen
 tary pressures in A, as the thermometer shows the mean of
 the momentary temperatures. The piece of granulated zinc
 or tin is added to obviate bumping ; and it is practically un-
 attacked, as only a trace of dissolved metal could be detected
 after even four hours' boiling.
    As these experiments were merely tentative, no attempt was
 made to correct the temperature-readings nor the readings of
 the barometer ; and necessity for this was to a great extent
 removed by making a series of observations with pure water
 and comparing the results with the figures calculated from
 Regnault's experiments.
    Table I. contains the figures I obtained from two sets of
 double determinations. As is seen from it, my results are
 uniformly lower than Begnault's by 7*25 ± '5 j but as no
 attempt was made to read closer than *5 millim., the con
 cordance is satisfactory; and it is only necessary to apply as
 corrections the numbers in the difference-column to the
 pressures of water-vapour of salt-solutions afterwards given,
 to obtain the true pressures at the true temperatures.
    In Table II. are given the results I obtained corrected as
 above, and the temperatures to which these pressures of

368                  Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the
aqueous vapour correspond. This is the usual method of ex
pressing the action of a salt on the vapour-pressure of water—
that is, it raises the boiling-point so many degrees.
    It will be seen that the number of degrees that the boiling-
point of water is raised is a quantity that increases with the
temperature in all cases where the solubility also increases, but
diminishes in a more or less marked manner when the solu
bility decreases with the rise of temperature. All this can be
 readily explained. It is only to be expected that the larger
 number of molecules of salt present should have a greater
influence on the water-molecules ; but this explanation fails
 when the case of KN03 of the same strength is examined.
 Here the quantity of salt remained the same, and yet the
 increase of rise of boiling-point is very well marked. That
 the strength of the solution was the same at the end as at the
 beginning of the experiment was proved by weighing the tube
 before and after : the loss of water and salt adhering to the
 thermometer did not amount to "08 per cent. In this case,
 then, it appears that the restraining effect of the salt on the
 water increases with the rise of temperature.
    Before attempting to explain this, I wish to draw attention
 to a much more convenient mode of expressing the action of
salt on water with regard to its vapour-pressure. If at a tem
 perature t the vapour-pressure of water is pt, and at the same
 temperature the pressure of water-vapour from a salt-solution
is p't, then the pressure of pure water is diminished by the
 salt pt—p't millim. Now as the value of p increases faster
 than the temperature, in order to compare pt—p't with/??—
 we must divide by pt and pt! respectively, giving us
                     1_W and 1_ T$' *°"»
 numbers expressing the effect of the salt at those temperatures.
 If the salt-solution have the strength n molecules of salt to the
                                     p
 100 molecules of water, then —-— expresses the effect of each
 molecule of salt at that particular temperature.
    In Table III. are given the values of ^1 —        x 10,000 and
 the solubilities at the corresponding temperatures, with the
             I-*'
                 P
 values of —-— also multiplied by 10,000.        It is evident that

 solutions of constant composition the attraction of salt for
 water is increased with KN03, and diminished with FeS04 ;
 and this is also found with MnS04 at the temperatures 65°
 and 75°—so long as the solubility remains constant the value
          P'
 of 1 —        increases. Now KN03 has its solubility largely
 increased by rise of temperature, while that of FeS04 is
 diminished ; and we have seen above that when n = constant,
      P'
 1— p- increases in the case of KN03 and diminishes in the
 case of FeS04. The explanation of this apparently anomalous
 behaviour must lie in a change in the molecular relations in
 the solution. I have stated in previous papers that, from other
 experiments, I have come to the conclusion that the solubility
 of a salt is dependent on the attraction of salt for water and
 of salt for salt : if the former increases faster than the latter
 with the rise of temperature, then the salt is more soluble at
 a high temperature than at a lower, and vice versd. Now in

370                    Mr. W. W. J. Nicol on the
a strong solution the molecular volume of each salt-molecule
is greater than it is in a weak solution, owing to the attraction
of salt for salt having to a certain extent overcome the attrac
tion of salt for water. If, however, the solubility of the salt
increases with rise of temperature, then the effect of heat will
be to weaken to a great extent the attraction of salt for salt,
and to a small extent that of salt for water; but the diminution
in the attraction of salt for salt maybe so groat as to be practi
cally equal to an increase of the attraction of salt for water; and
such is the case with the solution of KN03 given above. On
the other hand, when solubility decreases with rise of tempe
rature, then the attraction of salt for water diminishes faster
than that of salt for salt ; and this is to be seen in the case of
 FeS04 above.
    Some experiments I have made on the coefficient of expan
 sion of concentrated solutions will make this even more clear.
 I experimented with NaCl, KC1, NaN03, and KN03 in nearly
 saturated solutions at 20°, and determined their density at
 20°, 40°, and 98° 0. The results and approximate strengths
 of the solutions are given in Table IV. ; and the volumes at

these temperatures (volume at 20° = 100,000) are compared
with the volume of water at the same temperature, that of
water being taken as follows:—
                         At 20° = 100,000,
                          „ 40° = 100,593,
                          „ 98° = 103,979.
Thus it is seen that, comparing the expansion between 20°
and 40°, or 20° with that between 40° and 98° or 58 degrees,
 that of water is about as 1 : fi, while in all the salt-solutions it
is less than 1:1; and in the case of KOI the volume at 98°
 is very considerably less than that of water, contraction having
 taken place between 40° and 98°. This has also been observed
 by Kremers, as I have shown in a previous paper*, and the
 table of molecular volumes at 20° and 40° that I have already
 published f also fully bears this out ; so that it is clear that,
 in a strong solution, the effect of rise of temperature is to
 cause an expansion which, as the temperature rises, becomes
  more and more similar to that of water alone, and after that
  actually is considerably less than it; so that at a high tempe
  rature the volume may be even less than that of water.
     Thus the experiments on the vapour-pressures of salt-
  solutions of constant strength, and on the coefficient of ex
  pansion of such solutions, show most plainly that, by rise of
  temperature, the attraction of salt for salt is so greatly dimi
  nished that it is equivalent to an increase in attraction of salt
  for water. That this is not the case with constantly saturated
  solutions is due to the attractions of salt for water and of salt
  for salt being in such solutions in equilibrium. Thus the effect
  of heat is, as usual, to diminish the attraction of salt for water,

      It is by a comparison of the values of —¦ P for various

  at the comparative value of the attraction of water for salt, the
   second factor in solution, while the ratios of the fraction F}

XXXIX. On a Method of Calculating the Constant y, expressing
   the Relation of the Specific Heat at Constant Pressure to the
   Specific Heat at Constant Volume. By W. Moon*.
LET Hi equal the specific heat of air at constant pressure,
       and H the specific heat at constant volume; then, when
a volume of air is compressed through dv, the adiabatic pres-
sure of the air will be 1+ i*5~5 times the isothermal
                              v      xi
pressure; and if this value is equated with the pressure cal
culated from the work required to produce the compression,
then the value of ^~ may be ascertained without experi
mentally knowing the value of H.
   The pressure may be thus calculated from the work required
to produce the compression:—
   If the temperature of a volume of air is increased from t
to ti (the volume being constant), then the pressure of the
air will be increased from 1 to \        PP3       : and therefore

if, while the volume of air is compressed from 1 to -, the tem
perature of the air varies from t to t\, then the pressure of the
air will be

 where /i=barometric height, and 1033*796 the pressure upon
 a square centimetre at 760 millim.
    The heat given off in the gas is equal to the work performed
 against the gas in compressing it divided by Joule's equi
 valent. Therefore, when the air is compressed through dv, the
 heat given off

                          42355
 To obtain from this expression the increase of temperature of
 the air, it must be divided by the specific heat at constant
 volume and the weight of a cubic centimetre of air,

By reducing, this equals

which equals the increase of temperature of the air resulting
from its compression ; and from this value the increase of pres

culated, since air tends to expand '003665 of its volume for
each increase of a degree Centigrade beyond zero.

XL. On Contrariants, a New Species of Invariants. By
   J. J. Sylvester, F.R.S., Saviiian Professor of Geometry in
   the University of Oxford* .
             " Non notationes sed notiones novae desunt."
ALL algebraists of the new school are familiar with the
        use of contrariants derived from and, so to say, sub
ordinate to, one or more primordial forms; but I am not aware
that, previous to my researches into the theory of the linear
equation in matrices, published in recent numbers of the
Comptes Rendus, any one has ever had occasion to consider
algebraical forms perfectly independent of, and given coordi-
nately as contravariantive to, one another. An invariant of
two such forms or systems of forms is called a Contrariant.
   It is no new circumstance in Mathematical History for a
general doctrine to take its rise in some process applied to a
particular investigation. It is a fact, but one not generally
known in this country, that the Cartesian method of coordi
nates originated in a happy idea which occurred to Descartes,
how to solve completely a geometrical problem bequeathed to
posterity by Pappus, apparently without any design on the
part of its immortal author to create a new geometrical cal
culus. So much is this the case, that some who have studied
that enigmatic treatise Descartes' Ge'ome'trie have come to
the conclusion that it was designed rather with the view of
applying geometry to algebra and obtaining graphical solu
tions of equations, than with that of reducing geometrical
analysis under the dominion of algebraical methods. With
the object of familiarizing my fellow workers with the novel
and (as the researches above alluded to demonstrate) im
portant conception, which at one stroke doubles the area of
invariantive theory and its geometrical applications, I propose
to consider the complete system of irreducible contrariants
to two quadratic forms with any number of variables.
   Another simple and interesting problem will be to show how
to transform simultaneously two contravariantive quadratics
(of course by contragredient substitutions) into one and the
same sum of powers of the substituted variables ; but this
must be reserved for some future occasion.
   The fundamental or irreducible invariants of two covarian-
tive quadratics, say f and <j>, of n variables we know are n + 1
in number (being the coefficients of the binary Quantic in \, /x,
obtained by supplying the same system of variables to the two
forms /and and then taking the discriminant of \f+ /*</>),

and will be of the deg . degs n, 0 ; n— 1, 1 ; n — 2, 2 ; . . .
1, (n— 1); 0, « respectively.
    I shall show that the same two forms, when treated as con-
travariantive, are also ft + 1 in number ; viz. two, as before,
of the deg . degs n, 0; 0, n; and the rest of the deg . degs 1, 1;
2,2; 3,3;... ; («-l), (n-1).
    The proof is instantaneous, or nearly so ; for by two con-
tragredient substitutions, / and <j) may be transformed into
aix* + OfX* + . . . + anx\ and klj* +      + . . . + k1?H (where the k is
employed in lieu of unity as a safeguard for maintaining
homogeneity in the subsequent operations). If, now,
                            d     d         d

in the second form, and this form so modified and its succes
sive powers be made to operate upon the first form and its
 corresponding powers, it is obvious that by combining the
 results of these operations, we may obtain the invariants
            2Aoi; SPa^;...; SA"-1 a, . a% . . . <i„_i;
 in addition to which we have the invariants of the two forms
 taken separately, viz. aj . aj . . . a„ and kn.
    These m + 1 invariants are, upon the face of them, mutually
 independent.
     But any invariant of the two forms must be symmetrical in
 regard to the a's, and consequently must be a symmetrical
 function of
              2,k?a1as; ... ; Xk"-'^ . a2 . . .       ; aj . a2 . . . a„,
 say F; or at all events of the form k±$ F, where 6 is an integer
 less than n ; but in such case k±e will be a rational (I do not
 say integral) invariant of the system, and therefore of the
 second form of the system, which we know has no other invariant
 than powers of k". Hence 0=1, and consequently there are no
  invariants other than the « + l independent ones above given.
  These, then, are the irreducible contrariants ; and it may be
 noticed that the sum of their deg . degs is —^— > —- — , the
  same, i. e., as the like sum for the irreducible invariants of
  the same two forms regarded as covariantive.
     An ordinary invariant might, in analogy with botanical
  language, be termed Invarians Vulgaris, or Simplex, or
  Eisensteinensis (from the name of the first discoverer of the
  species) ; and so a Contravariant, which necessarily belongs

376                      Geological Society :—
to two forms or two systems of forms, might be called Inva
riants Duplex, or Versicolor, or after the name of the person
who first imported the notion of contragredience into the
subject.
    A simple invariant may be likened to a monocotyledonous,
a contrariant to a dicotyledonous plant. And, again, an
assembly of forms containing a system of covariantive sets of
variables may be regarded as a monogamous, one containing
a system of sets partly covariantive and partly contravarian-
tive, as a digamous complex ; and in the latter case there will
be the further distinction into dioecious or monoecious ; for
the two kinds of systems of variables may be confined to sepa
rate forms, or appear together in the same mixed form, or they
may occur together in some of the forms and separate in the
others.
    In order to illustrate the position that such kind of analogies
are not purely fanciful, but have their origin in the Unity of
Nature, alike in its intellectual and its physical manifestations,
let me be allowed to recall the instance that I was led a priori
by a somewhat similar parallelism to anticipate a biological
possibility, which my distinguished colleague Prof. Martin,
of the Johns Hopkins University, was good enough to point
out to me is an actual fact in nature connected with Darwin's
theory of superfluous males. See " Constructive Theory of
Partitions," American Journal of Mathematics, vol. vi. foot

      1. "On the Pre-Cambrian Rocks of Pembrokeshire, with especial
reference to the St. David's District." By Dr. Henry Hicks, F.G.S.,
with an Appendix by Thomas Davies, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author, in this paper, gave further detailed evidence in addition
to that already submittod by him, to show that the Geological Survey
Map of tho district of St. David's and of othor parts of Pembrokeshire
is incorrect in some of its most essential features, and inaccurate in
very many of its petrographical and stratigraphical details. Some
new areas in South Pembrokeshire were also referred to. He

replied also to the criticisms contained in the paper by the Director-
General of the Survey, read last year before the Society, and indi
cated that Dr. Geikie had completely misunderstood the sections and
the order of succession of the rocks at St. David's. He pointed out
that the views so elaborately worked out by the Director-General,
to show the evidence of metamorphism in the rocks, were basod on
the entirely falso supposition that the granitoid rocks were intrusive
in the Cambrian rocks, and that the felsites were merely peripheral
masses. He showed, by producing abundant fragments of the gra
nitoid rocks and of tho folsites from the basal Cambrian conglo
merates, that the granitoid rocks were the very oldest rocks in the
district, and that they must undoubtedly be of Pre-Cambrian age.
He proved, from microscopical evidence, that the rocks supposed to
havo been altered by the intrusion of the granitoid rocks, were in
the condition in which they are now found before the Cambrian
rocks were deposited, and, moreover, that the supposed concretions
in the porcellanites and conglomerates, claimed to have been due
to metamorphism, had turned out, on microscopical evidence, to be
actually fragments of old Pre-Cambrian rhyolites enclosed in the
sediments. It was shown also that at the points indicated by the
Director-General, where the evidences of intrusion were supposed to
be seen, there was not the slightest change of a metamorphic cha
racter induced in tho sedimentary rocks in contact with the granitoid
rocks. The only difference that could possibly be recognized in them
by the aid of the microscope was such as is well known to be the
result of crushing when in the neighbourhood of faults. Indeed
there was the clearest evidence possible to show that the junctions
were merely fault junctions. The supposed fold in the Pebidian
rocks, the author stated, was impossible if penological evidence was
of any value. The author also produced many facts to show that
the conglomerates at the base of the Cambrian constantly over
lapped the different members of the series which he claimed to be
of Pre-Cambrian age, and that the unconformity was very marked
and to be clearly seen in many coast-sections. The conglomerates
were shown also to contain well-rolled pebbles of all the series in
cluded under the names Dimetian, Arvonian, and Pebidian, as proved
by careful microscopical examination of the fragments by Mr. T.
Davies and himself. An Appendix, by Mr. Davies, describing the
microscopic character of the rocks accompanied the paper.
   2. " Note on a specimen of Iron Amianthus." By the Rev. J.
Magens Mello, M.A., F.G.S.
   The accompanying specimen was found at the bottom of one of
the Wingeworth iron-furnaces, near Chesterfield, and was given to
me by Mr. Arthur Carrington, one of the owners.
   The furnaces have been lately blown out for repairs, and in the
mass of slaggy refuse at the bottom a thin layer of the curious pro
duct known as Iron Amianthus was interposed between the sand
and the iron refuse.
   The red sand at the bottom of the furnace was converted in its
upper part into a compact hard white sandstone, an inch or two in

thickness, and upon the top of this the Iron Amianthus occurred in
snow-white fibrous masses, the fibres radiating in a concentric
manner, and forming more or less botryoidal concretions, somewhat
resembling haematite in appearance, and separated by extremely
thin plates or septa of iron, by which the entire mass is divided into
irregular prisms of about half an inch in diameter.
   A similar product is described by Percy as occurring in the blasts
furnaces of the Harz, and is said to consist almost ontirely of fibrous
silica, with a few specks of iron and graphite, and minute cubes of
nitro-cyanide of titanium. Both graphite and titanium occur in
the Wingeworth refuse ; the graphite is found in thin plates, the
nitro-cyanide of titanium in masses of crystals.
   Percy states that the origin of the Iron Amianthus is found in
the oxidation of the silicon, which is separated in greater or less
degree under the same conditions as graphite, and is oxidized at a
high temperature.

   The following communications were read :—
   1. "The Archaean and Lower Paheozoic Eocks of Anglesey.'- By
Dr. C. Callaway, F.G.S. With an Appendix on some Rock-spe
cimens, by Prof. T. G. Bonney, D.Sc, F.R.S., President G.S.
   The object of the author was to furnish additional proof of the
Archaean age of the altered rocks of the island. He held that the
Pebidian mass on the north was fringed by Palaeozoic conglomerates,
containing, amongst other materials, large rounded masses of lime
stone, derived from the calcareous series on the north coast, these
conglomerates being probably a repetition by reflexed folding of
those which lie at the base of the Palaeozoic series. In like manner
conglomerates which margined the western (Holyhead) schistose area
contained angular pieces of altered slate undistinguishable from
some of the Pebidian rocks of the north-west. These conglomerates
dipped to the cast, forming the western side of a syncline. Near
Llanfihangel were sections which showed not only the Archaean ago
of the gneissic and slaty (Pebidian) groups, but also the highor
antiquity of the former. These conclusions were derived from the
occurrence of granitoid pebbles in the slaty series, and from the
presence of masses of the slate, as well as gneissic fragments, in
the basement Palaeozoic conglomerates. The author was at present
unable to accept the Cambrian age of tho lower Palaeozoic rocks,
and considered that the fossils he exhibited tended to confirm the
views of the Survey on the correlation of those strata. The paper
concluded with a sketch of the physical geography as it probably
existed in Ordovician times. An Appendix furnished by Prof.
Bonney tended, by microscopic evidence, to confirm the proof fur
nished by the paper.
   2. " On the new Railway-cutting at Guildford." By Lt.-Col. H.
H. Godwin-Austin, F.E.S., F.G.S., and W.Whitaker, Esq.,B.A., F.G.S.
   In this paper the authors described a section exposed in a new

            On the new B^ltmy-cutting at Ghiildford.              379
railway-cutting just north of Guildford station. The beds exposed
are Chalk and Eocene strata at the base, with overlying Pleistocene
or drift-beds. The Eocene beds appear at each end of the cutting,
the London Clay resting upon Woolwich and Reading beds as
described in 1850 by Prof. Prestwich ; and the interest of the sec
tion is due in part to this exposure of the Woolwich and Heading
beds, which are rarely seen in this neighbourhood, and in part >o
the thick mass of Pleistocene clays and gravels overlying the low er
Tertiary deposits. The latter appear to be only the remnanis of
more extensive deposits in the gorge of the Wey, which were spread
over the area to the north before the river had cut down to its
present level. Somo of them are in part of fluviatile origin and
composed of materials derived first from the Lower Greensand and
afterwards from the Chalk, ironstone predominating in the former
and flints in the latter. Resting unconformably upon these are
deposits consisting of irregularly bedded coarse loamy sands, beds of
large flints, with an admixture of fragments of chalk, and with
nests or large lumps of red clay. These are regarded as glacial
beds, and in the sands beyond the bridge at the London Road
remains of Mammalia {Elephas &c.) were found ; theBe sands are
exposed as far as Watford farm, where they terminate abruptly
against a steep bank of Woolwich and Reading beds. On digging
through them at this point the dark gravels with greensand iron
stone were met with.
    The authors pointed out that the most interesting questions con
 nected with these high-level gravels and sands of the ancient Wey
 are as follows :—1. What was their relation to the topography of
the country in the past ? 2. What relation do they bear to the
outlines of the country at the present day ? 3. What is their age ?
   They showed that when the gravels and sands were deposited
 the main drainage of the country was the same as it now is, though
the river was 60 feet above its present level. The sands with
mammalian bones were probably an accumulation in a re-entering
bend of the river, similar to one now existing a little further north.
The river appears at first to have been more rapid, when the lower
 ironstone gravels were deposited, then slower, when the sands accu
 mulated. Some change of levels ensued, and a considerable por
 tion of the deposits was removed before the upper strata of loam
 and flints were formed. It is probable that the gorge of the Wey
 was no longer an outlet to the north whilst these bods were being
 deposited. In general the loam and flint beds are horizontal,
 whilst in some localities they are displaced in a manner remarkably
 like what is seen in the glacial deposits of Alpine valleys. They
 contain land-shells in places. The land surface indicated by tho
 lower gravels and sands at Guildford is of older date than that
 described by Mr. R. A. C. Godwin-Austen in the country to the
 southward, and especially in the valley of the Tillingbourne.
   The deposits near Guildford belonging to the two epochs were
noticed in some detail. Both are pre-glacial and have been formed
when tho climate was temperate. The overlying glacial deposits
formed of chalk-detritus, flints, and loam are attributed to the

 North Devon." By Herbert Green Spearing, Esq. Communicated
 by Prof. Prestwich, M.A., F.R.S., V.P.G.S.
    The author stated that for the last nine years the sea has en
 croached near Westward Ho ! at the rate of about 80 foet annually.
 The encroachment affects only about a mile of the coast-line, but the
 sea has gradually worn away part of the Northern Burrows—a
sandy common forming the southern portion of the united delta of
the Taw and the Torridge, —and partially removed a broad ridge of
pebbles which formerly defended the coast-line, tho pebbles of
 which, derived from a raised beach, travel in a northerly direction
towards the mouth of the river. The sea tends to cut a way through
 the lower part of the Burrows, isolating part of the pebble ridge
 and forming a new mouth to the river. The inroads of the sea have
laid bare a submerged forest, composed chiefly of oak, birch, and
hazel, and containing bones of ox, sheep, deer, dog, pig, and goat,
with flint cores and chips, and shells of oysters, limpets, periwinkles,
&c. The woody layer, 18 or 20 inches thick, can bo traced for
400 yards to extreme low-water mark ; it rests on blue clay, which
is 4 feet thick under the pebble-ridge, but thins to seaward. It
contains cstuarine shells. Below it is a layer of rounded pebbles.
Near the mouth of tho river patches of shelly sandstone rest on the
clay, resembling that seen near Croydc, on the north side of the bay.
    In 1874 a pebble beach sloped to the sea from the frontage of the
building land at Westward Ho ! The pebbles have now disappeared,
and a cliff of clay, 15 feet high, occupies the spot. Near tho Ladies'
Baths this clay rests on rock of Carboniferous age, but nearer the
Burrows, to the northward, a layer of sand intervenes, and, being
easily washed away, facilitates the removal of the clay. To the
north and east the clay thickens and is mixed with pebbleB, many
of which are broken. This may be due to glacial action, but no
scattered stones have been observed. So long ago as 1600-1630
records of oncroachments exist.

   1. " The Range of the Palaeozoic Rocks beneath Northampton."'
By Henry John Eunson, Esq., F.G.S.
   The author referred to a shaft sunk at Kingsthorpe, near North

           On the Paleozoic Rocks beneath Northampton.             381
 ampton, in 1836, and also to a boring at the London and North-
Western Railway-Station about ten years later. At these spots the
beds beneath the Liassic series consisted of sandstones and marls,
and were considered to be of Triassic age.
    Palteozoic rocks were met with in two borings undertaken by
the Northampton Water Company, who attempted to reach the
Water-stones by piercing the upper beds of the Trias. The first
boring was situated between the sites of the two previous investiga
tions, on the Kettering road, near the town. The Upper, Middle, and
Lower Lias here attain a thickness of 738 feet, and below them a
series of conglomerates, sandstones, and marls rested upon an eroded
surface of a Carboniferous dolomite which passed into limestone
crowded with characteristic fossils. The beds above the dolomite
are not true Trias, but may represent local deposits of that age ;
46 feet of Carboniferous strata were drilled, and the boring was dis
continued at 851 feet.
    The second boring was at Gayton, five miles south-west of
Northampton. The Middle and Lower lias were 581 feet in thick
ness, and were succeeded by the White Lias and Rhsetio shales, the
latter containing the black shales and bone-bed. The Trias was
here discovered, but only 60 feet in thickness, the Water-stones
being absent. Then followed 20 feet of littoral beds containing
fragments of Carboniferous Limestone (from which more than 20
species of fossils were named by Mr. R. Etheridge, F.R.S.), resting,
at 699 feet, upon an eroded surface of Carboniferous Limestone,
 dipping at an angle of 45°, but in what direction was not ascer
tained. The beds between this point and 889 feet consisted of a
series of limestones and dark shales 79 feet, grey sandstones and
 grits 40 feet, red marls and sandstones 71 feet. The last fossils
 were observed at 889 feet. The boring was continued to a depth
 of 944 feet. The last 105 feet was composed of coarse red sand
 stones and marls with several bands of hard grits. These grits had
been examined microscopically by Prof. Bonney, whose notes were
 given. The above series may represent the Old Red Sandstone, or
may be only a local development of the lower beds of the Carboni
ferous ; however their materials have probably been derived from a
 mass of granitoid rocks belonging to some of the most ancient in
the Archaean series. Saline water was met with in both borings.
    A description was also given of an unsuccessful boring for coal
at Orton, near Kettering. Beneath the Lias clays, 666 feet in thick
ness, the White Lias and Rhoetic were discovered, followed by a sand
stone and breccia resting upon an eroded surface of a quartz-felsite
at 715 feet. The boring was discontinued at a depth of 789 feet in
this rock. The quartz-felsite had been examined by Prof. Bonney,
who expressed an opinion thsit it was similar to rocks of the volcanic
group of Charnwood Forest, 25 miles to the north-east. The old
land surface had thus been proved at the three borings, at Gayton
dipping rapidly, and probably being the edge of a syncline, in which
coal may yet be discovered to the south or south-west, beneath the
overlying Mesozoic formations.

     According to Mr. Mallet, the amount of heat lost from the initial
 temperature of the earth will represent the force of its contraction.
 To this force he attributes the inclination and crumpling of strata,
 together with all volcanic phenomena. He states that the calcula
 tions of Elic de Beaumont, Forbes, and Sir William Thomson, 0-0065,
 0-007, and 0-0085 miHim. respectively, represent the thickness of a
 plate of ice covering the earth, which, melted, would equal the heat
 lost annually. From these data he calculates that from 575 to
 777 cubic miles of ice, melted, would represent the loss of heat.
 This calculation was shown to be entirely in error. According
 to the data an amount of energy represented by the melting of
 from -7937 to 1-0387 cubic mile of ice only would be dissipated,
  or about a 700th part of the amount estimated by Mr. Mallet.

  London." By Prof. John W. Judd, F.R.S., Sec. G.8.
      Since tho reading of the former papor on the subject (February 6,
  1884), the well-boring at Richmond has been carried to a depth
  of more than 1300 feet. The point reaehed is, reckoning from
  Ordnance-datum line, 220 feet lower than that attained by any
  other boring in the London basin.
      A temporary cessation of the work has permitted Mr. Collett
  Homersham to make a more exact determination of the underground
  temperature at Richmond. At a depth of 1337 feet from the sur
  face, this was found to bo 75^° F., corresponding to a rise of tem

       The Rev. H. H. AVinwood, of Bath, has had the good fortune to
   find the original fossils obtained by the late Mr. C. Moore from
   the oolitic limestone in the boring at Meux's Brewery in 1878. A
   careful study of these proves that though less numerous and in a
   far less perfect state of preservation than the fossils from the Rich
   mond well, they in many cases belong to the same species, and
   demonstrate the Great Oolite age of the strata in which they
  occurred.

Austen, F.R.S., F.G.S.
   In a visit to some of the moraines on the south side of the Alps,
the author's attoution was drawn to certain Tertiary beds under
lying the glacial deposits at Ivrea, and near the Lago d'Orta at
Boca, Maggiora, and especially at Buccione, south of Orta, and
close to the southern extremity of the lake. Here there is a small
remnant of micaceous sands containing older Pliocene marine fossils.
The species have been determined by Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys, and a list
was appended to the paper. The patch of Pliocene beds has appa
rently been protected by the porphyritic mass on which the old tower
of Buccione stands ; the remainder of the Tertiary strata, which for
merly must have extended northward to the Soce Valley, have been
swept away by the ice of the glacial period.
   The deposits at Boca and Maggiora were also described in some
detail. Thoy are probably newer Pliocene.
   Near Ivrea the most interesting section seen was at Strambinello,
on the banks of the Chiusella. Here on both banks of the stream
horizontal Pliocene beds, containing marine shells, are exposed rest
ing on diorito. On the south bank the Pliocene is broken up and
mixed with diorito fragments. Moraine overlies the Pliocene.
The great Dora Baltea glacier swept across tho gorgo of the Chiu
sella, and only left a remnant of the marine beds where protected
by the ravine.
   The Pliocene sea probably extended along the south base of the
Alps, extending in long gulfs up the valleys, out of which the
marine deposits have been swept by tbe ice, except in a few pro
tected spots.
   The paper concluded with a notice of some f'ossiliferous gritty
marl seen in a ravine close to Dormiletto on Lago Maggiore. Al
though probably in situ, the mass was not sufficiently exposed to show
its relations to the surrounding rocks.
   8. " On the Geological Position of the Weka-Pass Stone." By
Capt. F. W. Hutton, F.G.S.
   The beds described in this paper are of older Tertiary and newer
Secondary age, and occur in the northern part of Ashley county, in

384                     Geological Society :—
the province of Canterbury, between the Hurunui and Waipara
rivers. All of the beds are met with at Weka Pass, on the railway
and road between Christchurch and Nelson, and the following is the
section in descending order : —
   1. Mount-Brown beds ; pale yellowish sandstone with bands of
        shells and coral limestone, considered by all New Zealand
        geologists Upper Eocene or Oligocene.
   2. Grey sandy marl.
   3. Weka-pass stone, yellowish with arenaceous limestone, usually
        with small green grains.
   4. Amori limestone, white, flaggy, and argillaceous.
   5. Green sandstone with remains of marine saurians.
   The last rosts conformably on beds of coal and shale, with leaves
of dicotyledonous angiosperms, forming the base of the Waipara
system. To this system Nos. 4 and 5 of the above section have also
been referred by Dr. von Haast and the writer. The upper beds are
the Oamara system of the samo authors. The question to be decided
is the limit between the two. The green sandstone (No. 5), and the
coal shales, are generally admitted to be Cretaceous.
   The geographical distribution of the beds enumerated was briefly
described, the groy sandy marl (No. 2), the Amori limestone (No. 4),
and the green sandstone having a northerly extension to Cook's
Straits, whilst the other beds have been traced to the south only.
An examination of the stratigraphical evidence shows that at
Weka Pass, and also on the Waipara, the Weka-pass stone rests on
a waterworn surface of the Amori limestone, and near the Pass the
former overlaps the latter. The grey marl (No. 2) is evidently
unconformable to the lower beds of the Waipara system, whilst at
Waipara and Weka Pass it passes down conformably into the Weka-
pass stone. The grey marl also passes up conformably into the
Mount-Brown beds. The author concludes that the break in suc
cession is between the Weka-pass stone and the Amori limestone.
   The geological evidence is in accordance with the pateontological
data. The fossils hitherto found in the Weka-pass stone ( Foluta
elongata, Scalaria rotunda, Struthiolaria senex, Pccten Hochstetteri,
Meoma Crawfurdi, Schizaster rotundatus, and Flabellum circulare)
are found in other parts of New Zealand in Upper Eocene beds.
None of them are known from the Cretaceous Waipara system.
The fossils from the grey marl are also in some cases identical with
those found in the Mount-Brown beds.
   The author concluded by giving reasons for not agreeing with
Dr. Hector, who classes all the beds mentioned as belonging to one
system of Cretaceo-Tertiary age.
   9. " On the Chemical and Microscopical Characters of the Whin
Sill." By J. J. H. Teall, Esq., F.G.S.
   The Whin Sill is an intrusive sheet of basic igneous rock which
occurs in the Lower Carboniferous strata of the north of England.
It is remarkably uniform in character, the prinoipal varieties
evidently depending merely on the conditions of consolidation.

               Geology and Mineralogy of'Madagascar.                385
Close to the junctions the rock is compact ; the dominant variety,
however, is of a grey or hluish-grey colour and medium grain.
Irregular masses of a very coarse variety, characterized by long flat
prisms of pyroxene measuring an inch or more in length, occur here
and there in the dominant medium-grained rock.
    The principal constituents of the rock of the Whin Sill are plagio-
clase felspar, a pyroxene having certain special characters, and a
magnetic titaniferous iron-oxide. Apatite is invariably present in
very small quantity. Interstitial matter may generally be recognized,
also in very small quantity ; in the coarser varieties this interstitial
matter takes the form of micropegmatite. The accessory consti
tuents are a rhombic pyroxene (bronzite), hornblende, biotite,
pyrite, and various green decomposition-products. Olivine has not
been detected by the author, oither as a fresh mineral or in the con
dition of a pseudomorph. The three principal constituents have
been isolated by means of the Sonstadt solution and a weak bar-
magnet, and separate analyses are given in the paper. The felspar,
if of one species, must be allied to andesine ; the opaque iron-ore is
strongly magnetic, and contains 33 per cent, of titanic acid. The
prevailing pyroxene develops a laminated structure, parallel to the
 basal plane, by alteration. In composition it deviates in the most
 marked manner from the rule laid down by Tschermak, Mg+Fe
 being greater than Ca. Bulk-analyses of two specimens of the
 Whin Sill were given, and one of these was calculated out by means
 of the data supplied by the separate analyses of the three principal
 constituents.
    The rock presents many points of resemblance to the continental
 diabases. It comes nearest to certain Swedish diabases described
 by Tornebohm and to the great masses of trap which occur in the
 Mesozoic strata of the Atlantic border of North America.

 Dr. G. W. Parker. Communicated by F. W. Eudler, Esq., F.G.S.
     This paper commenced with a sketch of tho physical geography of
 the island of Madagascar. A central plateau from 4000 to 5000 feet
 high occupies about half the island, rising above the lowlands that
 skirt the coasts, and from this plateau rise in turn a number of
 volcanic cones, the highest, Ankaratra, being 8950 feet above the
 sea. With the exception of certain legends, there is no record of a
 period when the volcanoes were active : two such legends were given.
     The known volcanic cones wore enumerated. They extend from

386            Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
the northern extremity of the island to the 20th parallel of south
latitude. Boyond this granite and other primitive rocks occur as
far as lat. 22°, south of which the central parts of Madagascar are
practically unknown to Europeans.
    Some crater-lakes and numerous hot and mineral springs occur.
    Earthquakes are occasionally felt in the island, most frequently
in the months of September and October. The shocks are generally
slight.
    Only a single trap-dyke is known near Antananarivo. The hills
around this city are of varieties of granite (? granitoid gneiss). The
general direction of the strata is parallel to the long axis of the
island.
    Marine fossils have been found by Eev. J. Richardson and Mons.
 Grandidier in the south-west part of the central plateau. These
 fossils are referred by the last-named traveller to the Jurassic
 system. Remains of Hippopotami, gigantic Tortoises, and an extinct
 Ostrich-like bird have also been recorded. North and north-west
 of the fossilifcrous rocks, between them and the volcanic district of
 Ankaratra, sandstone and slate occur. North of this volcanic
 district again is a tract of country in which silver-lead (mixed with
zinc) and copper are found.
    Near the north-western edge of the central plateau are granitic
 escarpments facing northwards and about 500 feet high. Some
 details were also given of valleys through the central plateau and of
 lagoons within the coral reefs on the coasts. To these remarks
 succeeded some details of the physical features exhibited by the
 province of lmerina as seen from Antananarivo.

    THE INFRA-RED EMISSION-SPECTRA OF METALLIC VAPOURS.
                            BY H. BECQUEREL.
    AST year I submitted to the Acadeinie des Sciences a short
      account of my first researches on the infra-red spectra emitted
by metallic vapours, till then unknown *. Since that time 1 have
investigated the subject still further by making use of a special
spectroscope, which shall be described in a future paper ; I will
simply mention here, that the method consists in throwing the
 spectra, about to be examined, upon a suitable phosphorescent
 substance, which has been previously rendered luminous, and in
observing the temporary excitation, w hich precedes extinction, under
 the influence of the infra-red rays. The lines and bands of the
emission-spectra then appear brilliant, and can be examined with
the microscope.
    In experimenting on different phosphorescent substances, notably
                    * Comptee Meruius, t. xcvii. p. 71.

                Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.              387
certain preparations of sulphide of calcium, I found some much
more sensitive than others for infra-red rays. These substances
have permitted me to determine directly the wave-lengths for
the more brilliant lines of several incandescent metallic vapours
(potassium, sodium, cadmium), by using the diffraction-spectra pro
duced by a very beautiful metal grating of Mr. Rutherfurd's, which
was kindly lent me by M. Mascart.
    For other metals, the spectra were obtained by means of a bi-
sulphide-of-carbon prism. The positions of the lines were referred
to those of the potassium and sodium lines, and to the positions
 of the bands and characteristic lines in the infra-red region of
 the solar spectrum, as well as the absorption-bands of samarium ;
 the wave-length for each line was then determined by interpolation
 with great accuracy.
    The wave-lengths for the lines and principal bands in the infra
 red of the solar spectrum have been again determined by means of
 the grating, which had been placed at my service ; and the more
 sensitive substances in my possession have permitted me to extend
 these measurements much further than I was enabled to do in my
 previous researches *. 1 propose to return shortly to this work,
 which has led me to rectify several numbers relating to wave
 lengths at the less- refrangible end of the spectrum ; I will only
 give here the wave-lengths of the principal lines used for reference :
 the band indicated by A" in my former memoir is made up of
 two bands, whose wave-lengths are from O00115 to 0-00119
 millim., and from 0-001132 to 0-001142 millim.; the large band
 A'" extends from 0-001351 to about 0-001400 millim., and the
 extreme band A'v from 0-001800 to about 0-001900 millim. The
 wave-lengths of the characteristic absorption-bands of samarium,
 directly determined, are : from 0-001079 to 0-001097 millim. for
 the first, and from 0-001239 to 0-001267 for the second.
     The metals were volatilized in the voltaic arc. The intensity
  was such, that I could make use of a very narrow slit, and
  observe, on the phosphorescent substance, interesting details. In
  this case, it is necessary that the image of the line be brought to
  an exact focus on the phosphorescent screen ; for, unless this be
  so, the results are not observable when the slit is narrow. I have
  not as yet been able to invent a suitable arrangement for giving
  a complete and definite image of the whole of the infra-red spectrum;
  but, by repeated trials, it was possible to obtain sufficiently distinct
  images of the groups of lines which are to be examined. 1 am
  occupied, however, at the present moment with an improvement,
  which will admit of still greater delicacy.
     The following table contains the wave-lengths for the most
  intense lines, bands, or groups of lines which characterize the
  spectra of several metallic vapours. The numbers are expressed in
  millionths of a millimetre, and are generally exact to one or two
  millionths of a millimetre.

   Nickel gave several rather feeble bands or groups of lines ;
whilst iron, in our experiments, gave no band sufficiently intense
to examine.
   The results, indicated above, show how rich the field of research
is which the phenomena of phosphorescence open up in the in
visible part of the infra-red of the spectrum, and which, alone,
covers an interval of wave-lengths greater than the visible and
ultra-violet parts together.
   Besides the interest it may excite by proving the existence of
these rays, of which the wave-lengths are considerable, in the
spectra of metallic vapours, this research, more than any other, is
of the kind to give most valuable information concerning the un
known laws which govern the vibratory motion of incandescent
vapours.— Comptes Bendus, August 25, 1884.
    CHANGE IN THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF BISMUTH WHEN
          PLACED IN A MAGNETIC FIELD. BY M. HURION.
    Recent experiments of M. Ledru (Journal de Physique, ^ serie,
vol. iii. p. 133), which may be easily repeated, show that if a plate
of bismuth is placed in a magnetic field and at right angles to the
lines of magnetic force, the equipotential surfaces of a current
traversing the plate are deflected from their proper direction, from
 which it follows that the physical constitution of the metal is
 altered. This alteration may be revealed by other effects, especially
 by the action of polarized light.
    Dr. Kerr's researches (Phil. Mag. May 1877) have shown that a
 mirror placed between the poles of an electromagnet rotates the
 plane of polarization of an incident perpendicular ray through a
 certain angle when the electromagnet is excited ; the rotation is in
 the opposite direction of the current which produces the magneti
 zation. Bismuth has similar properties, as follows from the
 following experiments.
    A mirror is prepared whose reflecting surface is produced by
 running out the melted metal on a plate of glass heated, as done
 by M. Bighi (Journal de Physique, 2e serie, vol. iii. p. 127) : the
 glass plate with a thin layer of metal is placed between the poles
 of a Faraday's electromagnet. The armatures of the electromagnet
 have a perforation in the centre ; one of them is flat and the other
 conical, and the light comes through the aperture in the latter.
 The ray reflected at right angles returns in its original direction,
 and meets under an angle of 45° an uncoated glass which allows
 the direct light to pass, and directs the reflected ray sideways.
 The incident light traverses the polarizing system of a Laurent's
 saccharimeter, and the reflected light is received in an analyzer of
 the same material. The electromagnet may be traversed first in
 one direction and then in another by the current of a Gramme
 machine of the workshop type.
    It is observed that the plane of polarization of the reflected ray
 is deflected by about 30' when the direction of the current is
 reversed ; the rotation is in the same direction as the current which

390          Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.
produces the magnetization. It is clear that the effect observed is
in part due to the action of the glass plate.
   To allow for this latter action the bismuth may be removed from
a small portion of the glass plate, and placing the analyzer at the
other end of the apparatus we may examine the transmitted ray.
It is found that the plane of polarization of the light which has
passed through the glass turns through 24' when the direction of
the current is changed ; the rotation, as is known, is in the direction
of the current. But in the first experiment the glass plate, having
been twice traversed by light, should have produced a rotation of
48' ; observation gave 30'. We should conclude from this that
bismuth has turned the plane of polarization through 18' in the
opposite direction of the current which excites the electromagnet.
We may compare this result with the effect produced by a steel
mirror placed under the same conditions ; experiment shows a
rotation of 22' in the opposite direction of the current which excites
the electromagnet.
   If we cover again the steel mirror of the plate which carried
the bismuth mirror, we observe a rotation of 28' in the direction of
the current, from which we may conclude that we shall have the
special effect of the glass plate by adding to this rotation that pro-
dueed-directly by the steel, which gives for the effect of the plate
50' instead of 48'. the number found above ; the verification is
therefore satisfactory. Experiments at present being made have
shown me that the electrical resistance of bismuth increases when
it is placed in a magnetic field.—Journal de Physique, August 1884.
          ON THE DISTANCE OF THE POLES OF MAGNETS.
               BY W. HALLOCK AND F. KOHLRAUSCH.
    Most measurements of bar-magnets, of terrestrial magnetism,
and galvanism, in so far as the distribution of the magnetism in a
bar conies into account, may be arranged in such a way that, for
ordinary purposes, we need go no further than for the knowledge
of the position of the " poles." By this we understand here those
points in which, in actions at a distance, we may assume the free
magnetism, provided that the fourth power of the ratio of the length
of the magnet to the distance from the magnet vanishes in compa
rison with unity. Ordinary long magnets have this property.
    The distance of these poles from each other usually occur in
corrections, which are sufficiently near if the polar distance is
known to within a few percents. The question how far this is
given by the form of the magnet plays an important part in elec
trical and magnetic measurements, for it influences their simplicity
and, under some circumstances, even their accuracy.
    One of us some time ago had endeavoured, by measurements
 with the tangent-galvanometer made in the Physical Institute in
Gottingeu, to determine the distance of the poles, and in connexion
with these experiments had caused M. Schueebeli* to make some

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.            391
observations on bars and on needles by this method and by the
method of deflections. The results of these experiments exhibited
a suprising agreement among the various magnets, although the
number of experiments was not so great as to exclude an accident.
   We have therefore made a larger series of experiments of this
kind, the provisional results of which are here given.
   In these experiments we used : —
   (1) The deflection of a short needle by the magnet to be examined
in the ordinary way.
   (2) The simultaneous action of the magnet on two magnetome
ters, between which the bar was placed, from two different positions.
This process is one of great accuracy, since the alterations in tem
perature of the bar are without influence, and since the variations
in the vertical component of the earth's magnetism completely, and
the horizontal at any rate partially, disappear.
   (3) The simultaneous action of currents in concentric circles of
different diameters on the needle to be investigated. If the dia
meter of the coils is inversely as their number in each case, this
method may be made in a form which even exceeds in simplicity
and accuracy the preceding ; and is quite independent of external
disturbance.
   The factor with which the external length of the magnet must
be multiplied in order to obtain the distance of the poles, that is
to say the ratio of the ideal or reduced to the actual length, may
be briefly called the modulus of the polar distance, and may be
denoted in the following by k.
    Fourteen magnets were used, some of them in various conditions
of hardness. Where nothing else is said, they are cylinders mag
netized in the direction of the axis.
    1. Six recently prepared small round bars of the hardness of glass,
 50 centim. in length, 40 centhn. in thickness, and 5 grammes in
 w eight, some magnetized to saturation, and some intentionally only
 partially magnetized, so that the specific magnetism was between 6
 and 24 C. G. units for 1 gramme of steel, gave the modulus
                            k = 0S2 to 0-86.
    (After tempering in the lead-bath, the numbers increased, in
 some cases partly to 0-90.)
    2. Two larger, externally equal magnets, which had long been in
 use, and had been frequently magnetized, 780 grammes in weight,
 dimensions 44 x 2*3 x I/O centim. and with the specific magnetism
 39, gave the values
                           £=0-82 and 0-83.
     3. A hard hollow cylinder, 15 centim. long, of 1-6 centim. ex
 ternal diameter, weighing 109 grammes, and with the specific mag
 netism 32, and which had been treated by Strouhal's method, having
 been boiled during 30 hours since magnetizing, gave
                                 *=0-85.
     4. A hard, massive steel cylinder recently hardened and mag
  netized, lti centim. long, 1*48 centim. thick, and of the specific

magnetism 26, bad
                                   *=0-81.
    5. Finally, two bars of the same hard steel, 1'03 centim. thick,
30 and 20 centim. in length, and weighing 200 and 133 grammes
respectively, the corresponding magnetizations being 42 and 28,
gave
                                   *=0-82.
    If we compare with these twelve bars, which together gave
numbers between 0-81 and 0*86, the values previously found by
Schneebeli for two bars, 0*84 and 0-86, together with the numbers
observed by me for two magnetic needles, and, finally, the values
recently given by von Hehnholtz *, 0-84 and 0-86 ; if, further, we
consider the comparatively great difficulties and sources of error of
such measurements, without which the differences would be still
less, we may maintain with some certainty that the value
                             >fc = 0-83, or 5/6
is very near for ordinary long magnets. In other words,
    The effective poles of a magnet are about -fe of the distance from
tJie etuis.
    On this assumption, we need never fear any errors amounting
to 5 per cent, of the length ; and hence in many magnetic measure
ments there is no necessity for a separate determination of the
distance of the poles.
    Eieckehas observed t that that distribution of the magnetism in
a bar which had resulted from the experiments of Van liees leads
to a modulus of the polar distance of a similar magnitude to the
above.
    From their importance as magnetic needles, especially in galva
nometers, we have examined a circular magnet and a ring-magnet,
and, as observed above, by the simultaneous action of circular cur
rents of the same diameter. Calling d the external diameter of
the disk or of the ring, we found that in the factor of reduction of
the tangent-compass which contained the member 3/16 Ayfi2, A is
to be introduced as the " length of the needle."
    For the circular disk (diameter =2-2 centim., thickness 0*17
centim., mass =4-6 grammes, and specific magnetism =7),
                                 \=0-80rf;
and for the ring (external diameter 2*3 centim., internal diameter
1*9 centim., thickness =0-22 centim., mass =2 grammes, specific
magnetism =14),
                                  A=0-88d.
    Until a sufficiently large number of round magnets shall have
been investigated, these numbers may afford at any rate an
approximation.—Wiedemann's Annalen, No. 7, 1884.

             XLIII. On the Numerics of the Elements.
              By Edmund J. Mills, D.Sc, F.R.S."
I EMPLOY Professor James Thomson's expression "nu
       meric " as an abbreviation of " numerical value." The
numeric of an element is the numerical value ascribed to its
symbol.
    Ever since Dobereiner's timef the relations between the
numerics of the elements have been felt to bo a fascinating
study; but it was not until the discovery by NewlandsJ of
the periodic function, that a closer and really comprehensive
grasp of the subject was rendered possible. The theory of
the periodicity of compounds was subsequently developed by
myself §, under the name of" Cumulative Resolution."
    It has of late years been admitted that it would be desirable
to place the periodicity of the elements on a more definite
numerical basis, and to include in it, if possible, a much
closer approximation to actual numerics than it has hitherto
contained. Accordingly, in 1879, I drew up a list of mean
values of the numerics of the elements ; there was but little
difficulty in finding that these constituted a succession of
geometric series. At this point the work was laid aside for
further consideration. The appearance, in 1882, of Clarke's
able and exhaustive summary of all the evidence relating to

to Professor Ferguson.

Spon, 1884).

of boiling-point and melting-point, see Phil. Mag. [5] xvii. p. 173.

394                Dr. Edmund J. Mills on the
tho numerics, and of a treatise by Meyer and Seubert upon
the same subject in 1883, placed ampler data in my hands.
These have enabled mo to calculate with considerable accuracy
 the three constants required by the consecutive equations.
    If approximate trials be made with sets of contiguous
 numerics, it will soon become evident that every numeric is
of the form
 K being some integral multiple of a number near to 15,
 B being also near to 15, /3 the geometric factor, and x the
ordinal in the series. If K bo taken as once, twice, thrice,
&c. 15, we shall have a succession of groups of numerics, and,
putting K=pl5, p will indicate their period. Lastly, we
can calculate the largest value of /3 which we may use in
common for all the groups, so as to make them interdependent:
this number will obviously be more accurately determined
than the other constants. The mean result from 37 numerics,
distributed in 9 groups, has been found to be /3 = "93727; for
this, without sensible error, we may write /3 = ,9375 = 15/16.
It is probable that the equation
                       ?/=pl5-15(-9375)*
includes tho numerics of all known elements excepting
hydrogen.

            On the Specific Values of some Numerics.
   Nitrogen.—The details of Stas' recent work have not yet
reached me. His latest result is 14*053.
   Magnesium.—If we reject Dumas' determination (Clarke,
p. 107), the mean of the older results is 24-19. The mean of
this and Marignac's (1884), Mg = 24-37, has heen accepted.
   Potassium.—Stas' new result is stated as 39-142.
   Manganese.—The best of the older work, in my opinion, is
that of Berzelius and Turner : mean 54-86. Marignac (1884)
gives 55*07. The mean of these numbers has been accepted.
Dewar and Scott (1883) obtained 55-04.
   Chromium.— Baubigny (1884) finds a still nearer value,
viz. 52*16.
   Nickel and Cobalt.—In spite of the very great labour
already expended on these numerics, they still remain open
to question. I have given Clarke's averages, which have, as
will be observed, a place in the theory.
   Copper.—Ever since the publication of Wright and Menke's
"Notes on Manganese Dioxide" [Chem. Soc. J. (trans.)
1880, p. 22], I have felt grave doubts as to the exactness of
the composition of higher oxides. The numeric of copper
has been decided by several series of analyses of the higher
oxide, confirmed by electrolysis of the sulphate. Both of

398                Dr. Edmund J. Mills on the
these methods might well lead to too high a result. A
numeric founded on analyses of cuprous chloride or bromide
would be much more satisfactory, and might not improbably
correspond to #=3.
   Zinc.—Marignac (1884), using a method of obviously
approximate character, gives Zn = 65"31.
    Yttrium.—Cleve s numeric (1882) has been taken.
    Tellurium.—Wills's best result [Chem. Soc. Journ. (trans.)
1879, p. 704] agrees, as will be noticed, closely with calcu
lation.
   Lanthanum, Cerium, and Didymium.—Here I have followed
Brauner (1883), who determined the relation between oxide
and sulphate. Robinson (1884), who determined the chlorine
in cerous chloride, makes Ce=139"90. If, in this group,
x = G, y = 139"82. Further experiment is necessary to decide
this numeric.
    Samarium.—Brauner (1883).
    Ytterbium.—Nilson (1880).
    Norwegium.— Dah11 (1879).
    Thorium.—Nilson (1883).
    Uranium.— Peligot (1846).
                    Remarks and Inferences.
    A comparison of the theoretical with the experimental
 numerics shows an extremely close agreement between them.
 Such a comparison is most rigorous when it is made for the
 best known numerics, and for low values of x ; here the error
 (if it be indeed all error) does not exceed a moderate amount
 in the second decimal place.
    The numerics of the elements have not all been determined
 in the same way—as, for example, by estimation of chlorine
 in the chlorides ; and, though different methods of obtaining
 the same numeric lead generally to nearly the same result,
 they seldom involve exactly the same result. Thus our existing
 records do not enable us to say that the weight of Na that
 combines with the weight of CI is precisely identical with the
 weight that combines with Br ; nor does it necessarily follow
 that any single method of determination is in effect the same
 thing for all numerics. It is, in short, open to any theorist
 to express a given " definite proportion " in the form a + md ;
 a being the invariable definite proportion as at present con
 ceived, d the vapour-density of a varied element combining with
 a constant element, and m a small factor to be calculated from
 the experimental data. Hence the "error" of the geometrical
 theory, small though it is, is not necessarily all error ; and it

                     Numerics of the Elements.                399
opens up an entirely new field for chemical calculators. Our
only existing resource is an average, in each particular case,
of all unobjectionable results. In the present memoir these
averages have been further subjected to geometrical average ;
each one thus connecting the other by a method far more
severe than that of arithmetical means.
   As regards the very interesting and perennial discussion of
Prout's law, it is clear that the numerics which I have calcu
lated are completely opposed to a theory of whole numbers,
or integral multiples, for the great majority of the elements.
Such a law can only hold in the few cases where x=0 or oc ;
and As, Sb, and U appear to be the only instances of it.
    If we consider the expression for any numeric,
                    y=p.l5-15(-9375)x,
we shall observe that, while the periodic factor continues to
increase, the geometric portion of the equation undergoes no
change. If p grew very large, a time would arrive when
 — lb('S'd75)x would cease to materially affect the value of p 15.
It is therefore easy to conceive the existence of an upper
limit to our existing system of numerics ; indeed, in the
natural order of events, such a limit might occur without
making p very large.
    Chemists can hardly fail to be struck with the fact that
U = 240 has for eighWnd-thirty years of vigorous scientific
research remained the highest value on their list. Another
very interesting and tempting suggestion is latent in the
series 15("9375)x itself. The sum of all its terms between
0 and cc is exactly 240 ; in other words, this number repre
sents the total formative change in any given group. Hence
 240 can hardly fail to bo a critical number in, and may very
probably be the upper limit of, our existing system.
    If we accept this suggestion, the general equation for
numerics assumes the following very simple character—
ii + l being the number of groups in the system. Hydrogen,
which all systematists agree in excluding from the common
system, may from the new point of view be regarded as a
relic of earlier changes embodied in the equation
                        ^Ixl-l^J.
This system would contain only two groups, of the first of
which hydrogen would be the terminal member.

   XLIV. On Laplace's Equation. By JoHK H. Jellett,
            D.D., Provost of Trinity College, Dublin*.
THE equation upon which Laplace founded his discussion
       of the problem of attraction has excited, as is well known,
a large amount of controversy. No doubt, indeed, appears to
exist as to the truth of this equation in the case to which alone
Laplace has applied it, nor therefore as to the validity of the
method which he has built upon this foundation. But Laplace
professes to demonstrate the truth of his equation for a case
more general than that which he subsequently considers; and
it is in this more general form that its truth has been ques
tioned. My object in the present paper is to endeavour to
determine exactly the limits within which Laplace's equation
is true, as it appears to me that these limits are somewhat
wider than has been generally supposed f.
   I proceed, in the first place, to give a proof of this equation
agreeing substantially with that given by Laplace, and then to
consider what conditions or limitations, if any, are necessary to
the validity of this proof. Laplace's equation isas follows:—
   Suppose the force of attraction to vary as the nth power of
the distance. Let V be the potential of the attraction of a
nearly spherical body on a point upon its surface. Let V, be
the potential (at the same point) of a sphere, touching the sur
face at the point in question, and separated from it throughout
by a small distance, which we may denote by ecu, a. being a
small constant quantity, and u a function of the polar angles
0, <f>. Let A, A! be the attractions, resolved along the common
normal, of the original solid and the sphere respectively. Let
also b be the radius of the sphere. Laplace's equation is
(Met: Cel. Livr. 3, chap. ii. sect. 10),
                       V=V1+^I(A-A1)                                 (1)
   This equation may be put under a form somewhat simpler,
and which will enable us to mark more distinctly the limits
within which it is true. Let v be the potential, at the point
of contact, of the shell included between the original surface
and the sphere. Let also a be its normal attraction at the
same point. Then
                     r = V — V„ « = A— Aj,

and the equation becomes
                        (n + l)v = 2ba;                        (2)
or, as it may be otherwise written,

where r is the distance from the centre of the sphere of a
point situated on the radius through the point of contact.
   To prove this, Laplace assumes in the first place that the
thin shell lying between the sphere and the original surface
may be replaced by a " distribution " of matter (to use Gauss's
expression) on the spherical surface itself. This assumption
is only approximately true, inasmuch as it neglects the differ
ences of distance among the particles situated on the same
radius vector. The degree of the approximation will be con
sidered further on.
   Let P be the point of contact, and Q any other point on
the surface of the sphere. Taking the origin, 0, at the centre
of the sphere, put P 0 Q = 6, PQ=p, and let e be the density
of the distribution at the point Q. Then evidently

Hence (n + \)v=2ba; and Laplace's equation is proved, if the
foregoing integration be legitimate. It is of course only ap
proximately true, the degree of approximation being the same
as that of the assumption made in the beginning, namely that
a distribution on the spherical surface may be substituted for
the thin shell.
   We have then to inquire, in the first place, what conditions
are necessary to the validity of the integration indicated in (4)
and (5), and, secondly, to what degree of approximation is the
result true.
   In reply to the first question, it may be said that it is suffi
cient to ensure the validity of the process of integration that
the function to be integrated remain finite within the limits
of integration. Thus, if the integral be JJ U dd d<b, it is

402            Dr. J. H. Jellett on Laplace's Equation.
sufficient that U remain finite for all values of 0 and <f> included
within the limits of integration. Applying this principle to the
integral in (4) and (5), we see that the process of integration
will be legitimate if epn+1sm0 remain finite within the limits
of integration. Now it is evident that this expression can be
come very great only when n + 1 is negative and p( = PQ) is
very small. But if p is small, it is plain that 0 is small. It will be
sufficient, therefore, to consider the limiting value of epn+l sin 0
for very small values of 0. Now e, the density of distribution,
is proportional to the thickness of the shell at each point.
Hence if a line be drawn from 0, the centre of the sphere,
cutting the sphere and the original surface in Q, Q' respec
tively, the density of distribution, e, at the point Q, will be
proportional to QQ'. Now, observing that OP is a normal to
 both surfaces, we see that, if POQ ( = 0) be a small angle,
 QQ' cannot be of an order lower than 02. For both OQ and
 OQ' differ from OP by a quantity of this order. Hence
the greatest value which € can have at the point Q is K02,
where K is finite. Again, p = 2bs'm^0=b0 nearly, and
sin 0=6, to the same order. Hence epn+1 s'm0= K0n+* +
higher terms. It is evident, then, that epn+'s\n0 will not
be infinite for 0 = 0 unless n + 4<0. Laplace's equation is
therefore true for all positive values of n, and for all negative
values (except n=— 1) which are not numerically greater
than 4. The equation may be true for higher negative values
of n than —4, if the sphere have contact of an order higher
than the first with the original surface.
   It remains to determine the degree of approximation to
which the equation (2) is true. The order of the error in this
equation is the same as that of the assumption by which this
result was obtained, namely that a distribution on the surface
of the sphere may be substituted for the shell.
   Suppose that, in general, the potential of the shell is repre
sented by the integral

If this expression be restricted to the first power of *«, the
expression thus limited, namely

density is au. This is the form adopted by Laplace. The error
in his result is therefore of an order not lower than as, provided
that no one of the terms m2/'(b) sin 0, u3f"(b) sin 9, &c. become
infinite within the limits of integration.
    In the present case
/(r) = rV + 62 - 2br cos flfr = }-2 j (r _ b cos 0)2 + £2sin20 }• T.
 Assume x=r—b cos 0, y = 6 sin 0, z=xi+yi. Then
                   f(r) = rszm, putting m— ^t^-
    We have then to inquire whether any term such as
                         up+1 —;— sin 0
                                 drP
 becomes infinite when r=b. But as neither rsor its differen
 tial coefficients can become infinite, it will be sufficient to
 determine the conditions necessary in order that
                             nP+1 —.— sin 0
                                  drP

 according as p= 2q or = 2q + ] . In both these series, since z
 and x are both of the order 02, when # is small, it is easily
 seen that the first term is the term of the lowest order in 0.
 Moreover, as w = 0 and ^ = 0 when 0=0, it is plain that u is
 also of the order 6l when 0 is small. Hence when p = 2q, the
                          dp zm

and when p = 2q + 1, the order is
      4g> + 4 + 2(m— q — l) + 2 + l = 2g' + 2m + 5 = 2g + n + 6.
    The term retained in the value of v, (6), corresponds top = 0.
 The order of this term is therefore = order of a + n + 4, when
 6 is small. Hence ifn +4 be not < 0, the order of this
term must be = or > order of a. The order of the next term
 will = order of a2 + n + 6, and the orders of all succeeding
terms will be higher when 6 is small. The degree of the
approximation is therefore as has been stated.
    The same reasoning which has been applied to the potential
will hold also for the resolved attraction. In fact, as we have
 seen, when 6 is small the orders of the corresponding parts of
 the potential and of the resolved attraction are the same.
 Hence :—
    If quantities proportional to the square and higher powers of
the thickness of the shell be neglected, Laplace's equation is true
for all positive values of n, and for all negative values which do
 not numerically exceed 4.
    It will be observed that in the foregoing investigation I have
taken Laplace's equation to refer, not to the potentials and
attractions of the solids, but to the potential and attraction of
the shell included between them. It is upon this consideration
 that the validity of the proof of Laplace's equation depends
 for negative values of n numerically greater than 2 and not
 numerically greater than 4. For such values of n the differ
 ential expressions for the attraction and the potential admit of
 a true integration for the shell, or its equivalent the material
 distribution. But these expressions do not necessarily in such
 cases admit of a true integration for either of the solids. Thus,
 if n be numerically greater than 2 and not greater than 3, the
 differential expression for the attraction does not admit of a
 true integration ; and if n be greater than 3, neither expression
 admits of a true integration. In the former case the attrac
 tion is infinite, and in the latter both attraction and potential
 are infinite.
     Hence it is evident that the true cause of the failure of
 Laplace's equation (when it does fail) is that the quantities
 with which it is concerned cease to be finite. It does not fail
 for such a shell as Laplace describes, because the thickness of
 this shell is zero at the attracted point and exceedingly small
 in the immediate neighbourhood. It results from this con
 struction of the attracting shell, that the potential and resolved
 attraction remain finite for higher inverse laws of force than
 they would for an ordinary solid.

X LV. On the Specific Gravity of certain Substances in the Solid
      State and in Aqueous Solution. By J. A. Groshans*.
 USEFUL compilations, like those of Landolt and Born-
          steinf, render easy the observation of certain physical
properties characterizing whole classes of bodies. We have
been studying the specific gravities of some solid substances,
and we will proceed directly to the discussion of one or two
particular cases.
        Analogous Compounds of Potassium and Sodium.
   The atomic weight of sodium is 23 and its specific gravity
0*97; the atomic weight of potassium is 39 and its specific
gravity 087 : sodium is the heavier of the two.
   We find an apparent anomaly in all the compounds of these
two bodies : in the solid state the sodium compound possesses
a greater specific weight than that of the analogous compound
of potassium, the two specific gravities bearing to one another
the mean ratio of about 1*10 to 1. But for aqueous solutions,
with an equal number of molecules of water (for example 100
and 200), the reverse is true ; for then the density of the solu
tion which contains the potassium is always greater than the
one containing the sodium. Table A shows the first case.

   All the densities given in Table B are d -g, and not d rg.
Those given under the names of Gerlach and Kremers are not
the direct results of observation, like those of Thomsen and
Nicol. We have calculated them from other experiments of the
two observers; and we shall return later on to this calculation.
These densities have been added to the table to fill up gaps in
Thomsen's experiments. We have nothing to add concerning
the compounds of potassium and sodium ; we therefore pass
on to an analogous case.
          Analogous Compounds of Fluorine and Chlorine.
   It may have already been remarked, in Table A, how great
the specific gravities of KF and NaF are, compared with the
analogous compounds KC1 and NaCl. In reality this case
bears a strong resemblance to the one we have just been ex
amining. The compounds of fluorine, of which the molecular
weights are smaller than those of the analogous compounds of
chlorine, have greater specific gravities ; the difference in the
molecular weights CI— F is nearly equal to that between
K— Na ; being for CI— F = 16-5 for one molecule, 33 for two
molecules, and 49'5 for three molecules. However, the spe
cific gravities of the fluorine compounds are greater than those
of the chlorine compounds ; and the difference is about three
times more than in our first case : this will be evident on
referring to Table C.

   The two compounds of arsenic, AsF3 and ASCI3, are, as we
know, liquid at the ordinary temperature.

itself in solutions ; which of the two solutions has the greater

   We see in this table that the two solutions have equal
densities when they are sufficiently dilute.
   This example proves that the densities of solutions does not
depend upon the greatness of the molecular weight of the
dissolved substance ; for the molecular weight of KC1 is
greater than that of KF.
On the Method employed in calculating the Densities of a Solu
   tion, with arbitrary numbers of Molecules of Water, taking
   two experiments for the basis of the Calculation.
   In explaining this method of calculation, it will be necessary
for us to touch upon some of the results of our researches upon
solution, which have been published elsewhere.
   We may regard a solution as a compound of one part (a
gramme) of the soluble substance with a variable number of
grammes of water ; this number we will call aq. We shall
show that the density of a solution can be represented with a

    We see that the results obtained by use of the interpolation-
 formula leave nothing to be desired. The three results of the
 formula in the table have been calculated from two experi
 ments, the first and the fifth, which give:—
                a =0-380966               log a = 9-5807654
                # = 0-72844
          a + /3=l-1094l
    The sum (a+/8) has some importance. Suppose that a
 weighed quantity, say 10 grammes, of pure water, of which
 the volume at 4°= 10 cubic centimetres and at t° a little more,
 is added to a concentrated solution. Theoretically three cases
 can occur:—
     1. The increase of volume of the solution can be exactly
 equal to the added volume of the pure water : in this case we
 should have (a + /S) = l.
     2. The increase of volume can be less than the added water;
 this is the ordinary case. It is then said that the solution is
 accompanied by "contraction;" in this case we find (a 4-/3)
 greater than 1 ; in general the sum (a 4-/3) is between 1 and 2.
     3. In the third case the volume of the solution is increased

(a + /S) would be less than unity.
   Space does not allow of our saying more about the sum
   Instead of considering solution as a combination of one
gramme of the soluble body with aq grammes of water,
one often prefers to consider it as a diffusion of a molecule
part of the soluble substance, or a grammes (a being the
molecular weight of the substance in solution) through n
molecules of water ; instead of n we will employ the letter A.
In this case we can make use of the same interpolation-for
mula, after having modified it in the following manner :—
   Since A = a/18aq., we multiply both terms a and y8 by
a/18 ; the fraction remains unchanged; and the new inter
polation-formula becomes
in which v = a/18 a, and \ = a / 18&.
                       (v + \)18/o = « + /8.
   With this formula we have calculated the density of the solu
tion of sugar, Ci2Hj20,i, a = 342, according to the experiments
of Gerlach. For the integral values (in round numbers) of
A, we have taken, as the Dasis of our calculations, the two
following experiments of Gerlach :—

    Table F contains the results of our calculations. We have
chosen the same numbers for A that Marignac employed in
his experiments upon the solution of sugar: and we have
placed in the table the direct results of his observations, for
the purpose of comparison. We see that the results of the
two investigators, Gerlach and Marignac, very nearly agree.
Gerlach's figures are a little high ; but this little difference
may be attributed to the difference of temperatures t°, which
were 17°*5 C. for Gerlach and 20° C. for Marignac. We have
still to multiply all the densities observed by Marignac by
the number 1 •001731, because he has expressed them with
                                                      20°

   For d 20°/ 4° and d 20°/20° the densities (in Table G) have
been calculated three times from the first and fifth experiments.
   Using the densities 20°/ 20°, we have
               v= 7-30208            log v= 0-8634464,

         Sum... 19-8487             « + /S=l-0447.
   These figures are almost the same as those which were
obtained from Gerlach's two experiments.
   Table G shows that the interpolation-formula represents,
within a near approximation, the densities 20°/ 20°—that is to
say, the densities t°/l°; but not so well the densities 20°/ 4°,
or d t°/4.°.
   It would seem as if the density t°/t° were the expression
most suited to the nature of solution ; the conversion of d t°/t°
into dt°/4° might resemble somewhat an arbitrary change,
altering the nature of the results. At the same time, the den
sities t jt° have the advantage of making it easier to compare
the results of different observers. This would still more be
possible if all investigators were to make use of the same fixed
temperature t° when the so-called ordinary temperature is in
question.
   We could also wish that it were always clearly stated if the
temperature in question be t°jt° or /°/4°; one is often in doubt
about this important point, especially when obliged to cite
from second-hand sources. But we must proceed.
   We have shown the method we have employed in Kohl-
rausch's experiments on the solution of KF, which are de
scribed in the important work of G. Wiedemann on Electricity,
vol. i. p. 593. In all, we have chosen three experiments.

   We have commenced by changing the given densities (those
with three decimals), which we suppose to be 18°/4°, into
18°/ 18°. We have then calculated the two constants, taking
the mean of the first and third experiments ; and have thus
obtained the following mean result:—
              v = 2-69133         log v= 0-4299663

   Applying the formula thus obtained to the second experi

                   d 18°/ 18° (calculated) = 1-0861
   If a similar calculation be made for KC1 from Thomsen's
two experiments (given in Table D) corresponding with A = 15
and 100, the following results are obtained :—
                i/ = 2-6606          logv=0-4249793

          Sum ...5-7846             * + £=l-397
   We see that the two solutions (that of KF and that of KC1)
have almost the same v ; but the two \'s are a little different:
                          For KC1, \=3124
                            „ KF, \= 2-253
                           Difference =0-871
   This difference, which is somewhat large, varies with the
different densities of the two substances in the solid and anhy
drous state (see Table C).
   We may here mention a special property of our interpolation-
formula.
    If aq or A be made = 0, the formuhe become
 and they then express the specific gravity of the dissolved
 substance in the anhydrous state ; we call this particular
 value of d, 8.
    The value of B, calculated by the formula, in some cases
 approaches very nearly to that of direct observation. For
 example, Marignac gives somewhere the specific gravity of
 crystallized sugar as l-59.
    Now our calculations (from ti20°/20°) give
                           8 = 1+^=1-582.
                                   n
    Since, according to Table C, the specific weights 8, observed
 for KF and KC1, are respectively 2-48 and 1-98, and thus far
 from equal, it follows that in the two substances we may have
 v=v' (nearly), but not X=\'; for (assuming our interpolation-
 formula and the results of observation to be perfectly accu
 rate) we should have for
                      KF.                     KCL
              8=1+^=2-48;             5'=l+£=l-98.

 414    M. J. A. Groshans on the Specific Gravity of certain
 Whereas, starting from the values of v and \, which have been
 obtained by calculation (by means of two experiments for
 each substance), we have :—
             For KF, 8=2-19;           for KC1, 8=1-85.
   These figures do not agree so well as those for the sugur ; but
 the agreement appears to us sufficient.
    We see, in using this form of the interpolation-formula
that when two different substances have the same v (which
often occurs), but slightly different values of X, the densities
of the two solutions can differ slightly for small values of A;
but that the difference diminishes for greater values of A,
and that the two densities become equal when A=co . This
result for KF and KC1 may be seen in Table D.
   There are some substances which not only have the same
v but also the same X, which occurs (v, V being assumed
equal) when two similar substances have the same specific
gravity in the anhydrous state. We will give a single
example of this.
   On referring to Landolt's tables, we find for the two follow
 ing substances :—

                               Conclusion.
    It is possible to form groups of substances of which the
 densities are equal when A = A'. For instance, this is the
 case for the homonymous salts of Fe, Mn, and Cr. We call
 the following salts homonymous:—
                    RSO,; RClt; RN,0,j &c.
    The same holds good for the homonymous salts of Cu, Zn,
 Ni, and Co.

 have already been published) referring to this last case.

   For two substances which possess the same v the values of
a, «' are inversely proportional to the molecular weights a, a'.

416           Dr. T. Muir on un overlooked Discoverer
   It is often possible to foretell the value of v which a sub
stance will have, by making use of certain observations on
the properties of solutions. For instance, if two substances
be taken, RIS and RBr2, R being the same for both, it will be
found for the two substances,
                           v — /= constant.
   We may express this result in a more general manner,
thus :—
                          I — Br = constant.
   In the same way,
                          Br— CI = constant.
   And, further, these two constants are equal to one another;
so that we have
                     I - Br = Br - CI = constant.
   When two substances, such as RIS and R'lj, have R, R' dif
ferent, p.. g. Zn and Mg, we find in all cases, such as Znl3 and
Mg Ia, or ZnS04 and MgS04, &c,
                         Zn — Mg = constant.
   The metals Ca, Sr, Ba give (like CI, Br, I):—
                    Ba — Sr=Sr— Ca= constant.
   Space does not permit of our continuing this subject, which
we have treated elsewhere in several published papers.

XLVI. An overlooked Discoverer in the Theory of Determinants.
           By Thomas Muir, M.A., LL.L)., F.R.S.E.*
history of the Theory of Determinants, and notwithstanding
the fact that, practically, the history extends no further back
than somewhere about 130 years, there seems to be at least
one investigator of considerable importance who has been
altogether lost sight of. This is Ferdinand Schweins, born
at Fiirstenberg, Paderborn, in 1780, Professor in Heidelberg
from 1811, died in 1856. Some time ago I came into pos
session of his Theorie dtr Differenzen und Differentiale, a
handsome quarto volume of vi + 666 pages, published in 1825.
On reading the title-page, which enumerates six other subjects
besides Differences and Differentials, I found the names of two
                   * Communicated by the Author.

of them unfamiliar, viz. " gcdoppelte Verblftvel°Pme^0. *
" Producte mit Versetzungen," and turned over tPeorerns-?
pages to see what exactly these terms were used to ,
To my astonishment, " Producte mit Versetzungen " pnDarv
to be nothing more nor less than Determinants ; and I sc
saw that what I had been fortunate enough to light on was a
very complete treatise on the subject, extending to 1 13 pages.
    The historical interest attaching to this work of Schweins
would alone render it desirable that some account of the con
tents should be published; but an additional inducement exists
in the fact that some of the results are not without a savour
of freshness even at the present day.
    2. The Theorie der Producte mit Versetzungen begins at
p. 317. There is an introduction of four pages, in which the
author refers in the first place to mathematicians who had
previously dealt with the subject, and then indicates, in the
form almost of a table of contents, the nature and extent of his
own investigations. The names he mentions are those of Euler,
 Cramer, B^zout, Hindenburg, Rothe, Laplace, Desnanot, and
Wronski. One of these, Desnanot, it may be remarked, is
even now new to us in connexion with the history of Deter
minants. As for their influence upon Schweins, it may be
said in a general way that, while he belonged to the Combi
natorial School of Hindenburg, it seems to have been the
writings of Wronski that in the main directed and inspired
his efforts.
    What is not a little remarkable is the omission of Cauchy's
name, the one really great name that could have been referred
 to in connexion with the subject. Cauchy's memoir (Sur let
fonctions &c.) appeared in the year 1812 ; so that, so far as
date of publication is concerned, it would seem to have stood
 as good a chance of being known as either the work of
 Wronski (1811 &c.) or of Desnanot (1819). Its existence
 undoubtedly lessens the importance to be attached to Schweins'
work.
     3. The Theorie consists of four sections (Abtheilungen),
subdivided into portions which we may call Chapters. The
first Section has five chapters; the second alsofive ; the third,
one; and the fourth, four.
                         Sect. I. Chap. 1.
         On the Nature of "Producte mit Versetzungen.'1''
    4. The " elements " from which the products are formed
are denoted thus :—
                                 Ai, . . .

  416           Dr. T. Miuir on an overlooked Discoverer
      It is often p/»icn we now should use
  stance will r
  the prope-'                  A'.«>> Ai>o,;
  be taj^cter A being accompanied by two suffixed numbers, the
  fou'ond of which is itself a letter with a suffix.
y A determinant with elements of this kind is denoted by the
   principal term enclosed within the brackets
                                   II   );
  thus
                           •i «i
                        I, A, A,)     Aj Aj"~A| Aj.
  This notation, and no other, is used throughout the whole
  treatise. As the name " Producte mit Versetzungen " implies,
  the view taken of a determinant is as an aggregate of terms
  one of which gives rise to all the others by permutation of
  suffixes : naturally, therefore, determinants with elements
  other than those specified above do not occur, and " rows "
 and " columns " are things unthought of.
     The definition adopted is a statement of the recurring law
 of formation—that is to say, the law of development of a de
 terminant of the nth order in terms of determinants of the
 (n— l)th order; a definition, by the way, recently employed
 by Professor Cayley in his article on Determinants in the
 Encyclopaedia Sritannica.
     Immediately following the definition are given careful
 enunciations and proofs of the following theorems:—
     I. The suffixes being allowed to remain unchanged, the
 superfixes (die oberen Elemente) are interchanged in every
 possible way to obtain the full development.
     II. The sign preceding each term is dependent upon the
number of interchanges of places necessary to arrive at the
term.
    III. If two adjacent superfixes be interchanged, the sign of
the determinant is altered.
    IV. If a superfix be moved a number of places to the right
or left, the sign of the determinant is changed or not accord
ing as the number of places is odd or even.
    V. If several superfixes change places, the sign of the de
terminant is altered or not according as the number is odd or
even which indicates how often a smaller superfix follows a
greater.
    VI. If in any term the number which indicates how often
a smaller superfix follows a greater be even, the sign preceding
the term must be positive, and if the number be odd the sign
must be negative.
    VII. Instead of keeping the suffixes unchanged and inter-

                    in the Theory of Determinant'?.
changing the superfixes when finding the developlneiP ^e
may do the opposite with the same effect : and theorems?? as
to VI. hold when " suffix " is put for " superfix."                 v
   VIII. (Development of a determinant in terms of binary
products of a row and column.)
   This is given incidentally, but is quite generally stated and
proved.
   IX. (Development of a determinant in terms of products
of complementary minors.)
   This also is enunciated and proved in all its generality.
   X. If two suffixes or superfixes be identical, the determi
nant vanishes.
   XI. If the first element of a row of a determinant be mul
tiplied by the cofactor of the first element of another row, the
second element of the former row be multiplied by the cofactor
of the second element of the latter, and so on, the sum of the
products is equal to zero.
    Of these theorems only two, those here marked IX. and X.,
are claimed by Schweins as his own. This of course they
really are not ; X. having been enunciated by Vandermonde,
and IX. being due in some considerable part to Vandermonde
and Laplace. To Schweins, however, belongs distinctly the
credit of the formal and general enunciation of the latter
theorem, and a systematic proof of it.
   But although the individual results of the chapter were not
new when published, the chapter viewed as a whole (that is
to say, as an orderly arranged and rigidly demonstrated body
of truth) was undoubtedly " a new thing."
                             Sect. I. Chap. 2.
    5. The title of this chapter is not sufficiently definite ; it
should be Transformation of a series whose terms are products
of pairs of determinants into another similar series.
   The first identity which is given showing such a transfor
mation is in modern notation,
   I «iV3^4 1 1 "s/eS'v I — I aAc3ei 1 1 dif6g1 \
                          + I aAc3ft |! dse^ | - | ajV^ || <W? \
= \ «iV3 1 1 d4ebfeffr I - I «iV4 1 1 dtftftffi I
                          + I aAc* || (hfsfeffi \ — j 1 1 d&fegi I-
This Schweins establishes by expanding the first factor of each
product on the left-hand side in terms of the elements of its
 ast row and their complementary minors, and then, by means
of the same theorem, combining in new sets of" four the

416         »r. T. Muir on an overlooked Discoverer
   ft /fTterms thus obtained. In fact the sixteen terms may
^"written in order in four rows of four each ; and these
being viewed as four columns of four each, and the columns
summed, we obtain the right-hand member of the identity.
   It is then shown that this is a case of a general theorem in
which the factors of each product are determinants of the
(n + l)th and wth orders, the said theorem being accurately
and succinctly stated by means of a suitable notation.
   Even here, however, the matter does not end ; for by a
quite natural step Schweins passes on to a much more widely
general theorem, in which the factors on the one side are
determinants of the (/? + « + ?)th and (k+p)th orders, while
those on the other are determinants of the (p + «)th and
(q + k+p)th orders.
   The conclusion of the chapter is occupied with the state
ment of a considerable number of interesting special cases of
the latter theorem.
   6. There can be no doubt that almost every detail of this
chapter was new at the time of publication; and it is therefore
of some importance that the nature of its contents be properly
understood. This will be most readily attained if we present
them shortly in the light in which nowadays they would
naturally be viewed.
   In the case of the special identity with which the chapter
opens, a writer of the present time would only require to
direct attention to the determinant
                         "3  a*     ¦         ¦
                         b,        •    ¦    ¦

whose non-zero elements form a quadrate gnomon of the
dimensions 4, 7, 4 ; and point out that this determinant is
the natural sum, according to Laplace's expansion-theorem,
of the left-hand member of the identity, and likewise of the
right-hand member ; the former being obtained by developing
the determinant in terms of the minors of the 4th order got
from the first four columns, and the latter by developing it in
the same waj* in terms of the minors of the 4th order got from
the last four rows.

                  in the Theory of Determinants.                  421
   Then from the gnomon (4, 7, 4) he would pass to the
gnomon (p, n, q), n being unequal to p + q, and finding, as
before, its two developments in terms of complementary
minors with non-zero elements, would at once arrive at
Schweins' most general theorem.
   7. The essence of the chapter would thus be seen to be the
equating of the two possible developments of a quadrate gnomon
in terms of products of complementary minors with non-zero
elements ; and if we should wish to attach to the theorem a
depreciatory technical label, we might characterize it as but
the statement of the " dimorphic expansibility of a quadrate
gnomon."
   The very reverse of depreciation must, however, be our
feeling when we recall the date 1825 ; and when we bear in
mind the fact that a formal statement of the general identities,
independent of the way in which they may be established, has
not even yet found its way into our textbooks, such modern
mathematicians as Sylvester (1851) having enunciated only
special cases, and the masterly memoir of Rciss (1867) having
been as nearly as possible altogether neglected.
   8. The following is Schweins' statement of the most general
of the theorems :—
        „ , . «\                      on I I »,       Km-q) I
        ?±\h1...An_a B'1...B'J-[B'I+....B'. I
      = 2±|A1                       A„_J     Bx                B,|.
   The only points about it requiring explanation are the exact
effect to be given to the symbol Z and the meaning of the
dashes affixed to certain of the letters. The two symbols are
connected with each other, the dashes not being permanently
attached to the letters, but merely put in to assist in explain
ing the duty of the 2. On the left-hand member of the
identity the two symbols indicate that the first term is got by
dropping the dashes, and that from this first term another term
is got if we substitute for B, . . B? some other set of </ B's chosen
from Bj . . . Bm, and take the remaining B's to form the B's
of the second determinant, the two sets of B's being in both
cases first arranged in ascending order of their suffixes. On
the other side of the identity the use of the symbols is exactly
similar, n—q of the n superfixes ax, . . ., an being taken for the
first determinant of any term of the series and the remainder
for the second determinant. The number of terms in the
series on the one side is evidently m \/q !(m— q)\, and on the
other ii ! /q ! (n— q)l

  422           Dr. T. Muir on an overlooked Discoverer
     Thus iu the case where n = 4, y = 2, m = b the identity is
  written

 where the suffixes of the B's in the first factors of the terms
 on the left-hand side are in order
              12, 13, 14, 15, 23, 24, 25, 34, 35, 45,
 and the sign of any term is determined by the number of in
 versions of order among the suffixes of all the B's mentioned
 in the term ; while the suffixes of the a's in the first factors of
 the terms on the right-hand side are
                       12, 13, 14, 23, 24, 34;
and the sign of any term is determined by the number of
inversions of order among the suffixes of all the a's of the
term.
   9. The notation which in our time would almost certainly
be chosen for the statement of such identities is the umbral
notation of Sylvester. In outward appearance it is not
unlike that of Schweins, although in essence it is different.
The superfixes of Schweins are, like the suffixes, appendages
of the capital letters A and B; whereas with Sylvester, and
indeed also with Leibnitz and Vandermonde, the capital letters
are dispensed with. Using then
                        e .' ¦ " 1 for j AOT A4(3 A^ . . . ,
                    /8
and placing a line over or under the variables instead of
marking them with a dash, we may write Schweins' identity
thus:—
               a,.
        2±
                                                           • A.
               at . • "n-q                                 ¦ bm
                     .*„-,                         ft..    ¦ fim

                         in the Theory of Determinants.                             423
       This could scarcely be improved upon. The letters on the
    one side are in order exactly the same as those on the other;
    the only difference, in fact, between the sides being in the
    position of three of the straight lines.
        10. When in the generating gnomon one of the incomplete
    rows is identical with the corresponding part of one of the
    complete rows, or when more than one such pair of partially
    identical rows exist, a number of the products on the left-hand
    side vanish; and the theorem then becomes : —
               ax. • • ap+*        /V . . bq         1   I bv+i . . bq+k at . .
         2±

      =2±
                    • • *„+. 1
    This is the first special case which Schweins gives.
       The next case is virtually the same, as his notation leads
    him to consider as different two theorems which are derivable
    the one from the other by the interchange of rows and columns.
        The third case arises when in the generating gnomon
    there exist, in addition to the partially identical rows just
    referred to, one or more pairs of columns having the like partial
    identity : the theorem then is
   <*i                            h             bq             bq+i . . bh+k-p+q ax..ap

        The first two of these three special cases he then further
     specializes, putting in the first k=0, and in the result thence
     obtained 0 = 1, and so on.
        11. It is rather strange that Schweins did not observe what
    is perhaps the neatest, and certainly is now the best known

    the one side, and the rest on the other, some affected by the
    sign + and some by the sign — . A modification of this,
    which is simpler in that all the signs are positive, is given in
    my 'Theory of Determinants,' p. 124, viz.:—"The product of
    tico determinants of the same order is equal to the sum of like
    products obtained by interchanging q chosen columns of the one
    determinant with every set of q columns of the other in succes

    otlier, and so on."
        12. The only mathematician whom Schweins mentions as
    having preceded him in handling such identities as are given
    in this chapter is Desnanot, to whom he attributes the very
    simple instances

        It deserves, however, to be noted that Bezout was much
    more worthy of being mentioned. We find on pp. 185,
     186, 187 of the The'orie generate des Equations Algebriques,
    published in 1779, the identities

     the second of which is the same as the second of Desnanot's
    as given above, and the first and third are cases of Sylvester's
     Theorem. Besides it must be noted that these were viewed
     by their author as merely simple instances of an unlimited
     series of identities. His words are (p. 187, § 223):—
        "En voila assez pour faire connoitre la route qu'on doit
     tenir, pour trouver ces sortes de thdoremes. On volt quil y a

        There is thus no small share of credit to be assigned
     to Bezout. It is of no consequence as an objection to say
     that the identities are not given by Bezout in determinant

                  in the 'Theory of Determinants.              425

on looking at p. 211, Ac, where he uses
     (ab') for ab'-a'b,
     {ab'c") for (ab'-a'b)c"-(ab"-a"b)c' + (a'b"-a"b,)c,
 and so on. It was reserved for Professor Cayley, a hundred
years after the date of Bezout's work, to point out that the
 " proper proof" of the identities is by means of what we have
 called the generating gnomon (Quart. Journ. of Math. xv.
 pp. 55-57).

nants into other determinants when the elements are connected
by linear equations." What it really gives is the familiar
 solution of a set of simultaneous linear equations by means of
determinants.

    14. The subject-matter here is a special form of determinant,
viz. that in which each element is zero whose column- number
exceeds its row-number by more than unity. The one theorem
given is very interesting, and has not, I think, been published
elsewhere up till now.
   For the purpose of more readily giving expression to it, let
us use the symbol

       XLVII. On the Conductivity of Tourmaline for Heat.
                           By Franz Strenger*.
THEORETICAL considerations on the causes of pyroelec-
         trical phenomena led S. P. Thompson and 0. J. Lodgef
to the supposition tbat tourmaline possesses a unilateral con
ductivity tor heat in the direction of the principal axis, and
that therefore the conductivity in the direction from the ana
logous pole to the antilogous pole is different from the conduc
tivity in the reverse sense. To verify their assumption they
made two different series of experiments. In one of these
they used De Senarmont's method:—Slices of the crystal, cut
parallel to the axis, were covered with thin layers of wax, and
the curves were then observed to which the wax melted when
a point of the plate was warmed by applying a hot wire. They
then found, as they had supposed, that the isothermal curves

428            M. F. Stronger on the Conductivity
were not true ellipses, but appeared distorted in the direction
from the heated point towards the analogous pole.
   Such observations gave for the ratio between the semiaxes
of the isothermal curves, along the principal axis, the mean
value of 100 : 129.
   In a second series of experiments, a tourmaline slice, cut at
right angles to the crystallographic axis, was fixed between
two glass tubes ; into the upper of these a weighed quantity
of mercury was poured, while into the lower steam was blown.
The time was observed which was required to raise the tem
perature of the mercury through a given number of degrees.
   A difference in the conductivity, according to the direction
in which the heat flowed through the tourmaline, was also
observed by this method of experimenting. The mean values
of the times required to produce au equal elevation of tempe
rature bore to one another the ratio of 100 : 119.
   The few measurements made by Thompson and Lodge
differ so widely from one another, that the existence of a
unilateral conductivity cannot be inferred with certainty from
these experiments. Above all, it should first have been accu
rately ascertained that the slices used were perfectly homo
geneous; that is, that the crystal was not made up of a number
of crystalline individuals so grown together as to have the
analogous and antilogous poles, of different crystals, lying
beside one another in the same surface. It was therefore
desirable to find a better method of experimenting, to decide
 whether tourmaline possesses this abnormal conductivity for
heat or not.
    The experiments made by me for this purpose were per
 formed upon two slices cut at right angles to the principal
 axis. The one, about 5-8 millim. thick, was cut from a crystal
 from Brazil, belonging to the Mineralogical Institute of this
 University, and was placed at my disposal by Prof. Biicking;
 the other from a detrital peeble from Ceylon. Neither of them
 showed any trace of a fibrous structuro ; and a careful pyro-
 electrical examination, according to Kundt's* method, (which
 is founded on the principle of Lichtenberg's figures), showed
 that the two slices were in fact absolutely homogeneous; for the
 crystal having been heated, and, while cooling, dusted over
 with the proper mixture, showed one of the two surfaces per
 fectly yellow, the other perfectly red.
    The method employed in experimenting on the conductivity
 for heat has been adapted from one used by F. Weberf for
 liquids. A thermoelectric junction, fixed in a copper cylinder,

rests on the tourmaline plate. Both the junction and the plate
are allowed to acquire the temperature of the room; the under
surface of the slice is then cooled to 0° C. by bringing it in
contact with a smooth surface of ice, and the change of tem
perature is read off on the scale of a delicate mirror-galvano
meter. The galvanometer (fig. 1, G) used by me was one of
small resistance, with an astatic needle and a powerful damper.
                               Fig. 1.
   The one junction (a) of the thermoelectric element (a copper
cylinder about 4 millim. high, upon the surface of which a
platinum and an iron wire were soldered) rested, to insure
good contact, upon a small layer of mercury (b) on the tour
maline plate (/); both junctions of the platinum and iron
wires with the galvanometer-wires dipped into a glass vessel
(c) containing oil of turpentine, which was placed in a wooden
box lined with cotton-wool in order to keep the temperature
as constant as possible. The temperatures were read off upon

430             M. F. Stronger on the Conductivity
a Geissler's thermometer, w ith which it was possible to read
to the 100th of a degree.
   In the beginning of an experiment, F. Weber caused the
temperature of the lower surface of the substance to be ex
amined to sink to 0° C, and to remain there by placing the
crystal plate and the metal vessel containing the thermo-junction
directly upon a smooth surface of ice. I could not adopt this
method of proceeding ; for the weight of the tourmaline slice
and the copper cylinder was too small to drive away the water,
Produced by the melting ice, and to preserve a good contact,
   have therefore preferred to leave the tourmaline slice un
changed in its position, and, by a special arrangement, to
approach the plane surface of the ice (d) from below, and to
Eress it so tightly as to drive the water away from the neigh-
  ourhood of the tourmaline plate.
    For this purpose the slice (/) was cemented, with a little
wax and rosin, to an ebony plate (e), which was penetrated by
a hole of the required size, and this again to a short glass
tube (<?); the glass tube was then clamped to a retort-stand.
    Vertically under the plate was the shorter arm of a U-tube
(h), which communicated with the other by means of a thinner
tube provided with a stopcock. In the shorter arm was a
test-tube, movable with little friction : upon the upper end of
this, directly under the tourmaline itself, a glass plate (k) was
cemented. The U-tube was filled with mercury until the glass
plate was about 2 centim. under the surface of the crystal ;
the stopcock was then closed, and the longer arm filled to the
top with mercury. If it was now required to cool the lower
surface of the tourmaline plate to 0° C, a piece of ice (about
1 centim. thick), possessing a plane surface, was placed upon
the glass plate, and the cock opened; the mercury in the longer
arm then raised the test-tube, and with it the ice, and pressed
the latter firmly against the crystal.
    In order to be able to compare the results of different expe
 riments, I kept the temperature of the room as constant as
 possible ; if the temperature got too high in the course of the
 afternoon, I stopped the experiment and proceeded with it
 the next morning. Besides this, sufficient time was allowed,
 by every measurement, to enable the whole extent of the
 crystal to acquire the same temperature as the thermoelectric
junction (a) and the air of the room.
    Before and after every experiment, I made certain that no
 electromotive force could come into play other than that caused
 by the difference of temperature between the copper cylinder
 and the thermoelectric junction in the oil of turpentine.
 Lastly, the ice approached the tourmaline so rapidly that,

                      of Tourmaline for HeaU                    431
 before the contact, no change of temperature of the junction
 (a) was observable.
    The experiment was conducted in tho following way :—I
 first observed the position of the needle at rest with a closed
 circuit ; I then short-circuited the current (excluding the three
 thermoelectric junctions) to convince myself of the absence
 of every other electromotive force ; the temperature of the
 turpentine was now read, and after removing the short circuit
 the deviation of the magnetic needle observed. The piece of
 ice was then placed on the glass plate of the test-tube, the stop
 cock opened, and with the nelp of a chronometer the moment
 of contact between the ice and the tourmaline slice observed
 through a telescope. In order to keep the readings for the
 different times expressed in divisions of the scale, the junction
 (a) was then immediately placed in ice and the deviation noted.
 The results were controlled at the end of every experiment by
 observing whether the temperature of the turpentine and the
 deviation of the needle, by open and by short circuit, were
 the same as before.
    In this way a number of experiments were made for both
tourmaline slices, sometimes the analogous, sometimes the
antilogous, end of the crystal being brought into contact with
the ice. The results I representee! graphically by means of
curves, of which the number of seconds, reckoned from the
first contact of the tourmaline with the ice, form the abscissae,
and the corresponding temperatures of the junction (a), ex
pressed in scale-divisions, the ordinates. The galvanometer
was so arranged that about sixty divisions on the scale corre
sponded to 1 C. difference of temperature.
   Of the curves thus obtained only the middle one has been
used. The first shows, naturally, a less regular course; while
the last is also useless, because the changes of temperature
towards the end of the experiment took place rather slowly,
making the errors of observation of course greater. For
the thicker slice I have used, in the construction of the curve,
the part between the abscissas t = 20 seconds and <j = 200
seconds ; for the thinner, in which the rise of temperature
takes place with more rapidity, from <=20 to ^ = 150 seconds.
   In consequence of the unavoidable variations in the tempe
rature of the room in which the observations were made, the
first few ordinates of the temperature-curves obtained in the
different experiments are not quite equal ; the greatest differ
ence which I have allowed amounts to 3 per cent. In order to
obtain from all the experiments the probable change of tem
perature for one and the same position of one of the slices, I
have increased or diminished the curve in such a way that for

< = 20 seconds the ordinates of all the curves have one and the
same value. For the later times the different curves will be

 somewhat differently shaped ; and the most, probable tempe
 rature-curve for any particular temperature at commencing
 will be obtained if, for its ordinates, the mean values of the
 ordinates of the new curves be chosen. Tins method of pro
 ceeding is not strictly correct. As, however, experiment shows
 that the different temperatures at commencing of corresponding
 curves approach one another more and more as one proceeds to
 greater abscissae, and the variation among the individual curves
 being moreover small, the error can be of little importance.
    Concerning the curves, which have been reduced so as to
 have the same temperature at commencing, I only repeat the
 statement that the deviations amount at most to 3 per cent.
 In figs. 2 and 3 I give the most probable temperature-curves,
 obtained in the way given above, for the two slices : here A
 denotes the line obtained when the flow of heat is from the
 analogous to the antilogous pole, and the corresponding one

          On the Electrical Resistances of Metallic Wires.    433
   As may be seen, the curves A and B for both plates approach
one another very nearly. The greatest difference between
two corresponding ordinates is about 1 per cent., or not more
than the differences which have occurred in experimenting
with the slice in one position.
    From this the inference may be drawn that a unilateral
conductivity for heat is present in tourmaline either to a very
small degree or, what seems more probable, not at all.

XLVIII. On the Alterations in the Electrical Resistances of
    Metallic Wires, produced by Coiling and Uncoiling. By
    James Hopps, Superintendent of Workshops, Royal Indian
    Engineering College, Cooper's Hill*.
                                 [Plate IX.]
DURING the past winter, while assisting a pupil to make
          some resistance-coils, I was struck with the great dif
 ference that often existed between the resistance of the wire
 before it was coiled on to its bobbin and after ; the difference
 was not always constant or proportional to the length of the
 wires used, and appeared to bo largely influenced by the
 tension with which the wires were coiled on to the bobbins.
     Some of the coils altered so much after winding as to lead
 to the supposition of their being short-circuited; and on un
 coiling several of these and recoiling at a lower tension, the
 resistance would alter considerably.
     The diameter of the bobbin used also appeared to have great
 influence in producing changes in the resistance.
     A great portion of the alterations appeared to be temporary.
     As has been observed above, the differences were not always
 constant ; neither were they regular in their signs, t. e. they
 would sometimes show an increase and sometimes a decrease
 of resistance, but generally the change would be one of increase.
     Having resolved to make some efforts to clear up this matter,
  I first sought to find what had been done by others in this
  direction. A very careful search through books and also of
  the Transactions of the Royal Society afforded no evidence
  that this field had been even entered upon, i. e. any attempt
  by experiment or otherwise to determine and account for the
  effects of coiling and uncoiling on the electrical resistance of
  metallic wires.
      After experimenting some weeks, I purposely attended the
  meeting of this Society on February 23rd to hear a paper,
                  * Communicated by the Physical Society.

 434          Mr. J. Hopps on the Alterations in the
 " On the Adjustment of Resistance-Coils," by Prof. Silvanus
 P. Thompson ; and although some of the difficulties in the way
 of adjusting resistance-coils were spoken of, yet the difficulty
 that had given us so much trouble was not once alluded to,
 either in the paper or in the discussion which followed. At
 the close of the proceedings, in the course of a short conver
 sation with Prof. Thompson, and in reply to a question from
 myself, he stated that he had observed that the resistance of a
 wire was altered by being coiled. Mr. Latimer Clark also
 observed that he had noticed the change, but added that the
  changes were not always constant, giving sometimes an
  increase and sometimes a decrease in the resistance. Now
 experiments had given me the same results, and had the
 subject cropped up during the discussion, I had prepared a
 few notes to give to the meeting.
     The fact of having obtained sometimes + and sometimes
 — readings had puzzled mo much, but after the conversation
 above alluded to I resolved to continue my experiments; and
 although these are yet far from complete, I have felt it my
 duty to lay the results already obtained before the Society.
     Before going into a description of the apparatus and method
 employed (part of the apparatus is before you), I would crave
 a few moments to allude to some of my earlier experiments.
 These were conducted in a very primitive way ; but the results
 obtained, although appearing so erratic and contradictory,
 have been in a great measure confirmed by using the more
 elaborate method employed later on. In confirmation of this
 I would draw your attention to the great resemblance which
 exists between the two curves on the diagram, which are the
 curves of copper wires produced by hand- and machine-
 winding respectively.
    The method first employed to investigate this effect was to
 let the wire under test form one side of a Wheatstone bridge,
doubling the wire into a loop as in a resistance-coil, and rolling
it by hand on to a cylinder or other shapes in wood. The
resistance could thus be taken after each operation without the
necessity of altering the connexions.
    The time lost in waiting until the heat imparted to the wire
through handling had disappeared was great, and the uncer
tainty as to the tension with which the wire was coiled and
uncoiled caused me to seek some other method.
    After many schemes the one before you was adopted. Bear
ing in mind that many of the wires to be experimented upon
would not be insulated, and would be of many different dia
meters and rigidities, it was very early evident that the drum
on which the wires were to be coiled would also have to insu
late each convolution from its neighbour as well as to wind up

            Electrical Resistances of Metallic Wires.         435
the wire. The different diameters and rigidities also deter
mined the necessity of being able to vary the tension. The
insulation is obtained by using an ebonite drum to receive the
wire ; on this drum a right- and left-handed screw has been
cut. The variation in the tension may be obtained in two
different ways, or by a combination of both:—1st, by altering
the load carried in the little waggon which runs up and down
the inclined plane ; 2nd, by altering the angle of inclination
of the plane ; or we may combine both if necessary.
   As the application of longitudinal strain to a wire while
being tested for resistance has been shown to be considerable,
it was necessary to relieve the wire from the strain due to the
load before taking the resistance, otherwise the changes due
to strain would have been included in the readings. To
remove the strain, the waggon on arriving at the bottom of
the plane rests against a stop ; on being drawn to the top the
plane is brought to a position slightly above the horizontal ;
these allowing in both cases the drum to slightly unwind itself,
and consequently the strain on the wire is almost entirely
removed.
   The ebonite drum, as before observed, has a right- and left-
handed screw cut upon it ; these meet in the middle of its
length. A screw holding down an ebonite cap here passes
through the inside of the loop of the wire under test, and fixes
it firmly, but without injury, to the drum ; the ends of the wire
are carried up the plane to two binding -screws, and with the
necessary leading wires form one side of a Wheatstone bridge.
    A long length of stout whipcord is attached to the middle
of a winding drum underneath the head of the plane, and the
ends, after being coiled between the empty threads of the
 ebonite drum (starting from the centre), are fixed to the ends
 of the drum. On turning the drum below, the cords pull on
the top part of the ebonite drum, causing it to revolve; and at
the same time that the cord is being payed off, the wire under
test is being coiled on in its place. This is continued until
the waggon arrives at the top ; a pawl working on a ratchet-
wheel prevents the waggon running back until the plane has
been brought to a horizontal position, where, after resting five
minutes, the resistance is taken. The operations are now
reversed ; and after a similar rest at the bottom, the resistance
is again taken. And these operations are repeated, each ope
ration taking about six minutes, giving an average of ten per
hour ; they were generally continued for three hours, giving
for each series about thirty readings, and then allowed to stand
until the following evening, all strain being previously removed.
    The temperature of the laboratory was carefully regulated
each evening, for two hours before commencing work, to the

436          Mr. J. Hopps on the Alterations in the
same temperature as on the previous evening, and kept con
stant within half a degree Fahr. + .
   In the case of some wires as many as 380 readings have
been taken altogether ; this was on lead wire No. 5. At the
end of the seventh series the wire broke.
   The curves of resistance of four of the seven series of testa
on this wire is very interesting. It will be observed that, while
being very similar to each other, there is a point marked (a)
on each series where coiling and uncoiling produce an increase
in the resistance. Again, the wonderful power of recovery
which is shown by the wire after each rest is very marked ;
the normal condition would appear to be to give positive and
negative readings, and that this condition is upset after a
time. The inability to recover this condition has suggested
that, when this point has been arrived at, it might be said to
represent the commencement of a kind of electrical fatigue.
   There are some other points on this diagram, and which
are more or less repeated by every other wire that I have
tested, which furnish matter for speculation ; such as—why
should coiling generally produce a less effect than uncoiling ?
and why should the signs be generally different? and why
should those signs in many cases become reversed ?
   An increase of resistance on uncoiling and a decrease on
coiling take place with lead, copper, German silver, alumi
nium, and magnesium ; and also with the first few operations
on soft iron wire, after which the signs are completely changed.
   An increase almost invariably follows coiling and uncoiling
with zinc, but the effect of coiling varies from one half to one
thirtieth of the effect of uncoiling.
   The difference between coiling and uncoiling, or, we might
say, the amplitude of the differences of resistances, is greatest
in the case of magnesium and least in the case of aluminium ;
the latter, on referring to the curves, will be seen to alter very
little indeed.
   The amplitude of the differences in the case of hard-drawn
German silver is not so great after a few series ; and when
annealed, after showing great increases after standing at rest,
the final series approach very near to that of the hard-drawn
wire, which is strong evidence indeed that the wire has become
harder through repeated coiling and uncoiling.
   The length of the wires were very carefully taken before and
after the experiments, and the necessary calculations made for
alterations in length and cross-section according to the formula
R oc 4 in which R = the resistance, I = the length, and a =
the area of the cross section.

   "With magnesium No. 2, from a different sample from No. 1,
the wire became shorter ; and the resistance, which should
have fallen "0745 percent., actually increased 1*475 per cent.,
being equivalent to a difference of l-549 per cent, on the
original resistance unaccounted for.
   With magnesium No. 1 the actual increase of resistance
amounted to 2*16 per cent, on the original resistance, whereas
theoretically it should have increased 3"39 per cent., or 1'23
per cent, greater than really took place ; or we may say that
of the theoretical increase only 54-35 per cent, was visible,
showing that the specific conductivity of the wire had risen.
Four portions of this wire were tested, and the results were
all very near alike.
   On examining the results obtained with German silver
No. 5 (annealed), which after all is most likely to interest us,
owing to its employment in resistance-coils, we find that the
total increase was equal to '454 per cent.; and after deducting
•4 per cent., which is due to increase in length and diminution
of section, there still remains unaccounted for "054 per cent,
on the original resistance, or 11 "89 per cent, of the whole
observed change.
    With German silver (hard-drawn) the results are very
curious. Here the length actually decreased ; and on making
the necessary corrections, the resistance should have shown a
decrease of *284 per cent.; but the actual decrease was only
equal to "Ooti per cent., not low enough by "248 per cent. ; or
we may say that of the theoretical decrease only 12-26 per
cent, was visible.
   On examining the curves from the iron wires Nos. 3 and 4,
it will be observed that at the commencement uncoiling pro
duced a very large increase, while coiling produced a small
decrease ; but after sixteen operations in one case and twenty

438           Mr. J. Hopps on the Alterations in the
 one in the other, the signs became reversed, and this continued
 throughout the remaining series of the two wires.
    On page 74, vol. vi. of the ' Proceedings of the Physical
 Society,' I find a paper by Mr. Herbert Tomlinson, in which
he says that " the behaviour, of nickel is especially worthy of
 notice, because in it longitudinal traction, when not carried
 beyond a certain limit, diminishes the electrical resistance in
 6pite of the increase of length and diminution of section which
ensues."
    I have not been able to obtain wires in nickel, but, accord
ing to the results obtained, some samples of magnesium appear
to have the same property.
    At the last moment Prof. Stocker has shown me that in
Die Electrieitat, by Wiedemann, it is noted that " the coiling
of a copper or iron wire increases, whilst the uncoiling dimi
nishes the specific resistance about 0*003 of the total value of
the same."
    And, again, in Die Physik, vol. Hi., by Mousson, that " the
coiling of a wire upon a cylinder slightly increases the resist
ance, in consequence, as is supposed, of tension ; uncoiling
diminishes it again. Under similar circumstances, the changes
amounted to 0*0032 in the case of copper and to 0 0056 in
iron, of their total resistances."
    It will be observed that both these descriptions are contrary
 to what I must conclude from my own experiments.
    Having made some inquiries from a friend of mine who
 had charge of the testing department in the cable factory of
J. B. Pirelli, F. Casassa et Cie, of Milan, he has supplied
me with data which show that the specific conductivity of the
copper conductors have fallen in many cases              per cent,
during manufacture, and when encased in lead tubes they
have often fallen over 2 per cent. In all Cases the necessary
 corrections have been made for increase of length and dimi
 nution of section due to strain in passing through the covering
machines. Possibly the greater loss in the lead-encased core
may be due to a damping-effect from the lead, but the bulk
of the increase of resistance must be due to some other cause.
 These cables were manufactured under very strictly enforced
conditions for the Italian State Telegraph-stores ; and the tests
taken by government officials, ten weeks after they had been
sent from the factory, were in all cases within 0"2 per cent,
of the final tests in the factory, showing conclusively that the
changes wore in a great measure permanent.
   I have therefore come to a very decided conclusion that the
changes in the resistance are not altogether the result of changes
in form, and that their cau.«e must be sought for elsewhere.

              Electrical Resistances of Metallic Wires.        439
     Many theories have suggested themselves, but none are
  entirely satisfactory.
     One theory was that, in coiling, the decrease of resistance
  was due to a thickening of the wire on its internal side and a
  thinning of the external side, thus bringing the centre of area
  inwards, and so making the actual distance the current would
  have to travel shorter, which would be equivalent to making
  the wire shorter ; and then on uncoiling, the displacement of
  the molecules, due to slipping on each other when seeking to
  regain their original position, would have the effect of increa
  sing their distance apart, and consequently increasing the
  resistance. But the weak point in this theory is that it will
 not account for the change of signs which so often takes place,
 nor will it account for the zinc wires giving increased resist
 ances on coiling.
    Another theory, which appears more promising, was that,
 while being coiled and uncoiled, the wires were subject to
 strains of a torsional kind, which might be due to their having
 a certain amount of residual twist in them, owing to the way
 in which they have been coiled on to the drums on the bench
 of the wire drawer; and that on being coiled and uncoiled on
 their bobbins this twist might be increased or decreased, so
 giving different amounts in the resistance. But from experi
 ments I have made, which seem to me quite conclusive, it
 appears that although there is a certain amount of twisting
 and untwisting produced by being wound on to the bobbins,
yet this fails to account for the residue of the observed changes.
    With reference to the effects on the permanency of value of
a set of resistance-coils which are only subjected to one wind
ing, I have not yet sufficient data to lay before you ; but, so
 far as I have gone into this part of the subject, 1 believe that
the immediate alterations on coiling the wires on the bobbins
are to a great extent affected by the tension and the speed
with which they are wound, the thickness and kind of insu
lator employed (cotton-covered wires appear to be less affected
than silk-covered wires), and also by the diameter of the bob
bins on which the wire is wound (the smaller the bobbin the
greater the alteration) . But further experiments are necessary
to put these beyond doubt.
    Appended to this paper are a few tables showing the actual
readings in the first series of several of the wires tested (these
readings include the resistance of the leading wires, -0274).
These, together with the curves (PI. IX.), may be of some
service in assisting to a conclusion as to the probable cause of
the changes in the resistance of wires produced by coiling and
uncoiling.

     By F. KOHLBATJSCH*.
  W HENEVER a magnet forms the object or means of any
              measurement^ there are especially the following pro
 perties to be taken into account. Besides its magnetic moment,
 the changes in the same with temperature and with the position
 in the magnetic field play an important part, the distribution
 of magnetism in the bar. and, as a first approximation, the dis
 tance apart of the poles of the magnet is of importance ; and
 the moment of inertia of the heavy mass has to be taken into
 account in all the usual methods of observation.

    I take the present opportunity of communicating some
observations and experiments upon each of these four mag
nitudes.
    The results of the first part of the investigation, undertaken
conjointly with Mr. W. Hallock, will appear shortly in detail.

II. On the Increase and Decrease in Magnetic Moment produced
                              by Small Forces.
    We discuss here a single point, but a fundamental point in
the doctrine of induced magnetism. If we expose a steel
magnet to the action of feeble forces by which its magnetism
is either strengthened or weakened, the question arises whether
the increase and decrease in strength are of equal or of dif
ferent magnitude. Lamontf has occupied himself with this
inquiry in his extended magnetic researches, and found that
the enfeeblement takes place more easily than the reinforce
ment, and about in the proportion 4:3; and this view seems
to have been partially accepted by those % who have occupied
themselves with the subject. No thorough experimental in
vestigation, however, appears to exist, and yet it is a subject
of the greatest importance in the more exact magnetic and
 electrical measurements. Wild considers the determination
 of the coefficient of induction as one of the chief difficulties
in the measurement of the intensity of terrestrial magnetism,
and, to avoid it, even proposes§ to bring the oscillating mag
 net into a position at right angles to the meridian by means
 of a bifilar suspension.
     Whilst it must be admitted that there is, in fact, a certain
difficulty in the determination of the two different coefficients,
yet this is much lessened if we have simply to determine their
sum according to the method of induction-currents given by
Weber || . If we have established a nearly constant ratio
between the coefficients, we of course need only to know
their sum.

448     Prof. F. Kohlrausch on the Increase and Decrease
    It has always appeared to me most probable that this rela
tion must exist, but not in the way assumed by Lamont, but
 simply as an equality. Lamont's experiments do not seem to
be sufficient to justify the view originally taken by him.
 Later, Lamont appears* to return to the former view without
 expressly saying so. He refers only briefly to some experi
 ments " previously published " by him, but does not mention
 their result again. On the contrary, he calculates as if both
coefficients were of equal magnitude for very small forces,
and speaks of this as the generally accepted view.
    This latter view is indeed, a priori, the most probable, for it
corresponds to the law of permanency.
    The analogy, employed by Lamont, that a distorted elastic
body is more easily caused to return to its natural form than
to recede further from it, cannot be considered as of much
force. This fact of molecular mechanics is no doubt true for
persistent alteration of form. The limit of elasticity of a bent
body is, we know, greater outwardly than inwardly ; and so,
of course, a magnet will in general behave towards forces
which are sufficiently great to cause a permanent alteration in
its magnetism. But we are not now concerned with that. The
change in magnetic moment depending upon change in posi
tion relative to the earth is to be compared to elastic changes
in form, and for these there is no doubt that the modulus of
elasticity is of equal magnitude in both directions.
   I have abundantly convinced myself of the correctness of
both of these assertions. A magnet which had been exposed
some 8000 times to a weakening force of the magnitude of
the earth's horizontal magnetism (02 centimetre-gramme-
unit) showed still the same magnetism as before to within 2 0 •
And, as far as the modulus of elasticity is concerned, I tound
this the same in both directions in a soft-steel rod which
had been just before much bent. I have endeavoured, with
the important assistance derived from the observations of
M. Kreichgauer, to decide this question in the following
manner.
   First I employed Weber's method of currents induced in a
rotated spiral by the varying magnetism, employing only rota
tions of 90°; viz. first, from the east and west position of the
magnet into the normal position (north pole towards the north),
and, secondly, into the reversed position (north pole towards
the south). The deflections of the galvanometer-needle in the
two cases were found to be perceptibly equal.
   A difference of less than 1 per cent, in favour of the coeffi
cient of increase is easily accounted for by a small error in the
adjustment of the spiral.

   Weber's method becomes more convenient and more exact
if, instead of reversing the magnet and spiral with reference
to the earth's magnetism, we reverse a magnetic force with
reference to the spiral and the magnet in the spiral. For this
purpose the induction-spiral was further wound with 280 turns
of wire, forming a coil of 5 centim. diameter and a total
length of 39 centim., through which a current was passed,
producing within the spiral a magnetic field of about 0'2 C.(i.S.
unit, and thus of about the same strength as the earth's hori
zontal magnetism. This current was made or interrupted so
as to inciease or to diminish the magnetism of the bar. Mo
mentary currents were thus induced in the inner spiral, which
were measured by the method of multiplication. Moreover,
the part of the induced current resulting from the magnetizing
current itself could bo compensated by means of a second
duplicate spiral, which is an advantage of this electromagnetic
method. A similar arrangement has already been described
by Topler and Von Ettingshansen*. Local disturbances are
eliminated by reversal of the current and magnet.
    In order to infer the induced magnetism from the deflec
tions of the galvanometer, a small magnet of known moment
was employed, by the use of which experiments according to
the method of multiplication could be made by introducing
the magnet into the spiral and withdrawing it.
    The steel bars were examined in various conditions of hard
 ness and intensity of magnetization, as detailed in the first
column of the following Table. The mass m of the bars is
given in grammes, the magnetic moment in centimetre-gramme
units, and under s the specific magnetism ^ or the magnetic
 moment per gramme of steel.                         rn
    Lastly, under + As and —As are given the specific induc
 tion constants ; so that the numbers denote the change in
specific magnetism ; in other words, the increase or decrease
in the magnetic moment of the unit of mass (1 gr.) which
is produced by the unit of magnetizing or demagnetizing
force (gr.* cm.-* sec.-1).
    By way of explanation, it may be observed that the number
As represents nearly the change in specific magnetism pro
duced in our latitudes by reversing the bar in the direction of
 the dip-needle. About the fifth part is the " magnetism of
 position " produced in 1 gr. in our latitude by the earth's
 horizontal magnetismf.

   t Multiplied by 7-l> (the density of steel) (he numbers s or As give the
specific magnetism or induction-constant (as the case may be) referred to
unit volumes, which latter, as Herwig has remarked, represent absolute
numbers, and are thus independent of the units employed.

    There is no decided difference in any one of these numbers
between the coefficient +A« of increase of strength and the
coefficient of decrease in strength —As.
    The small differences of irregular sign are due to errors of
observation, and are caused, for the most part, b}" variations
in the strength of the inducing current. The mean values
show exact equality.
    It is thus proved that there is no inequality in the coeffi
cients of increase and decrease of any such proportion as 3 : 4
or anything like it ; but that for practical purposes we need
only admit one coefficient of change of magnetism produced by
external forces, whether they tend to increase or to decrease
it. This is, of course, true only within certain limits ; how
far these limits extend must be left for further investigation.
I will only remark here that, with forces which amount to
about half of the earth's horizontal magnetism, more or less,
we arrive practically at the same numbers.
    It appears from these results that this subject has been
invested with unnecessary difficulty. One other point, it is
true, remains undecided, viz. the question whether, and under
what circumstances, a change of the induced magnetic moment
with time can be disregarded. Without doubt such an influ
ence exists, but for magnets of hard steel it may no doubt be
neglected in practice.

   III. On the Determination of the Temperature Coefficient
                           of a Magnet.
   The following general and sensitive method may be added
to the known methods of W. Weber and Lamont. The bar
to be examined is brought near to a reflecting magnetic needle
in the horizontal plane of the needle so that its centre point
lies in the meridian of the needle, and so that it, acting together
witli the earth's magnetism, brings the needle into an east-and-
west position. Let the bar in this position make an angle <f>
with the meridian. If now the magnetism M of the bar
change by an amount AM, the needle will alter its position
by the small angle Ae. Then, apart from corrections (com
pare below), it is easily seen that wo have
                         -jj-=itan<£. Ae.
We observe that this method may be made very sensitive by
choosing the distance of the magnet from the needle so that
the angle <f> shall be small.
   For the practical employment of this method it is very con
venient to have the magnetic bar on the rotating arm of a
graduated circle. As a magnetic needle I have employed a
steel disk with reflecting surfaces. The method of procedure
is then as follows:—
    In order to measure the angle <f>, the magnetic bar is rotated
from its original position until the image of the scale is seen
in the second reflecting surface. This rotation amounts then
to 2(f>. The rotating arm in the two positions differing by 2<f>,
is struck, and the magnet rotated in each observation between
the strokes, i. e. when cold and when hot. The influence
of small unintentional rotations of the magnetic axis of the
bar, such as might be produced by the heating itself, is thus
avoided.
   Let A be the distance of the scale from the mirror at the
one temperature t. Let the positions 6j and e2 of the needle
be observed upon rotation of the bar through the angle l2tf>,
and at the other temperature t' the positions e\ and e'2. If
we denote ei— e2 by n and e\—e'2 by n', then the relative
loss of magnetism,

  452                 Prof. F. Kohlrausch on the Bifilar
      Corrections for the Length of the Rod.—It would not be
  practicable to make the distance of the magnet from the needle
  so great that the length of the bar might be neglected ; since
  for a considerable distance there would exist no angle <f>
  which would bring the needle into a transverse position. We
  may take account of the length of the rod by multiplying the
  above result by
                           1+^(3 + 5cob»*).
  In this a is the distance of the middle point of the magnet
  from the needle, A. the distance apart of the poles of the
 magnet—that is, in the case of bar-magoets, five sixths of the
 length of the bar.
     IV. On the Bifilar Determination of Moments of Inertia.
     Gauss's well-known method of determining the moment of
 inertia of a body from its oscillations, when loaded and in the
 unloaded condition, eliminates the unknown directive force of
 the oscillations. The employment of a known directive force
  (e. g. of a bifilar* directive force) permits the employment of
 a simpler method.
     I was induced to investigate this method of determination
 by obtaining, by means of suspended weights, inconsistent
 measurements of the moment of inertia of a magnetic bar, and,
 in spite of the greatest care, a result too great, as could be
 concluded from geometrical measurement of the carefully
 worked bar.
     The method was carried out by means of the bifilar- suspen
 sion arrangement recently described by mef. We determine
 first the moment of inertia of the bifilarly-suspended carrier
    • Kohlrausch, Wied. Ann. xvii. p. 744 (1882).
    t By adopting the extremely convenient method of M. Wild, in which
 the oblique surfaces over which the wires run are replaced by surfaces at
 right angles to which the wires are clamped (Rcp.f. Meteor, d. K. Acad,
d. Wins. St. PeterA), vii. No. 7, 1883).
    I may be allowed to remark here that I am quite unable to regard my
methud of the " bifilar " measurement of the earth's magnetic intensity as
a combination of Gauss's method with that of Wild, as M. Wild appears
to do (toe. vit. p. 2). I bsliove that I may claim for my method that it is
an altogether independent one. For the "bifilar galvanic method," out
of which the "bifilar magnetic" has been evolved, is found described, long
before the first of the publications of M. Wild on this subject, and with
account taken of the torsion of the threads, in the third edition of the
Leitfaden der praktischen Physik, 1877, p. 184. The first bifilar-mngnetic
method described by Wild in the year 1881 is, further, altogether different
from miue both in arrangement and in object. Wild's second method is
more nearly like mice, but it was unknown to me, since it was published
later than mine.

               Determination of Moments of Inertia.             453
by means of the well-known relation between the oscillation-
period t, the bifilar directive force, and the moment of inertia
K= —y ; then the body to be investigated is laid in the carrier,
and the moment of inertia of both is determined in the same
way.
   I must refer to my former paper* for the method of deter
mining the directive force 1) from the distance apart, the
length, weight, and elasticity of the suspension-threads, and
the weight of the body, as well as for details of instrumental
adjustment and observation.
   If the body is magnetic, we have to eliminate from the
bifilar direction-force that arising from the earth's magnetism
with the relatively small magnitude of the latter. This is
easily done by arranging that during the oscillations the
magnet shall lie east and west. Or we may bring the sus
pension with the magnet into the meridian, and observe the
oscillation-period tx in the normal position and t3 in the reversed
position of the magnet. Then the oscillation-period of the
unmagnetized body would be
                             n/2
                                          2
    Lastly, the measurement of moment of inertia may be made
before the body is magnetized.
    It is a matter of course that the requisite care should be
bestowed upon the adjustment of the centre of gravity f.
    The oscillations are performed generally very rapidly, much
 more so than one is accustomed to with swinging magnets.
 The observations, however, may be made with the same accu
racy. We simply note the times of reversal on each side, in
 doing which we may, if necessary, omit one or more.
    The accuracy which may be attained is not inferior to that
which may be obtained with slower vibrations. I found the
 results of separate observations, when the oscillation-period
amounted to about 1 second, to agree to within a few ten-
thousandths of a second.
    The moments of inertia of the magnetic bar mentioned
before (16 centim. long, 216 gr. weight) agreed very well
with each other, as well as with that calculated from its
dimensions.
    The following may be mentioned as advantages of the bifilar
mode of determination:—

L. On Hamilton's Quadratic Equation and the general Uni
    lateral Equation in Matrices. By J. J. Sylvester, F.R.S.,
    Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of Oxford^.
IN the Philosophical Magazine of May last I gave a purely
       algebraical method of solving Hamilton's equation in
Quaternions, but did not carry out the calculations to the full
extent that I have since found is desirable. The completed
solution presents some such very beautiful features, that I
think no apology will be required for occupying a short space
of the Magazine with a succinct account of it.
    Hamilton was led to this equation as a means of calculating
a continued fraction in quaternions, and there is every reason
for believing that the Gaussian theory of Quadratic Forms
in the theory of numbers may be extended to quaternions or
 binary matrices, in which case the properties of the equation
 with which I am about to deal will form an essential part of
 such extended theoryj. Let us take a form slightly more
general than that before considered, viz. the form
                            pa? + qx + r=0,
 with the understanding that the determinant of p (if we are
 dealing with matrices), or its tensor if with quaternions, differs

    t Communicated by the Author.
    X I have found, and stated, I believe, in the form of a question in the
 ' Educational Times ' some years ago, that any fraction whose terms are
 real integer quaternions may be expressed as a finite continued fraction,
 the greatest-common-roeasure process being applicable to its two terms,
 provided both their Moduli are not odd multiples of an odd power of 2,
 which can always be guarded against by a previous preparation of the
fraction.

         and the general Unilateral Equation in Matrices.                   455
from zero.       Let us construct the ternary quadratic
                  av? + 2buv + 2cuw + dv1 + 2evio +fv?,
defined as the determinant of up + rq + tor, ou the one suppo
sition, or by means of the equations
        a=Tp\ d=T?l, /=Tr*; b= SpSq-SVpVq,
         c=SpSr-SVpYr,              e=SqSr-SVqVr,
on the other supposition.
    On referring to the article of May, it will be seen that the
solution of the equation may be mado to depend on the roots
 of a cubic equation in the quantity therein called X. When
 fully worked out, this equation will be found to take the
 remarkable form eAn. 1 = 0, where I is the invariant of the
 ternary quadratic above written, and Q. = 2aBc— aSd. It may
 also be shown that
                               (p + b — u)(q — c— u)
                       X=                 2X            '
 where u is a two-valued function of X, and v a linear function
 of u.
     I shall suppose that I, the final term in the equation in \,
 differs from zero: the solution of the given equation in x will
 then be what may be termed regular, and will consist of three
  pairs of actual and determinate roots. When 1 = 0, the solu
  tion ceases to be regular ; some of the roots may disappear
  from the sphere of actuality, or may remain actual but become
  indeterminate, or these two states of things may coexist. The
  first coefficient of the equation in \ is a, the determinant of p
  (or its squared tensor), which also must not be zero, as in
  that case one root at least of X. would be infinite. Let us sup
  pose, then, that neither a nor I vanishes. The very interesting
  question presents itself as to what kind of equalities can arise
  among the three pairs of roots, and what are the conditions
  of such arising.
     This equation admits of an extremely interesting and succinct
  answer as follows:—Let m represent C~^^ ; the equalities
 between the roots of the given equation in x will be com
  pletely governed, and .are definable by the equalities existing
  between those of the biquadratic binary form
                           (a, b,m,e,f)(X, Y)**.
     * If the equation is regarded as one in quaternions, the determining
  biquadratic is the modulus of x2+xp-\-q; from which it follows imme
  diately that, if p, q are real quaternions, all the four roots, say «e, /3, y, 5,

456       Prof. Sylvester on Hamilton's Quadratic Equation
    If the biquadratic has two equal roots, the given quadratic
will have two pairs of equal roots.
   If the biquadratic has two pairs of equal roots, the given
quadratic will have four equal roots.
   If the biquadratic has three equal roots, the quadratic will
have three pairs of equal roots.
   If the biquadratic has all its roots equal, the quadratic will
have all its roots equal.
   In the first case two of the three pairs of roots of the given
quadratic coincide, or merge into a single pair.
   In the second case, not only two pairs merge into one pair,
but the two roots of that pair coincide with one another.
   In the third case the three pairs merge into a single pair.
   In the fourth case the two members of that single pair coin
cide with one another.
   So long as the equation in x remains regular, no kind of
equalities can exist between the roots other than those above
specified.
   For instance, let us consider the possibility of two values
of as, and no more, becoming equal. First, let us inquire
what is the condition to be satisfied in order that the scalar
parts of two roots which belong to the same pair shall become
equal. It may be shown that, the sufficient and necessary
condition that this may take place is that the irreducible sub-
invariaut of degree 3 and weight b' (i. e. the first coefficient of
the irreducible skew-covariant of the associated biquadratic
form [a, b, to, e, f J) shall vanish.
are imaginary. It may be shown that the roots of Hamilton's determining
cubic are
             (»+8)(y+S) j_ (a+yXff+fi)                (* + S)(/3 + y)
        *          4                    4                   4         '
and these therefore are (as shown also by Hamilton) all of them real.
The biquadratic serves to determine the points in which the variable
conic associated to the equation px*+qx+r (i. e. the determinant to
xp+yq+zr) is intersected by the absolute conic xz—y1. Each root of
the given equation corresponds to a side of the complete qup.drilateral
formed by the four points of intersection of these two conies ; and thus we
see that there are five cases to consider when the variable conic is a conic
proper, according as it intersects or touches the fixed conic (which can
nippen in four different ways) ; and seven other cases where the conic
degenerates into two intersecting or two coincident lines (in which cases
the solution becomes irregular) ; viz. the intersecting lines may cut or
touch in one or two points the fixed one, and may cut or touch the conic
at their point of intersection, which gives five cases ; and the coincident
lines may cut or touch the fixed conic, which gives two more. Hence
there are in all twelve principal cases to consider in Hamilton's form of
the Quadratic Equation in Quaternions : or rather thirteen, for the case
of the variable and fixed conic coinciding must not be lost sight of.

         and the general Unilateral Equation in Matrices.             457
    If, now, the vectors as well as the scalars of the two roots are
 to be equal, it may be shown that the second as well as the first
coefficient of the skew-covariant must vanish. But this cannot
happen without the discriminant vanishing*; for it may easily
be seen that the discriminant of a binary biquadratic with its
sign changed is equal to sixteen times the product of the first
and last coefficient, less the product of the second and penul
timate coefficients of its irreducible skew-covariant. Hence
when two roots belonging to the same pair of the given quad
ratic coincide, two values of \ become equal, and therefore all
four roots belonging to two pairs merge into one.
   Again, it is not possible for two roots belonging to two
pairs corresponding to two different values of \ to coincide;
for in such case the expression given for x shows that pq, p,
q, 1 would be connected by a linear equation. But when this
happens (as has been shown by me elsewhere), the invariant
of the associated ternary quartic vanishes and the equation
ceases to be regular. Thus, then, it appears that it is impos
sible for a single relation of equality (and no more) to exist
between the roots of the given equation when its form is
regular. So, again, it may be shown that it is impossible
for four, and no more, relations of equality to exist between
the roots.
   It need hardly be added, that the equation px2 + qx + r = 0
ceases to be regular when q or r vanishes.
   The reader may satisfy himself as to the truth of what has
been alleged as to the relation of the discriminant of a binary
biquadratic to the coefficients of its skew-covariant by simple
verification of the identity
   1 6(a2d - Zabc + 2b3)(e2b - 3edc + 2d3)
         -(a2e + 2abd-9c2a + 6b2c)(e2a + 2edb-9ec2 + 6cPc)
         = %l(ace + 2bcd-c3-b2e-ad2)2 -(ae-ibd + 3c2)3.
   The biquadratic equation in X, Y is what the determinant
of \p + (iq + vr becomes when X*, XY, Y2 are substituted
therein for \, fi, v ; so that we may say that (a, b, m, e,f )(x, l)4
is the determinant of pa? + qr + r, when x is regarded as an
ordinary quantity. ¦ Let <f>x be any quadratic factor of this
biquadratic function in x : I have found that <f>x=0 will be
the identical equation to one of the roots of the given equation
fx = 0, where fx=p.v2 + qx + r.
   Between the two equations fx=Q, <f>x=0, x2 may be elimi-
   * The first two coefficients of the skew-covariant vanishing implies the
existence of two pain of equal roots and vice vend. This is on the
supposition made that a, the first coefficient of the given quartic, is not
lero.

nated and x found in terms of known quantities: <j>x will have
six different values, which will give the six roots of /«=0.
It is far from improbable that a similar solution applies to a
unilateral equation fx=0 of any degree n in matrices of any
order as.
    Call Fa; the determinant of fx when x is regarded as an
ordinary quantity; then, if <f>x is an algebraical factor of the
degree <u in x contained in Fx, it would seem to be in all
probability true that <j>x=0 is the identical equation to
one of the roots of fv=0 ; and, vice versa, that the func
tion identically zero of any such root is a factor of Fx.
By combining the equations fx = 0, <f>x=0, all the powers
of x except the first may be eliminated, and thus every root
of x determined. The solution of the given equation will de
pend upon the solution of an ordinary equation of the degree
na>, and the number of roots will be the number of ways
of combining nto things a> and as together. Thus, for a cubic
                                                                        6'5
equation in quaternions the number of roots would be
or 15. In the May Number of this Magazine it was supposed
to be shown to be 21 ; but it is quite conceivable that this
determination may be erroneous, especially as it was deduced
from general considerations of the degrees of a certain system
of equations without attention being paid to their particular
form, which might very well be such as occasion a fall in the
order of the system. I am strongly inclined, with the new
light I have gained on the subject, to believe that such must
be the case, and that the true number of roots for a unilateral
equation in quaternions of the degree n is 2»2 — n * ; in which
case the theorem above stated, and which may be viewed as a
 marvellous generalization of the already marvellous Hamilton-
 Cayley Theorem of the identical equation, will be undoubtedly
 true tor all values of n and to. But I can only assert posi
 tively at present that it is true for the case of »=1 whatever
 a) may be, and for the case of n = 2, o> = 2 f.
   * From the number 21 above referred to, now known to be erroneous,
the general value was inferred to be n" — if + n, whereas it is demonstrably
2ns— n onlv for the general unilateral equation of degree n in quaternions,
as I proved it to be for the Jerrardian form of that equation.
   t I have since obtained an easy proof of the truth of the conjectural
theorem for all values of n and a ; see the Comptes liendus of the Insti
tute of France for October 20th last.

 LI. Proof of Professor Sylvester's " Third Law of Motion."
                   By Abthtjr Buchheim, M.A*
THE "third law of motion " in the theory of matrices is
       that " the nullity of the product of two matrices is not
less than the greater of their nullities, but not greater than
the sum of the two nullities." Prof. Sylvester has given an
outline of a proof of this theorem (which he regards as
" perhaps the most important in the whole theory of multiple
quantity ") in his lecture " On the three Laws of Motion in
the World of Universal Algebra;" f but I have his authority
for stating that he considers this proof as wanting in sim
plicity, so far as the superior limit is concerned. The instan
taneous proof here given is merely an extension of the proof
given by Clifford for ternary matrices.
   A linear space of (a — 1) dimensions will be called an
a-point : the coordinates of any point of an a-point are linear
functions of the coordinates of a points determining it. A ma
trix A of order n'is considered as operating on the coordinates
of the points of an w-point. Calling the coordinates (xl ...#„),
there are in general n points satisfying the equations A^ . . . xn)
 =X(#1 . . . x„), where X is a scalar : X is one of the latent roots
of A, and the point (a^ . . . x„) is called the latent point apper
taining to X. It follows from known theorems on the solution
 of linear equations, that if A is of nullity a, the , equation
A(.ri . . . #„) =0 is satisfied by all the points of a certain a-point,
 and conversely. I call this a-point the null space of A, and I
 denote it by R : any point of R may be said to be destroyed
 by A. There is also an (n — a)-point S, which I call the space
preserved by A : all the points of the n-point which are not
 destroyed are transformed into points of S : S is, in fact, the
 («— a)-point determined by the latent points appertaining to
 the latent roots that do not vanish.
    Now let B be a matrix of nullity /8 ; let R' be its null space,
 and S' the space preserved by it : then I prove that, if R, S'
 intersect in a 8-point (T), the nullity of AB is # + 8.
    To find the nullity we have only to find the most general
 space (the space of most dimensions) that B transforms into
 T ; for this is obviously the most general space destroyed by
 AB. Now let U be the S-point in S which B transforms
 into T ; then it is easy to see that the most general space
 which B transforms into T will be the (8 -I- /3) -point joining
 (U, R'). From this it follows that the most general space
 destroyed by AB is a (8 + /3)-point—that is, that the nullity

of AB is /3 + S. If R, S' do not intersect at all, the most
general space destroyed by AB is obviously R'; and the nullity
of AB is therefore $.
     We have now to distinguish cases: I assume a + /S<«,
which gives a<re— y8. An a-point and an («— /9)-point in
the same ra-point will in general intersect in an (a— /3)-point:
therefore if a < /3, R, S' will not intersect at all, but may cut
in anything up to an a-point. If a > /S they may intersect in
anything from an (a — /S)-point to an a-point. We therefore
have the following theorem :—Let A, B be two matrices of
nullities a, yS respectively: then, if a</S, the nullity of AB
is in general /3, but may be anything from a to a 4- 0 inclusive;
if a >/?, the nullity of AB is in general a, but may be anything
from a up to a + /S inclusive.

Geology of Wisconsin. Survey of1873-79. Vol. IV. Accompanied
    by an Atlas of Maps. Large 8vo, pages xxiv & 779. With
    numerous maps, plans, plates, and woodcuts. [Madison.] 1882.
rPHlS handsome, well-stored, and richly illustrated volume of
      the Wisconsin Geological Survey Reports is a worthy successor
to the Volumes II. and III., already noticed in the Philosophical
Magazine for April 1880 and September 1882. It is divided
into nine Parts, being reports and memoirs by members of the
Survey and other competent workers.
    In Part I. (pages 1-98) Moses Strong gives the " Geology of the
Mississippi region north of the Wisconsin Eiver :" noting, first
(pp. 3-6), the field-work in general, during 1873-0; then (pp. 7-36),
the Physical Geography and Surface-Geology of the district, accord
ing to the Townships in their order; thirdly (pp. 38-98), the
 local Geological Formations are described. These stand thus : —

   The lithological and other characteristics of each formation are
duly described, together with the economic products, fossils, and
places where they are found. The artesian wells and mineral
springs of Sparta, Oil-City, La Crosse, Prairie-du-Chien, Jordan,
and the water-supply from the Potsdam Formation,—also the
Drift and Boulders of the great river-valleys, and the Caves and
" Sinks " are especially described.
   Part II. (pp. 99-159), by Mr. L. C. Wooster, is a description of
the " Lower St.-Croix District." Under " General Geology" we find
an account of :—(1) the exposure of the Archsean rocks, as a granite
at Chippewa Falls ; (2) the Potsdam Group, as the Eau-Claire
Grit, the Eau-Claire Trilobite-beds, the Hudson Trilobite-beds
with the variable Lower and Upper Calcareous Bands ; (3) the
Lower Magnesian Limestone ; (4) St.-Peter's Sandstone ; (5) the
Trenton Limestone. The Quaternary formations and their his
tory form an interesting chapter here. The " Hydrology " and
the " Vegetation " of the district succeed. The latter comprises
the following classes :—1. Prairie and terrace group. 2. Oak and
Poplar group. 3. Hardwood and Conifer group. 4. Pine group.
5. Grass and Sedge group.          6. Tamarac group. The mutual
relations of vegetation, soil, rainfall, and subjacent rock arc here
treated of ; and the nature of the soils, peat, brick-earth, &c, is
the subject of Chapter VI.
   Part III. (pp. 161-349) is a comprehensive account, by Prof.
R. P. Whitfield, of the most prominent and characteristic Fossils
discovered at different times in Wisconsin, with a general view of
the Paheontology of the State, and detailed descriptions of some
new fossils. The illustrations consist of 27 good plates. These
are species from the Potsdam Sandstone, the Lower Magnesian
Limestone, the Trenton- and more particularly the Galena-lime
stone, and Hudson-River and Niagara Groups, and the Guelph
Limestone, and from the Lower Helderberg and the Hamilton
(Devonian) Groups. An important Appendix (pp. 350-363) gives
a general list of the Fossils hitherto recognized as occurring in the
State of Wisconsin, with their respective. Geological formations.
   Prof. T. C. Chamberlin, the Chief Geologist of the State Survey,
has supplied Part IV., fully descriptive of the " Ore-deposits of
South-western Wisconsin " (pages 367-568), noticing previous
accounts and theories by Owen, Whitney, Murrish, and others, and
entering carefully into the subject, with remarks on the nature
of the minerals concerned and the grouping of the ores, thus :—
I. Minerals in the form first deposited, as galenite, sphalerite,
pyrite, marcasite, chalcopyrite, manganese, sulphide, caleite, dolo
mite, quartz, and barite. II. Secondary Minerals—sulphur, melan-
terite or copperas, alum, hematite, lemonite or yellow ochre,
siderite, cerussite (lead-carbonate), anglesite (lead-sulphate), smith-
sonite, hydrozincite, goslarite, malachite, azurite, gypsum, and
pyrolusite. The areas and special distribution of the ores, the
strata containing them, and the local conditions of those strata,
the aspect and characters of the lodes, the relations of the ores

 462                Notices respecting New Books.
 to the strata and to each other, and their changes, are all carefully
 treated, and well illustrated with more than 60 cuts, besides maps.
 The theoretical deductions as to the origin of the ores occupy
 Chapter II. of this Part. The hypotheses of sublimation and of
 thermal waters being objected to, the theory of oceanic deposition
 and formation from the containing strata is treated in detail, and
 illustrated by a highly suggestive map of the probable " Silurian
 Interior Sea,'' with its currents and islands. Practical considera
 tions follow, as to prospecting and mining ; and an Appendix gives
 some particulars as to the statistics of Copper-production at Mineral
 Point.
    Part V. (pages 573-581) consists of an account of the " Quart-
 zites of Barron and Chippewa Counties," compiled from the notes
 of Messrs. Strong, Sweet, Brotherton, and Chamberlin.
    Part VI. (pages 583-61 5), by F. H. King, on the Geology of the
 Upper Flambeau Valley, comprises the unfinished work of the late
 Mr. Moses Strong ; and, though full of excellent detail, is rather
 a report of progress than a complete monograph, the river-courses
 alone having been examined in the limited period of Survey. The
 Archaean (Laurentian) rocks are here exposed as granites, gneisses,
 mica-schists, hornblende-schists, and other old rocks ; somegrana-
 tiferous *, others with chlorite, kyanite, staurotide, tourmaline,
quartz, magnetite, &c. The hydrology, topography, glacial features
(scorings, kettles, drift-ridges, till, boulders, <&c.), soil, and vege
tation of the district are duly considered ; and a microscopical
examination of the Archaean rocks, by R. D. Irving, is added
(pp. 616-621).
    Pages 623-714 contain Part VII., treating of the " Crystalline
 Rocks of the Wisconsin Valley," by R. D. Irving and C. R.
 Vanhise. In vol. ii. these rocks were briefly described as far as
then observed ; further field-work by members of the Survey has
extended the Geological Map and increased the collections. The
results are here shown in one general Geological Map and eight
sketch-maps of successive portions of the valley, with accompany
ing notes. A tabulation of the results of Mr. Vanhise's micro
scopic study of the crystalline rocks of each of these districts
supplies the number of the specimen t, a reference to the pages in
vol. ii., the name of the rock and of the place, the number of the
Land-section, the Town, and the Range on the Sketch-map, the
macroscopic description of the rock, and its constituents as deter
mined by the microscope. Granites (hornblendic, augitic, &c),
   * The use of the base word " garnetiferous " in the Report is as bad
as the other bastard word " diamondiferous," in circulation among our
South-African colonists.
   t The stated numbers of tho specimens are the original collection
numbers ; and corresponding specimens " will be found in the Cabinets of
the State University, and of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, and,
loss completely, in those of the Stale Normal Schools, of Beltoit, Racine,
Ripon, and Milton Colleges, and of Lawrence University."

gneisses, granitells, augite-schists, hornblende-schists, chlorite-
schists, mica-schisms, porphyries, olivine-diabases, peridotite, dio-
rites, uralitic gabbros, altered porphyritic diabase, norifces, vein-
quartz, magnetic siliceous schist, argillaceous quartz-schists, and
quartzites, are the chief kinds of rock here treated of. Mr. Irving's
"summary of results" (pp. 712-714), as to the local extent and
the relationships of these great schistose masses, of Huronian
and probably Laurentian ages, with their associated eruptive rocks,
is concise and useful. He says in conclusion :—" Mr. Vanhise's study
shows now that angite, so far from being a stranger to such rocks
as gneiss and granite, is nearly as common a constituent, so far
at least as this region is concerned, as hornblende or mica, and
that all the hornblende of the rocks of this region is but altered
augite. My own examinations of many hundred sections of the
eruptive rocks of the Copper-bearing Series of Lake Superior have
convinced me that in those rocks also there is no hornblende that
 is not secondary ; and, while I am not at all prepared to say
that there is no such thing as original hornblende in the older
 crystalline rocks, I am sure that there is far less of it than has
 heretofore been supposed. Many diorites are, thus, but uralitic
 or altered diabases and gabbros ; while many sjenites, hornblende-
 granites, hornblende-gneisses, and hornblende-schists are also but
 altered augitic rocks. The existence of this wide-spread alteration,
 and of another equally important one, which I have elsewhere
  shown to obtain widely in the rocks of the Lake- Superior region,
  namely, the substitution of secondary quartz for primary felspars,
 makes it very evident to me that any one attempting to solve the
  problem of the origin of the crystalline schists must give much
  attention to the matter of internal alterations and replacements."
     Part VIII. (pp. 715-723), based on the observations of Mr. A. C.
  Clarke, and edited by the Chief Geologist, Prof. T. C. Chamberlin,
  is a succinct notice of the "Superficial Geology of the Upper
  Wisconsin Valley;" treating of its glaciation, the valley-flood-
  deposits, earlier glacial deposits, morainic accumulations, boulder-
  clay or till of the Second
  soils, and native vegetation.
     Part IX. (pp. 725-754) is a concise account of the " Geological
  Survey," being a " sketch of the geodetic work done in the State
  since 1874, under the auspices of the United-States Coast and
  Geodetic Survey, together with a short outline of the principles
  and methods pursued in the triangulation, accompanied by two
  maps, one showing the triangulation executed and proposed, and
  the other the difference between the positions of the trigonometrical
   stations as given by ordinary surveys and the same in their true
   position on the Spheroid." By John E. Davies, Professor of
  Physics in the University of Wisconsin, and Chief of the Geodetic
   Survey in Wisconsin. With an Appendix by C. A. Schott, Chief
   of the Computing Division of the LT. S. Geod. Survey, on " the
   measurement and resulting length of the secondary base-line near
   Spring-green, Sauk County, Wisconsin, in 1878."

of the " Lead-bearing Crevices " of the Lead-region, and two
illustrating the Triangulation of the Geodetic Survey.
   An Index to the Palaeontology, and a general index to the
volume, complete this large and valuable addition to geological
knowledge, not only useful to the citizens of the State where it
has been produced, but welcome to geologists all over the world.
An Elementary Treatise on Conic Sections. By Charles Smith,
   MJL. London : Macmillan and Co. 1883. (Pp. xi+352.)
An Elementary Treatise on Solid Geometry. Same Author and
   Publishers. 1884. (Pp. xv+230.)
We have read this second edition of the ' Conies ' as carefully as
we read the first, and rise from the perusal with an enhanced
opinion of its suitability as a text-book for College and School
Students, in fact for all who wish to get an accurate and extensive
acquaintance with this branch of mathematics. The text is very
lucidly written, all the useful properties of the sections are clearly
put, and the reader gets a full insight into the elegances of a very
fascinating subject. Few students will need to carry their investi
gations further ; and if they do require to advance, they will find
Mr. Smith's book a capital preparation for such advanced treatises
as that by Dr. Salmon.
   The text, we may further remark, is very free from typogra
phical errors ; nor have we noted any mistakes of moment in the
numerous exercises, many of which we have had occasion to work
out. An inaccurately drawn figure which had place in the first
edition is now replaced by an accurately drawn one. In addition
to careful revision numerous additions have been made, more
especially to the chapter on Involution, and to the final one on
Reciprocal Polars and Projections.
   Inspirited by the success of his first venture, Mr. Smith has
ventured to send forth a second work, viz. one on Solid Geometry.
We have formed much the same opinion on this work as we have
expressed above : it appears to us to be written on the same
lines and to possess the same good qualities. It is a very good
elementary text-book, and can, we believe, be safely recommended
as fit for the purpose for which the author has written it. The
usual parts, of a large subject, which are considered as elementary
are discussed in twelve chapters ; and the only novelty in detail is
perhaps the very early stage at which the discussion of the different
surfaces represented by the general equation of the second degree
(quadrics) takes place. We consider that this discussion is well
done, and not at all likely to be too difficult for the beginner to
master.
   There are numerous exercises, worked out and unworked, and
theorems due to Chasles and others are established. We commend
the 'Solid Geometry' as a fitting sequel and complement to
the ' Conies.'

An Elementary Treatise on the Differential Calculus, containing the
    theory of Plane Curves, with numerous examples. By Benjamin
    Williamson, M.A., F.R.S. London : Longmans. 1884. (Pp.
    xvi + 454.)
Mb. "Williamson's works certainly meet the wants of a large
class of students. His treatise on the Integral Calculus has reached
a fourth edition, and the present work, an elder child, is now in its
fifth edition. As time rolls on, so come the announcements of a
new edition of one or the other work ; and, as with the human
offspring so with these, increase of age brings increase in size and
knowledge. Mr. Williamson does not rest satisfied with so much
good work achieved, but his motto is " onward,"' and so of the
present treatise we can say " vires acquirit eundo."
    Our author is ever careful to inform his readers that his book is
principally intended for the use of beginners, but we fancy that in
time he will leave little untouched that may concern the most
advanced students. It would be now out of place to discuss such
a work as this, upon which the world of mathematical students has
stamped so clearly its " Imprimatur." It is for us only to wish
"more power" to the able author, and trust that he will meet
with like success in those new pastures in which, we learn, he is
now expatiating—we allude to his forthcoming treatise on Dynamics.
    We may note that the chapter on Boulettes and on the Enve
lope of any Curve carried by a rolling Curve is put more shipshape
 than in some of the earlier editions ; that there is a full account of
the Cartesian oval, a direction in which our author has done much
 good work ; and, to crown all, the " latest novelty " is a short
 account of the Determinant functions yclept Jacobians—of which
we expect to hear more in the ' Dynamics.' We wish Mr. William
 son's treatise a " bon voyage."

 DETERMINATION OF THE WAVE-LENGTHS OF THE PRINCIPAL
     LINES AND BANDS IN THE INFRA-RED PORTION OF THE SOLAR
     SPECTRUM. NOTE BY M. HENRI BECQUEREL.
 TN a recent communication to the Academie des Sciences* on the
 ¦*- lines in the infra-red part of the spectrum formed by incan
descent metallic vapours, I had occasion to point out some correc
tions which I had been led to make in the numbers adopted in a
previous researcht for the wave-lengths of several lines and bands
in the solar spectrum. I now give a resume of my new determina
tions of the wave-lengths of the principal lines and bands in the
infra-red portion of the solar spectrum.

to the extreme end of the visible part, shows, among other things,
big absorption-bands. The two more-refrangible ones have already
been split up into groups of bands and very fine lines ; and it is
probable that a more complete investigation would lead to a similar
result for the two others. In my former researches I indicated
these bands, starting from A, by the letters A', A", A"', and A,T.
   The bands A', A", A'" appear to have been observed by most
physicists who have examined the infra-red region of the solar spec
trum by thermoscopic methods, notably by J. Herschel, Fizeau and
Foucault, Desains, and Lamansky. The same bands were observed
by my father in 1860 by applying methods relating to phospho
rescence ; but the values (varying considerably among themselves)
which different physicists have obtained for the wave-lengths of
these rays do not allow of the identification, with any certainty, of
the results of their researches. In 1847 Fizeau gave the number
0-001445 millim. for the wave-length of a band which appears to
bo the band A'". On the other hand, my father obtained for this
same band, by the phosphorographic method, numbers varying
between 0-001400 and 0-001200 millim., and gave the number
0-001220 millim. for its most-refrangible border. It was therefore
necessary to determine these wave-lengths directly by using a
grating.
   In 1879 Capt. Abney prepared a very beautiful map of the infra
red portion of the normal spectrum ; it was obtained by photo
graphy, and extended to about the wave-length 0-000980* millim.
In my previous researches I was enabled, by the application of
phosphorescence, to measure, in the diffraction-spectrum of a gra
ting, to about 0-001000 millim. ; but the feeble brilliancy of the
spectra did not permit of my going further, and I adopted the
number 0-001220 millim. for the most-refrangible border of the
band A'" which can be easily observed in the spectrum formed by a
prism. The numbers above 0-001000 millim., published in the paper
cited above, were obtained by means of an interpolation based upon
this assumption.
   In a memoir published in 1883 Mr. Langley deduces the wave
lengths of the bands A', A", A'", AIT from their position in the
spectrum formed by a prism by an ingenious method of graduation
of his spectrobolometer ; and the numbers obtained by him, starting
from 0-001000 millim., differed considerably from those given by
our hypothetical interpolation. I then proposed to make these
determinations again, by throwing the diffraction-spectra obtained
by a grating on phosphorescent substances considerably more sen
sible for infra-red rays than those which were at my disposal during
my former researches. These substances have allowed of my mea
suring, with a sufficiently near approximation, the wave-lengths
of the bands in question, as well as several of the finer lines ; the
numbers given by these experiments are near enough to those ob
tained by Mr. Langley with his bolometer, but the delicacy of the
method of observation used by me is much greater.
   The solar rays, concentrated upon a Tiarrow slit, in the focus of a

              Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.           467
collimator were made to fall upon a beautiful grating, ruled on
metal by Mr. Kutherfurd, which M. Mascart was kind enough to
lend me. The rays, brought to convergence by a lens, then tra
versed a bisulphide-of-carbon prism, of which the edges were at
right angles to those of the slit and the lines of the grating, and
formed upon the phosphorescent substance a series of oblique
spectra, in which the rays of spectra of different orders were in
juxtaposition and not superposed. The slit was sufficiently narrow
to allow of distinctly seeing the principal lines of the luminous
spectrum ; and on comparing the position of the lines and bands
in the infra-red part of the first spectrum with those of the known
lines in the luminous part of the spectra of second and third order,
their wave-length was obtained with an approximation, which
depended only on the accuracy of the scale-reading.
   The following Table contains the numbers obtained for the prin
cipal lines and bands. These numbers appear exact to within one
or two millimetres, and may be substituted for those which have
been given in the publications of my previous researches.

 mits, when the phosphorescent substances are properly chosen, of
 the investigation of the infra-red part of the spectrum as far as
 thermoscopic and further than chemical methods. This method
 has, further, an advantage that the others do not possess, namely
 that of giving a complete image, at one time, of the part which is

     INVESTIGATIONS ON KADIANT HEAT.         BY H. SCHNEEBELI.
   In vol. lxxxiv. of Poggendorff's Annalen, p. 411 et seqq., Svan-
 berg describes a simple and very sensitive method for investigating
 radiant heat.
   My object in the following experiments was to test the accuracy
and capability of this method, and at the same time to solve experi
 mentally some questions in radiant heat by its means.
   Langley and Baur have in recent times used Svanberg's method
to decide certain questions which present themselves in radiant
heat, and have described arrangements for adapting the method to
the various objects.
   The arrangement which I chose in my experiments is the
 following :—
   A grating of thin tinfoil blackened by platinum chloride and
 enclosed in a box with movable lid formed the resistance to be
irradiated. A Daniell's element was the electromotive force, and
 the mirror-galvanometer in the bridge was adjusted with such
delicacy that a displacement of the contact-key of 1 millirn. pro
duced a deflection of some hundred divisions. The resistance
in the circuit in which was the battery was kept constant by an
intercalated rheochord, and the current-strength was continually
controlled.
   Various circumstances led me to investigate the radiation in the
following manner :—the tinfoil grating was exposed to radiation
for ten seeonds, the current was then closed, and the deflection
read off. The slide was of course so arranged beforehand that, on
closing and opening before the radiation, the needle was at rest.
   There is an evil in the method, which I will at once mention,
that the small current in the bridge never continues for long ; so
that even with a careful protection of the sensitive parts of the
current there is no guarantee that during the ten seconds in which
the radiation continued there is a null current even when the tem
perature of the grating is unaltered. It seemed undesirable to
use a shorter time for radiation, since the temperature of the
grating is a function of the time, and increases very rapidly with
the time, especially in the beginning, and thus slight inaccuracies
in the time of exposure would produce great errors. The fol
lowing numbers show this : —

                 Absorption of Radiant Heat in Glass.
   The absorption of the rays which proceeded from an ignited
platinum foil was first examined in various kinds of glass. The
platinum foil was in the non-luminous flame of a Bunsen's burner.
The glass plates were chosen from pieces of window-glass and of
plates of electrical machines, and had approximately the same
thickness, for only in this case can the absorptions of the various
plates be compared with each other.
   The coefficient of absorption was calculated from the formula
                       J=Joe-^     to h=      t_>
                                            x
in which
   x is the thickness of the absorbing plate,
   J0 the intensity of the incident,
   J that of the transmitted rays.
   The following table gives a representation of the absorption in
the disks chosen :—

    The table shows that the glass plates investigated possess a
 pretty equal absorptive power ; the larger variations which occur
 with No. 4 and No. 5 are easily explained from the different thick
 ness of the two plates. It results from the following that the
 coefficient of absorption greatly decreases with increased thick
 ness.
    The question was further investigated, How is the coefficient of
 absorption altered at various depths of the irradiated layer of
 glass ? The following table elucidates this : I is the thickness of
 the glass plate already traversed before the absorption in the glass
 plate of 1'75 millim. thickness is measured. A luminous gas-
 flame served as a radiating source.

      Investigation of the Radiation of a Swan's Lamp at various
                                 Temperatures.
   The radiation of a small Swan's lamp (resistance when cold 80
ohms) was also determined when heated by currents of various
strengths, from a red heat to a white heat. The currents used were
furnished by a Gramme machine, and were measured by means of
a differential galvanometer for strong currents. The readings were
made by the aid of mirror, scale, and telescope. The numbers in
 the following table give the readings, and therefore the relative
 strengths of the current. At the same time the luminosity of
 the lamp corresponding to the different strengths of current was
 determined. The following tables were thus obtained :—

   Both series show very clearly how enormously the emission of
light increases with increasing temperature.
   The following considerations show that there is a simple relation
between strength of current and total emission. The thermal
equilibrium of the lamp is defined for each strength of current
by the fact that the quantity of heat produced by the current in
the lamp is equal to that given out. Hence for each strength of
current J the following relation holds—
                               PW=C . S,
where
   W is the resistance of the carbon filament at the temperature in
question ;
   S the radiant energy sent out by the lamp ; and
   C a constant.
   From the above equation we get
   If W, the resistance of the carbon filament for the temperatures
here in question (900-1500°), were constant, the quotient must be
a constant,
                                     P
                                      S"
   The following values are obtained for these quotients for the
strengths of currents :—
       J        44-5 48-8 57-0 07O 75 0 88 2 48-0 76-2 94-2
       J'/S... 22-8 24-5 20-7 23-0 22-5 22-4 22-6 22 8 22-6
    Such deviations as occur in two experiments are to be ascribed
 to variations in the current which occur during the observation of
 the total radiation. It follows, therefore, from the table that the
 resistance of the carbon filament from about red heat to white
 heat is, so to speak, independent of the temperature. This seems
to be the case for the coefficient of absorption of the glass globe
of the lamp. T may take the opportunity of remarking that ordi

  ON MB. MOON'S METHOD OF CALCULATING THE RATIO OF THE
                    TWO SPECIFIC HEATS OF GASES.
      To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
      Gentlemen,
   The paper by Mr. Moon in the last number of the Phil. Mag.
(p. 372) is an instructive example of the evil of an indistinct aud
foggy style of writing. Had he set himself to think what was
the real gist of his argument, he could not have failed to per
ceive that his method of calculating y is an old and well-known
one, taught to all junior students of thermodynamics, and first
virtually suggested by Mayer.
   The argument, put concisely but quite fully, is as follows : —
More energy is needed to warm gas at constant pressure than at
constant volume, because of the work doue in expanding. Equating
the extra energy expended per gramme of gas to the external
work done (as Joule and Thomson have entitled us to do), we get
                           3(c'—c)dT=pdv;
but the fundamental property of a gas, pv=HT, combined with
the fact that the above change of volume occurred under constant
 pressure, gives
                               pdv=~RdT,
whence                            ,      R
                                 c — c=y.

    Putting into this equation the numerical values selected by
                              c'
 Mr. Moon for e', J, and B,        will come out equal to 1-41095, as he
correctly reckons.             c
    Any one referring to Mr. Moon's paper will perceive how
 elaborately he has involved this simple matter until it has become
 laborious to disentangle Ins meaning.
    The difficulty of reading and appreciating what is good and new
 in work would be greatly diminished if authors would more fre
 quently take pains to express themselves as clearly and distinctly
 as possible.                           Your obedient servant,

LIV. On the. Changes produced in the Molecular Condition of
    Iron by Heating to Redness and Cooling. By Carl Fbomme*.
 SOME years ago, upon the publication of some magnetic
        experiments! , I made a short communication upon the
change in density which steel undergoes upon hardening,
and subsequently added to the fuller description % of the same
experiments, in these Annalen, a series of observations made
to determine the distribution of density in the interior of a
hardened steel bar. The general applicability of one of the
former results has recently been called in question by obser
vations of H. Meyer§. These observations show an increase
in density upon hardening for one ("drawn soft bright steel")
of three kinds of steel examined, whilst the other two kinds
(" best bright English cast steel " and "polished English steel")
showed the decrease which alone I had observed ||. I have
therefore made new experiments upon these phenomena of
change of density upon hardening, and endeavoured to obtain
a nearer insight into the reasons of these phenomena by ex
tending the observations to the different modifications of iron,
from pure electrolytic iron free from carbon to the more highly
carbonaceous cast iron.
     The question of the distribution of density in a hardened
steel bar had been far from solved by the single series of obser-

474     M. Fromme on the Changes produced in tlie Molecular
vations which I had published ; on the contrary, their result
had been so remarkable and unexpected that further experi
ments were much to be desired. Since I have not in the mean
time become acquainted with investigations on this subject, I
offer now a small contribution to the solution of the question.
   1. On the Change in Density produced by Tempering Iron.
    The following materials were employed :—
    (a) Iron wire 1*4 millim. thick.
    (b) Iron wire 0"5 millim. thick, obtained by drawing out
           the wire (a).
    (c) Iron wire 0-3 millim. thick.
     d) Steel wire 0*7 millim. thick.
     e) Steel wire 0"4 millim. thick, (d) and (e) were from
           the same works in Birmingham, and were called
           " patent steel music-wire."
    (/) Cylindrical steel rod 5*5 millim. thick, 30 millim. long.
    (g) Electrolytic iron in small pieces, deposited from a solu
          tion of ferrous sulphate. Thickness about 0-l millim.
    (A) Electrolytic iron deposited from a solution of ferric
           chloride. Three small pieces were cut from a large
           piece and tested separately. Mean thickness of the
           large piece 0'14 millim.
    (t) Cast iron in the form of a cylinder, 18 millim. long and
           7 millim. thick.
    (k) Cast iron in the form of a plate (20 : 10 : 5 millim.).
    (/) Wrought iron in the form of a cylinder 25 millim. long
           and 5*6 millim. thick,
    (m) White pig-iron in small pieces, such as could be obtained
           from a larger piece by breaking it up with a hammer.
    For determination of' density, a Geissler's pycnometer was
employed, except for (A) and (&), the densities of which were
determined with the hydrostatic balance. The metal was heated
in the flame of the Bunsen burner or in the blowpipe-flame.
    When slow cooling was desired the pieces of metal were
allowed to cool in the bright flame and above it, whilst rapid
cooling was attained by plunging the hot body into water of
10° or 15°. The coating of oxide was removed before each
determination. The wires were examined by cutting off pieces
 suitable to the height of the vessel of the pycnometer, of about
 4 centim. long, and testing a number together (thirty in the
 case of the thinnest wires).
    Each specimen was first heated and cooled slowly, and then
 its density Si measured ; then it was heated again and cooled
 rapidly, and its density 6"r determined. Thus determinations
 of S, and Sr alternated with each other, often repeatedly.

  476    M. Fromme on the Changes produced in the Molecular
     The first point which strikes the eye upon examining this
  table is the decrease, often considerable, which is produced by
  repeated heating, in the density of all the kinds of iron, with
 the single exception of electrolytic iron.
    The exception, presented by pure iron only*, suggests the
 cause of the phenomenon ; it evidently is to be sought in the
 varying proportion of carbon contained in the material which
 will suffer change upon ignition. The total percentage of
 carbon may vary, as well as the proportion between combined
 carbon and graphite. It may be noted that none of the pieces
 were heated longer than necessary. The smallest value of the
 density is then often not reached after repeatedly heating.
 This continuous decrease in density made it necessary to
 combine the determinations suitably, before the question pro
 posed as to the difference in density caused by rapid cooling
 and slow cooling could be answered. I have combined each
 measurement with that preceding and that following it, and
 thus obtained the numbers contained in the fourth column of
 Table I. The intermediate members of the series S( and S,
 have, however, more share in the format ion of these differences
 than the terminal numbers. Nevertheless I have taken the
 simple arithmetical mean of all the differences to three places
 of decimals, since it does not depend upon a knowledge of the
 exact values of 8r— Bt.
    If we now compare with each other the mean values con
 tained in the last column, we find an increase in specific gravity
upon rapid cooling only with the iron wires a and c, the elec
 trolytic iron g, and the wrought iron /. We have, however,
 only one measurement of the electrolytic iron g, and the dif
 ference resulting from it lies within the limit of experimental
 error. For the wrought iron / we have two differential values;
 but they are of small magnitude and of different sign. Hence
 we may conclude that with the electrolytic iron (g) and with
the wrought iron (7) the density is sensibly independent of the
 velocity with which the heated substance cools.
    On the other hand, an increase in specific gravity after
tempering is distinctly observed with the iron wires (a) and
(c), and with the wires (e) it is even considerable.
    All the other substances examined—that is to say, the iron
wires, the steel wires (d) and (<?), the steel bar (/), the elec
trolytic iron (A), the cast iron (grey pig-iron) (t) and (k), and,
lastly, the white pig-iron (m)—all suffered a decrease in specific
   * With the piece A,, on the contrary, the specific gravity increased upon
repeated heating. To begin with, it was decidedly smaller than that of
the other two pieces, but upon repeated heating became continually more
nearly the same.

    Condition of Iron by Heating to Redness and Cooling.       477
gravity upon tempering. This decrease is the greatest in the
case of steel and white cast iron, smaller with the iron wire (e),
and smallest with the cast iron and the electrolytic iron. But
whilst this decrease in density is beyond doubt with all the
kinds of steel examined, the iron wire, and the grey and white
pig-iron, the mean values found for the electrolytic iron must
be received with caution ; since, of the whole fifteen values of
Sr— Si, nine are positive and six negative Hence I consider
it not improbable that a larger number of measurements
(which was not possible on account of the gradual diminution
in the size of the piece) would give a mean value approaching
zero. I therefore regard the existence of a difference in den
sity of electrolytic iron, after slow cooling or rapid cooling, as
not proved. The different varieties of iron are classified, as
we know, according to the quantity of carbon they contain,
which may bo present either in the free condition or chemically
combined ; for the percentage of carbon determines, if not
exclusively yet to a great extent, the properties of any par
ticular kind of iron. Hence I had no doubt that both the
sign and magnitude of the change in density produced by
tempering would be dependent upon the percentage of carbon.
The observations indeed do not contradict this assumption,
but they by no means determine the law of the connexion. It
results from the measurements made with cast iron and with
white pig-iron, that the change in density depends less upon
the total percentage of carbon than upon the quantity of che
mically combined carbon. For in the case of white pig-iron
containing much combined carbon, the change was ten times
as great as with grey pig-iron, in which the carbon was con
tained chiefly as graphite.
   Whilst with white pig-iron and steel (substances containing
the largest percentage of combined carbon) the density dimi
nished upon tempering, it increased with the three kinds of
iron wire examined—substances which contained only a small
percentage of combined carbon. The third kind of iron wire,
obtained by drawing down one of the first two kinds, behaved in
the opposite way; which may possibly be explained by a change
of free carbon into combined carbon, caused by the operation
of drawing. If so, smaller quantities of chemically combined
carbon in iron produce an increase in density, and larger
quantities a decrease, when the red-hot wire is plunged into
cold water.
   This assumption does not appear to be negatived by the
two observations, which alone, so far as I know, have shown
an increase in density of steel upon tempering. For, accord
ing to a table given in Scheerer's Metallurgie, Styrian steel,

478    M. Fromme on the Changes produced in the Molecular
with which Rinmann experimented, contains only a small
quantity of carbon; and the designation of the steel examined
by H. Meyer as " soft " also points to a small percentage of
carbon.
   Whether the view which I have expressed, chiefly by way
of surmise, is correct or not must be decided by more extended
experiments, accompanied by analysis of the kinds of iron
examined.
   Mousson, in his Lehrbuch der Physik, has endeavoured to
explain the change in density produced by tempering as purely
mechanical, assuming that the initial cooling of the exterior
prevents the interior portions from contracting, as they other
wise would do upon the fall of temperature. Hence the
exterior layers arc* left in a condition of forcible compression,
and the interior in a condition of forcible extension. Hence,
according to Mousson, three things would follow :—first,
an increased density and hardness of the superficial layers ;
secondly, a diminished density and hardness of the interior ;
and, thirdly, an increase in volume.
   Let us for the present disregard the first two, and concern
ourselves only with the third result.
   This conclusion is in opposition to the results obtained with
the iron wires (a) and (o), as well as the observations of Rin
mann and Meyer. Any such purely mechanical explanation
of the processes involved in tempering can certainly not be
maintained. But, since Mousson's explanation takes no
account of chemical changes during the process of tempering,
and since it can be shown that such changes occur in iron
containing carbon, it seemed possible that the above explana
tion might at least be applicable to pure iron ; and in fact
pure iron does exhibit on the whole an increase of volume
 upon tempering. But, as already pointed out, the mean
 values obtained cannot be considered decisive upon this point.
 I have further examined platinum, but did not succeed in
 showing any change in volume.
    On this account I am of opinion that a change of volume,
as a result of rapid cooling, only takes place with good con
ductors, such as the metals, if chemical changes occur at the
same time. On the other hand, I do not at all deny the pos
sibility of such changes with substances of small conducting-
power for heat, such as glass.
  2. On the Distribution of Density and Hardness in Tempered
                               Steel.
    I have made experiments upon the distribution of density
and hardness only with one kind of steel, that marked /.

     Condition of Iron by Heating to Redness and Cooling.      479
Before describing these experiments, I wish to mention a few
experiments made with other kinds of iron.
    It is well known that no sharp distinction, depending only
on percentage of carbon, can be drawn between wrought
iron and steel. For the property of hardness characteristic
of steel is dependent not only upon the quantity of carbon,
but also upon the presence of traces of other metals ; so that
iron containing only about 0*5 per cent, of carbon, if it con
tains also other metals as impurities, may be hardened, and
thus behaves like steel. Only when it contains still smaller
quantities of carbon (less than 0-5 percent.) can iron be indis
criminately characterized as soft iron, i. e. it acquires only
slightly increased hardness by being suddenly cooled in cold
water; and this increase is the less the smaller the percentage
of carbon and other foreign substances. This is the usual view,
and Karsten expresses himself to the same effect in his Hand-
buck der Eisenhuttenkunde, when he says, " It is characteristic
of all kinds of bar-iron that their hardness is not perceptibly
increased by being suddenly quenched in cold water."
     My experiments entirely agree with this result : the varie
 ties of iron wire (b) and (c) were found to be distinctly, but
 not considerably, harder after rapid cooling than when slowly
 cooled, since they offered more resistance to flexure. The
 hardness has therefore no connexion with the simultaneous
 change in density, since, whilst the density of (b) decreased,
 that of (c) increased. I was not able to obtain any definite
 result with the iron wire (a) on account of its greater thickness.
 The electrolytic iron was certainly not made harder by sudden
 cooling. Lastly, I have tested the cast iron, as well as the
 brittle white pig-iron, with the file, but without any certain
 result.
     Lastly must be mentioned that platinum and copper do not
 appear to become harder by sudden cooling than by slow
 cooling. It appears, then, that the property possessed by
 metals of being hardened is associated with the commence
  ment of a chemical change, In the case of iron it is chiefly
  carbon, which, when it is present in certain quantities, neither
  too great nor too small, undergoes chemical change upon
  sudden cooling, and is thus the cause of the hardening which
  takes place.
     Five pieces were cut from a cylindrical rod of steel of 0*55
  centim. diameter. Four of these of the same length (about
  3 centim.) were heated and cooled quickly, (a) and (b) in
  water of 45°, (c) and (d) in water of 15°. The fifth piece (e)
  was only 2*3 centim. long. It was made red hot and allowed
  to cool gradually to the temperature of the room. After deter

 480      M. Fromme on the Changes produced in the Molecidar
 mining the densities of the pieces, they were placed in nitric
 acid to which a little hydrochloric acid had been added, .and
 were allowed to be acted upon to a certain extent; then the
 density was determined again ; they were further acted upon
 by the acid; and so on.
      The aqiion took place, on the whole, very regularly: the
 bars retained their cylindrical form and smooth surface; two
  of the pieces showed channels, but of very small depth.
      The hydrostatic balance was employed for the determination
  of density, except that the first ten observations with the
  bar (6) were made with the previously mentioned pyenometer.
  Table II. contains the results of the determination of density,
  together with the absolute weights of the pieces.

      The density of the bar (a) thus remained nearly constant
  throughout the process of dissolving away. It was almost

     Condition of Iron by Heating to Redness and Cooling.      481
always somewhat smaller (at most by 0*007) than at first, and
only reached the initial value three times, t. e. the mean density
of the unattacked and newly tempered bar ; on the average it
was smaller by 0 004. With the bar (b) the density at first
diminished rapidly, then increased, and then gradually sank
with small variations to a constant value, greater than the
initial value.
    With the other two bars (c) and (d), which were cooled
in colder water, the density alternately diminished and in
creased, and the changes took place much in the same way,
a maximum or minimum occurring about the same densities
of the bar. In both cases the density remained lower than
the initial value ; on the average it was about 0*015 less.
    Of these four series of observations the second leads to
very remarkable results. If we calculate the densities of the
layers removed between the first and second observation, and
between the second and third observation, we find the values
 to be 16 and 2. The thickness of each of the two layers
would be about 0*002 millim.
    Although, on account of the smallness of the quantities
 dissolved off, these numbers may be affected by errors of re
 latively large magnitude, yet, unless we suppose gross errors
 of observation to exist, which I do not consider to be pro
 bable, the fact remains that between an external dense layer
 and a central portion of nearly uniform density there existed
 a layer of extraordinarily small density. Apart from this
 peculiar condition of the surface, the distribution of density
 is quite regular—the density decreases until it reaches a con
 stant value. Consequently we have a dense envelope en
 closing a less dense kernel.
    The first series of observations, which relate to a bar tem
 pered in warm water, shows an extraordinarily small difference
 in density. The greatest difference between any two obser
 vations amounts to seven in the third decimal place, which
 may certainly be attributed to accidental want of homogeneity.
 From the fact that the density becomes less upon the whole,
 we may certainly conclude that this bar must have possessed
 a density decreasing, with small variations, from outside
 towards the interior.
     The same conclusion follows from the measurements made
 with the two pieces (c) and (d), which were tempered in cold
  water. With them, however, the difference between the
  density of the exterior layer and the interior is much greater
  than with the bar (a), but the irregularities in the distribution
  of density are also much greater.
     I have calculated the densities of the layers, dissolved away

minimum. Table III. a contains the results of this calculation
for the bar (d), as well as the mean density of the layers
dissolved off up to the observation in question, and the mean

   We find, then, the slowly cooled bar possesses exactly
similar variations in density as that cooled quickly in cold

     Condition of Iron by Heating to Redness and Cooling.    483
water ; whence it follows that they are not produced by the
sudden cooling, but are to be regarded as indicating original
want of homogeneity in the bar.
   A comparison of 82 with B3 shows that the density of the
portion of the bar dissolved away is only twice decidedly
greater than that of the remaining portion. There is there
fore no decrease of density from the surface towards the axis
in the slowly cooled bar.
   The foregoing experiments, taken together, therefore con
firm the common belief that, in consequence of rapid cooling,
a distribution of density results, in which the density decreases
from the outside towards the centre.
   I have so far spoken only of the distribution of density in
a tempered steel bar. According to the usual view, supported
also by Mousson, not only the density, but also the hardness
becomes smaller from the outside towards the centro, so that
a harder shell encloses a softer kernel.
   During the gradual dissolving of the bars by acid, they
were tested with a good file as to their hardness. All four
bars showed themselves so hard through the entire substance
—they were dissolved away so far that the remainder was only
 T5 millim. thick—that they could not be scratched by the
file. The slowly cooled bar, on the contrary, was throughout
very soft.
    Although we must admit the possibility of the tempered
 bar being harder outside than inside, yet the assumption of a
 softer kernel enclosed by a harder shell is not proved, and
 would probably not be found to be the case in all steel bars
 of thickness less than those employed in these experiments.
    Such bars therefore, whether cooled in warm or in cold
 water, must be regarded as homogeneous in respect of hardness.
    It must remain for further experiments to decide whether
 this result holds good for still thicker bars, or how thick tho
 bar may be, so that the interior shall remain soft in spite of
 tempering.
    If we take this result together with that of tho experiments
 upon density, we see that in tempered steel hardness and
 density do not go together, but that smaller hardness may
 correspond to greater density, and vice versa. For, according
 to Table III. A, of seven layers removed from a steel bar four
 possessed a density considerably smaller than the mean density
 of the slowly cooled soft bar, and yet were quite hard. The
 same result is arrived at by observing that the outer layer
 of the bar (e), according to Table III. B, possessed a calculated
 density of 7-93, and yet, in spite of the high density, was
 perfectly soft.

484        Changes in t/ie Molecular Condition of Iron.
   Of the three consequences of a purely mechanical expla
nation of the processes involved in the hardening of steel
by sudden cooling, that which relates to the distribution of
density has been shown to be correct ; the second, concerning
the distribution of hardness, could not be demonstrated abso
lutely, although it is not to be concluded that it may not be
correct for thicker bars ; and the third, which requires an
increase of volume produced by sudden cooling, corresponds, it
is true, to the behaviour of most kinds of steel, but is strikingly
contradicted by the behaviour of other kinds. The mechanical
explanation in question assumes, lastly, a parallelism be
tween density and hardness, since it explains an increase in
hardness by an increase in density. We have seen, however,
that density and hardness by no means increase or decrease
together.
   Hence we arrive at the conclusion that in the tempering of
a steel bar, besides the mechanical, purely physical, process
of sudden contraction, another change also, of chemical nature,
takes place. This consists in a combination between the free
carbon and the iron.
    Barus* arrived at the same result some years ago, by
means of other experiments and considerations. He considers
the combination of carbon as the chief reason of hardness,
which may, however, be somewhat modified by the mechanical
process.
    If, however, we inquire further into the reason of the
combination of the carbon, we easily see that the reason can
only be sought in the mechanical process, which appears then
as the primary cause of hardening. It appears to me that
it is essentially great pressures, produced by the sudden con
traction of the red-hot steel plunged into cold water, which
bring about the combination of the carbon and the iron.
    This same idea has been already expressed in a paper pub
lished twenty years ago by Caronf. Experiments are there
described which are concerned with the behaviour of suddenly
cooled .steel, of hammered steel, and of slowly cooled steel
when treated with acids. The result obtained was that the
residue of carbon was inappreciable in the first case, more
considerable in the second case, and largest in the third case.
Caron concludes from this that the steel hardened by sudden
cooling contained its carbon almost altogether chemically, and
that the change produced in the most complete manner by
sudden cooling may be, partially at least, brought about by
            • Wied. Ann. vii. p. 383 (1879).

hammering. The reason of the combination of the carbon
would, however, be the same in both cases—namely, the closer
approximation of the molecules produced by pressure ; and the
smaller effect produced by hammering is explained by the
fact that, in the first place, upon hammering the approxima
tion takes place in one direction only, but upon cooling in
all directions at once, and that, secondly, the pressures exerted
are less intense than those produced by cooling.
    If this view of the cause of the hardening of steel produced
by sudden cooling be correct, it must also be possible to
harden steel by allowing it to cool slowly from the red-hot
condition, but so that during the cooling it is exposed to high
pressure. Steel thus treated ought, then, like tempered steel,
to contain more combined carbon, and to be hard. In fact,
according to Cl(5mandot * and Lan t, both of these conclusions
are verified by experiment.

ample, as the principal points, or nodal points ; and they may

   3. From similar triangles PFX, XF'P', it is immediately
seen that
                            ff'=dd',
where FF = d, PF' = <f.
   If the rule of signs (§ 1) be applied to the measurement of
d, d' on the two axes, it is to be observed that they are of the
same sign, both being negative, for example, in fig. 1.
   4. If P, P' are conjugate points, as also Q, Q', then drawing
 PXP' QXQ', as in fig. 1, we have
                   dd' = (d + PQ)(d'-B'<X),
which reduces at once to
                           PQ T P'Q'
This is of the form
                             i+i>=i->
where the distances d, D are measured from P, and d', D'

            of Refraction at one or more SpJierical Surfaces.        487
   from its conjugate P', the rule of signs being that already
   referred to (§ 1).
       5. Fig. 2 exhibits the construction adapted to formula (2).
    P in one axis coincides with its conjugate P' in the other, and
   the line joining any other two conjugate points Q, Q' on the
   two axes passes through the point (d, d').
       If the origin be the self-conjugate point 0, the centre of
   the sphere, the relation (2) becomes
                                P    P
   where (fig. 3)
                            0F=/',   OP=p, &c.
   As in § 3, we have
                                  dd'=f'f.
       6. In the following proposition, which, in the form given,
    is due to Helmholtz (vide Optique Pkysiologique, p. 72), I have
    changed his notation and employed the rule of signs (§ 1), in
    order to exhibit the result of the elimination in a symmetrical
    form.
       Let there be any number of spherical refracting surfaces
    whose principal foci are (Fj, F'x), (F2, F'3), &c, and which
    cut the common principal axis in A, B, C, . . . Let (IL, Rj),
    (R1; Rj) ... be pairs of conjugate points such that RoFi = d0,
    RiFi-d'i, ... In like manner let (P0, P,), (P„ P2) . . . be
    any other set of conjugate points, such that RoPn = Pa,
    R^A.... Then, by §4,
                                Po    Pi
                                ^ + ^=l,&c.
                                Pi F*
    Also by the rule of signs (§ 1) we have px = —p\, pt= —p'2, • • •
    Hence, on eliminating these quantities, the position of P„, the
    point conjugate to P0 with reference to the system, is deter
    mined from an equation of the form
                                ^ + 4=1,                              (3)

   7. The construction of § 5 (fig. 2) applies to equation (3) ;
and from the figure we at once deduce, as in § § 3 and 4, the
general relations for any system
                     dd'=ff,    B + ^=l-
The latter, it may be observed, also follows from (3), since
Eo, R„ are any conjugate points.
   8. The principal foci F, F' of a system of two surfaces Si, S,
constituting a lens may be found as follows:—
   Let (F„ F',), (F3, F2) be the principal foci of Sj and S2,
which cut the principal axis in A, B respectively, so that
AF1=/„ AF,=/„ ... In fic. 4 take the point X, (/„/',)
referred to A, and Xs (ft,f'i) referred to B. Then, since
parallel rays on emergence from the system come from F2,
F2 is the image of F in        Therefore the line joining Xi and
F2 on the y axis will cut the x axis in F.
   Again, since parallel rays on incidence go to F'j and thence
to Fr, F' is the image of F\ in S2. Therefore the line joining
X2 and F'i on the x axis will give F' on the y axis.
   The principal foci of any system of surfaces may be deter
mined in like manner.
   9. In the case of a lens the distances AF, BF' may be
readily found as follows in terms of fs, . . .
   From the similar triangles FAF2, XjF'jFj (fig. 4), we have
           AF _ F'jXj ,        . J^F _          fx
           AF2 - FxF; ; tMt 18 h-e ~f\ +/,-«¦
where AB=e.
   Also from the similar triangles F'BF'i, X2F2F'i,
           BF'     F2X2             BF' _        /',
           BF, =          that "'/V^ ~7Wi-«"
   These values can also be deduced from the relation of § 3.
Thus, taking the x axis of the figure, wo have
                     FiF.F'iF, =/,/'„ Ac.

   In like manner,
                 ?t =      =     &c-
   From these relations we find

points Ro, B« the principal points of the system. Thus, if

   11. Now let R, R' be the principal points, F, F' the prin
cipal foci of a thick lens ; so that we have

   12. Conjugate points will be nodal points N, N' when
on the x axis we have NN' = RR'. This will evidently
happen when (fig. 6) the line through X makes FN=FX.
RN( =/'—/) on the x axis will then be equal to R'N' on the
y axis.
   If distances are measured from the nodal points N, N',
equation (4) becomes^—   f +p f =1, in which /', p are mea
sured from N, and /, p' from N'; and the conjugate points
are determined as in fig. 7.

   13. These figures make the existence of self-conjugate points
manifest. Thus in fig. 7, if S is such a point, we have
              FS.F'S =//', FS + FS=FF'=2/t.
   Hence FS, F'S are the roots of s2-2/ts+// = 0; and the
self-conjugate points are at equal distances from F, F'.
   14. Fig. 8 exhibits the construction when one of the self-
conjugate points is taken as origin.
   From the similar triangles PFP, S'FX, and also PSP,
FSF, we obtain the relations
                    PSF _ PP _ PP _ SP
                     S'P -S'X~FF_SF"
   15. If F is the image of K, and K' of F', then on the praxis
of fig. 8 we have, § 7,
               FK . FF' = FS . F'S=FF'. FK'.
   Hence
                        FK=FK/=-^.
   Also, if T, T' are conjugates such that FT = F'T', then
                        FT"2=FT. F"F=/f.
   It thus appears that the middle point of FF' also bisects the
lines KK', SB', RN', R'N, TT' and (vide § 28) W.
   16. Helmholtz's method (§ 6) may be applied as follows to
a system of lenses.
   Let thero be any number of lenses L1; L2, . . . whose prin
cipal foci are (F1} F'j), (F2, F'2) . . ., and whose principal
planes cut the common axis in (A, A'), (B, B') . . .
   Let (Ro, Pti), (Ri, Rj) ... be pairs of conjugate points such
that R0F1 = Boj RiF'i=B'ij RiF2=Bi, ... In like manner let
(P0, Pj), (Pj, P2), ... be any otber set of conjugate points
such that RoP0=p0, R1P1=^/i, . . .
   Then, § 7,

from which, by eliminating px = —p\, />2 = —p't, . . . , we get
an equation of the form

where f^R^F,/' = RnF'; F, F' being the principal foci of the
system.

   17. The principal foci F, F' of a system of lenses may be
determined geometrically as in § 8.
   Thus, let there be two lenses L1} L2, whose principal foci
are (F„ F',), (F2, F'2), and principal points (Rj, R^), (R2, R'2).
Then (fig. 9), since parallel rays on emergence come from F2,
F2 is the image of F in Lj. Hence the line joining Xx and
F2 on the y axis gives F on the x axis. Again, since parallel
rays on incidence go to F'i, and thence to F', F' is the image
of F\ in L2. Hence the line joining X2 and F\ on the x axis
gives F' on the y axis.
   In the construction, of course, any pairs of conjugate points
may be employed instead of the principal points.
   18. In the system of § 16 the images tou t»2, . . . which an
object to0 at Rq produces may be determined as follows:—
  Let             (fi,f'i), ... be the principal focal lengths of
Lj, L2, . .. Then since (§ 20) in a thick lens the ratio of the
object to the image is that of their respective distances from
the nodal points, we have (fig. 10),
                wi.N'iRi. FiX_/x Jh\
  In like manner we have
                       ft         d'2

  19. The equation for the system of lenses being ^f +•'—      f = \}
referred to the principal points, the corresponding equation,
when the nodal points are origins, becomes f                f = 1, in

conjugate points may now be compared.

     22. If to at S gives to' at S, then (fig. 7) from the similar

                        to' ~ N'S ~ SF ~ / "

      24. The geometrical method of the preceding sections may
  also be extended to the case of reflection at one or more
  spherical surfaces. A few examples will suffice to illustrate
  the method. Thus, for a convex mirror F and F' are coin-

                            P     P
 Hence the line joining conjugate points on the two axes
 passes through X(—/,/), as in fig. 11.
     For a concave mirror the formula is
                           /_/_,
                           P P       '
 and Xis (/, —/), as in fig. 12.
     25. In either case we have, from the similar triangles
 PFX, XFP' (fig. 11 or 12),
                             PF _ FX
                             FX ~ PF';
 that is
                              M=f\
 which is Newton's formula.
     If d and d' be measured from P and P' in accordance
 with the rule of signs § 1, this formula should be written
                            dd'=-f,
 as also appears bv deducing it from the relation dd'=ff
 of § 3.
     26. The relation between the lengths of the object and
 image is most readily obtained by making the axes cross at 0,
 the centre of the mirror.
    Thus, for a convex mirror we have (fig. 13)
                       to' _ OF _ FX _ /
                       to ~ OP ~ PF ~ d'
    In the case either of a convex or a concave mirror it may
 be remarked that, if account be taken of the signs of/,/',
d, d', the relation
                             tO   d ~f
determines whether the imago is erect or inverted, the sign of
to'
— being positive in the former case, and negative in the latter.
                                III.
    27. Since writing the above, it has occurred to me that the
relation dd'=ff leads to two other simple geometrical methods
for exhibiting the relations between the conjugate points.
    Thus, if we separate the two axes FF', FF' so that F in the

494    Supposed Repulsion between Magnetic Lines of Force.
x axis coincides with F' in the y axis, as in fig. 14, then evi
dently the feet of the ordinates drawn from any point on the
hyperbola xy=ff will be conjugate to one another. This
construction gives us a readier means of finding many of the
points whose positions have already been discussed.
   Thus self-conjugate points are at once given by
                         x(2h-x)=ff;
 and the points K, K' (§ 15) by
                         2hx=/f.
   Again, H being the middle point of FF', if H is the image
 of G, and J of H, we have
                         F'J=-^' = 2FK=FG.
                                A
    28. From the construction of the preceding section it appears
 that the lines joining pairs of conjugate points on the two
 axes touch the hyperbola
    Fig. 14 shows that the conjugate points V, V are equidistant
 from H, the middle point of FF', and that
                      FV = F'V'=FT=V//'.
 LVI. On the supposed Repulsion between Magnetic Lines of
    Force. By R. H. M. Bosanquet, St. John's College,
    Oxford-.
   To the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine and Journal.
       Gentlemen,
 THE idea of a repulsion between magnetic lines of force
       was derived by Faraday from the repulsion which exists
 between two magnetic needles placed " side by side with like
 poles in the same direction " (Exp. Res. vol. iii. p. 419).
    In the deduction of the forces which accompany lines of
 force, Maxwell reduces them to a tension along the lines of
 force combined with a pressure in all directions at right angles
 to them.
    Now it is easy to show experimentally, and indeed it is well
 known, that rings magnetized by means of a continuous coil
 uniformly wound round them present no external magnetic
 action, though they may be the seat of closed circuits of mag
 netic lines of force of very great intensity. It is clear that in
 this case we may suppose the ring divided into a number of
 separate rings, each containing lines of force, and that such

   Some Thermal and Volume Clianges attending Mixture.            495
 rings will be wholly without action on one another. If, then,
 such similar rings be placed parallel and close to each other,
 they do not repel each other, as they should do if there existed
 a repulsion between parallel lines of force.
    Practically, it is impossible to obtain rings so uniformly
 forged and wound as to be entirely without external magnetic
 action. This usually manifests itself as a slight polarity, which
 is easily recognized by a compass-needle, the poles being at
 the extremities of a diameter. But in my rings this polarity
 has always been small, even when the induction in the ring
 was 10,000 or thereabouts. I have suspended two such rings
 parallel to each other by strings, and made the contacts by
 the ends of the coils dipping into mercury. But neither by
 reversing the magnetism of the rings relatively to each other,
 nor by make and break have I ever been able to cause the
 smallest movement of the nature of approach or recess of the
 rings with reference to each other.; and this was only to be
 expected from what is well known.
    We may notice that, in the illustration of Faraday, the
 movement of the system of two parallel needles due to their
 repulsion leads to a redistribution of the lines of force. It
appears therefore that the repulsion here observed must depend
 upon this redistribution. To illustrate what is meant, suppose
 the lines of force to exert their tension like elastic bands on a
 mechanical system such that, when yielding to the tension
 takes place, the needles are separated. In this case, whenever
the lines of force are prevented from changing their form, the
repulsion at right angles to them must disappear ; and this
appears to be what actually happens.
LVII. On Home Thermal and Volume Changes attending
              Mixture. By Frederick Guthrie *.
   [The paragraphs are numbered in sequence with those of my previous
communications on Salt-Solutions and Attached Water.]
§ 256. TT may be taken as a rule that solid crystalloids are
         JL more soluble in liquids when the two are at a
higher than when at a lower temperature. The apparent
exceptions to this rule are all, I believe, referable to the de
composition by heat which the solids undergo and the inferior
solubility of the new products in the liquid.
   In §§ 238-241 a it was shown that the liquids triethylamine
and water are remarkably more miscible when cooler than
when warmer ; and their relationship in this respect was
  * Communicated by the Physical Society. Read November 8, 1884.

496          Frederick Guthrie on some Thermal and
pretty fully made out. The conclusion come to in this par
ticular case was that, when the two liquids are brought
together, a subcryohydrate is formed, and the heat attending
(set free during) its formation may or may not be sufficient
to effect its almost complete decomposition, or, rather, mitigate
its formation according as the initial temperature of the two
liquids is higher or lower. And that subsequent elevation of
temperature affects decomposition. Depression of temperature
promotes the formation of the subcryohydrate.
   A liquid is in a different predicament from a solid when
 the question turns upon the solubility in a liquid medium.
 With a solid, increase of temperature always tends in the
 direction of fusion per se, which implies diminished cohesion
 and the bringing of the two (solid and liquid) into a com
 munity of physical state. In the case of two liquids, although,
 as before, rise of temperature may promote solution by di
 minishing cohesion, such promotion may be more than coun
 terbalanced by the tendency of the increased heat to separate
 one or other liquid as a vapour, the particles of which,
 coalescing, form a liquid insoluble in the rest.
    Be this as it may, it will be found that the separation of
 liquids from their mixtures by increase of temperature is by
 no means uncommon, and may be the rule rather than the
 exception long before temperatures approaching the critical
 ones are reached.
    § 257. Change of Volume of Triethylamine and Water at
 about the Temperature of their Separation.—The remarkable
 separation which takes place between triethylamine and water
 when a mixture of the two is warmed, and which was de
 scribed in § 238, suggests the possible use of such a mixture
 as a calorimeter. For, if such separation is accompanied by
 any great change in volume, since the amount of additional
 heat required to effect a large separation is exceedingly small,
 a very exact measure of the heat given to the mixture by a
 given mass of matter cooling through a given range of tem
 perature would be obtained by measuring such change of
 volume.
    I accordingly took a bulb with a capillary stem and deter
 mined its capacity up to a lower mark on the stem, and then
 calibrated the stem. The capacity at 16°-1 was 9-1823 cubic
 centim. The mean volume of 1 millim. of the stem was
 •000830038 cubic centim., or 0-00009039 of the capacity of the
 bulb. Into this bulb 5*4873 grams of water were introduced
 and then 3*0600 grams of triethylamine, making a 35-8-per
 cent, solution. The two on being mixed and brought to the
 temperature of 160,1 had a volume which may be called V,

for an hour at each 0o,5 higher temperature. In the follow

    The original volume at 160,1 being 9*1820 cubic centim.,
 at, for example, 19°-1 it was 9-182 + 72-1 x '00083001 *, or
9'2418 cubic centim. As the volumes in the third column
are corrected for calibre, they serve at once to explain the
 behaviour of the liquid.
    From § 237 it seems that the liquid here dealt with is, at
starting, at 16°"1 a mixture of the suboyohydrate and the
 base itself. This mixture expands regularly from 16°*1 to
 17°-6. Through that range equal increments of temperature
are accompanied by equal expansions. At 180-1 the liquid
is opalescent, and that opalescence is accompanied by an in
creased expansion. At 180-6 the liquid becomes quite milky,
and on standing separates into two of nearly the same density
and refractive index. These two are about equal in volume (see
 § 241 a). The two next half-degree warmings produce a still
greater separation ; I mean that the total actual sinking of
the watery solution and the rise of the ammoniacal solution is
 probably greater in this case than before. The joint expan
sion has increased. Now this may be brought about by two
 causes : either that the separation is greater, or that after
separation the mean expansion by heat of the separated parts
                       * from table of calibration.

 498         Frederick Guthrie on some Thermal and
together is greater. That                         Fitr. 1 .
the increased expansion
is not due to the second
of these causes seems
proved by the fact that,
as the heating is con
 tinued, the expansion—
 although, indeed, always
 greater than that at
 temperatures below the
 separating point—is less
 than the expansion du
 ring separation. Sepa
 ration produces some ex
 pansion ; and this being
 superadded to the ex
 pansion due to the in
 creased temperature of
 the separated constitu
 ents gives rise to the
 elegant curve of fig. 1.
 The lower and upper
 parts of this curve are
 straight lines at different
 inclinations to the axis.
 The region of separation
 is indicated by a curve
 tangent to both, and
 whose mean tangent is
more inclined than either
 to the axis ofpercentage.
    Although, therefore,
the separation of the
mixed liquids into two
immiscible liquids (each
of which is mixed) is
accompanied by an ab
normal volume-change
(increase), this increase
isnotsomuch larger than
the increase attributable
to mere heat^dilatation as
to make the liquid even
at the brink of its critical
condition especially va
luable as a calorimeter.

   Another resource would be of course to measure the degree
of separation approximately by measuring the height of the
plane of separation of the two immiscible mixed liquids heated
fry a known mass cooling through a known range. This
would be indeed in theory a very effective calorimeter; but I
do not see the way at present to overcome certain practical
difficulties of arrangement and manipulation.
   § 258. Diethylamine and Water.—These two liquids appear
to mix in all proportions at all atmospheric temperatures
above 0° C. An aqueous solution of the base, when heated
in an open vessel, gives off the base as a vapour, and the
temperature does not rise above 100° C.
   Into a strong glass tube, which was afterwards sealed, was
introduced a mixture consisting of 45*42 per cent, of diethyl-
amine and 54-58 per cent, of water. On heating this in an
oil-bath, with a thermometer, very gradually, and again letting
the temperature fall slowly, the bath being kept well stirred,
the following changes were observed :—
   At 1 30° the liquid was still quite clear.
       134°*5 separation was incipient.
       135°. The lower layer amounted to about £ of the whole.

    The conditions were not such as to allow of exact measure
ment. The critical temperature is, however, trustworthy ;
and the result shows that, within a range of about 10° C. only,
the separation begins and is completed, as far as the com
pletion is faithfully measured by the height of the plane of
demarcation. It is to be noted that, owing in part to the re
fractive index of diethylamine being nearer that of water
than is the refractive index of triethylamine, the above sepa
ration is not marked by the milkiness which characterizes the
separation of the latter body *. If it were not for accidental
dust-particles floating on the surface of the lower liquid it
would be, in some cases, almost impossible to distinguish the
two layers. As the phenomenon of separation is one which
   * Mr. Illingworth, a student in my physical laboratory, hai been kind
enough to determine the refractive indices of this group.

    A few points are noticeable in these experiments. The
 12-64-per-cent. solution showed no true separation at 180°.
 On standing to cool, with the point of the tube a little above
 the oil, a layer was formed on the liquid surface of about
 1 millim. in thickness. This layer subsisted even when the
 temperature of the bath had sunk to 100°, provided the tube
 was not shaken. On repeating the experiment, and removing
 the tube from the bath at 180°, it became evident that the
 phenomenon was one of distillation. The upper and partly
 empty end of the tube being the first to cool, the liquid
 of highest vapour-tension, namely the diethylamine, distilled

               Volume Changes attending Mixture.              501
into that region, condensed, and floated on the heavier and
more aqueous portion. Such a layer is rather apt to be over
looked, but its growth may be watched in comfort after the
temperature has fairly begun to sink.
    § 259. It should also be remarked that while a 12-64-
per-cent. solution at 180° has only a slight etching-action on
glass, the 62*35-per-cent. solution caused the surface of the
glass (soft German) to peal off in visible scales when heated
to 150°-1 60°, acting like a caustic alkali. This may be the
 reason of the bursting of the 75*76-per-cent. tube, which had
a wall-thickness of 2'5 millim. and an internal diameter of
 9 millim. It is well to remember, therefore, that a tube
 which has withstood a pressure due to a certain temperature
 may afterwards give way when even at a lower one.
    § 260. I have not succeeded in separating ethylamine from
 water by heat in closed vessels. But by the closest analogy
 we must expect both that body and ammonia itself to leave
 the water with which they are combined as subcryohydrates
 (§§ 235, 233); and at some very high temperature and pres
 sure to exhibit nearly complete insolubility with that liquid.
 All of these liquids contract with water and evolve heat.
     § 261. Tetrethylammonium Oxide.—Looking on aqueous
 ammonia as being a solution in water of the oxide NH4 HO, the
 comparison between ethyl-, diethyl-, and trietbyl-ammonium
 oxides on the one hand, and tetrethyl-ammonium oxide on
 the other, in regard to their solubilities in water being affected
 by heat, should present many points of interest both to the
 physicist and to the chemist. The following experiment may
 be noted ; for although it brings us but little further in the
 immediate direction of our inquiry, it confirms the statement
  that a solution of tetrethylammonium is decomposed on con
  centration by evaporation. A 10-per-cent. solution heated in
  an oil-bath to 180° gives off a permanent gas which ultimately
  may burst the tube. This is no doubt olefiant gas. At the
  same time oily drops which float are formed in the tube;
  on cooling, they disappear. This is evidently triethylamine
  containing water; the reaction being
            (C3 H6)4, NHO= (C3 H6)3, HNHO + C, H4.
  And it appears that this known decomposition is brought
  about by heat alone without concentration.
     § 262. Tetramethylammonium Oxide (a 10-per-cent. solu
  tion) does not show any separation at 200°, but begins to
  solidify at —16°. The tetrethyl compound of the same
  strength also solidifies in an ice-salt cryogen.
     § 263. Ethylic Ether may be here mentioned as a liquid
  which, though only slightly soluble in water, forms with it a

 502         Frederick Guthrie on some Thermal and
 solution decomposable by heat. Water saturated with ether
 at a given temperature, and heated in a closed tube a few
 degrees, becomes visibly milky. When such a solution is
 heated to 100° C, the ether, probably nearly anhydrous, forms
 a distinct layer on the top. It is redissolved on cooling. Now
 in § 104 it was shown that ether united with water. In
 § 274 it will be shown that such union is accompanied by the
 liberation of heat and by contraction. Here we have the
 third term of such relationship, namely, the decomposition of
 the combination by a rise of temperature.
    § 264. Alcohol and Bisulphide of Carbon.—It may be
recalled that in §§ 207-228 strong, almost perfect, analogies
were established between water-salt alloys and salt-salt alloys.
 So, now, I am led to consider the case of the mixture of two
liquids neither of which is water. And in choosing for my
first experiments alcohol and bisulphide of carbon, I was
guided by the fact that, speaking from a chemical point of
view, we should not expect there to be any relationship, and
because both liquids can be got in a state of very great purity.
The alcohol was obtained by distilling the nominally " ab
solute " from quicklime. The bisulphide was washed with
water and distilled from oil of vitriol. A
preliminary experiment showed that expan              Fig. 3,
sion resulted on mixing the two. A quill-
tube about 4 feet long was closed at one end
and half filled with the bisulphide ; about an
equal volume of alcohol was added. The
tube was closed and the contents mixed.
When the whole had resumed the air-tempera
ture, a permanent lengthening of the column
of about 11 millim. had taken place.
     For exact determination the following
method was employed. Two bulbs, A and B,
nearly equal, were blown on a piece of ther
mometer-tubing of rather large bore (about
1 millim. internal diameter), the neck be
tween the bulbs having the same width and
being as short as practicable; the bulbs being
weighed, bisulphide was introduced through
a very fine capillary tube, until the lower
bulb was filled at 17°-6. The whole was
again weighed. The upper bulb and the
lower part of the stem being filled with
alcohol, the height / was noted at which the
liquid stood at 170,6. A third weighing
followed. On tilting and frequently inverting, the two could

   This gives an expansion of 0-007405 of the original joint
volume. The method is seen to be one capable of extreme
accuracy, and is, I think, though more laborious, preferable
to a specific-gravity method, because the temperature is better
under control. This individual result has, however, no
special numerical significance, because the two liquids are
not in any simple relationship by weight or volume, and
because, as we should expect and as we shall see is the case
(§ 271), the ratio of change of volume depends upon the ratio
of the constituents.
   It is important to note that the increase in volume here
observed is accompanied by a fall in temperature, which at
first, and until the temperature is recovered, tends to reduce
the volume. This, the natural corollary of expansion, will be
examined later.
   § 265. Alcohol and bisulphide of carbon mix with one
another in all proportions at all temperatures between 0° and
 100° C. This fact does not seem to be generally known,
the reason perhaps being that a very small quantity of water
prevents the perfect mixture taking place between some pro
portions of the nominal constituents. The examination of the
simultaneous reciprocal solubilities of the three bodies alcohol,
bisulphide, and water would be a fascinating inquiry, but a
 very onerous one; for many thousand experiments would
have to be performed in order to trace the effect of even a
 few variations in temperature and in the threefold ratio.
 Moreover, the complication would be much further increased
 by the chemical attitude between alcohol and water.
    § 266. I made nine mixtures of alcohol and bisulphide con
 taining the two liquids in different ratios. The liquids were
 weighed in tubes closed at one end, and having capillary necks,
which were then sealed off. These solutions, when used,
were transferred to open tubes, which were then cooled in an
ordinary ice-salt cryogen with the following results.

   In these experiments, as the thermometer sinks it is noticed
that at several degrees above that at which separation begins
the liquid becomes opalescent, or rather fluorescent ; for in
this state it is still perfectly transparent, and colours the
transmitted light of a light orange -yellow. It is pale blue by
the fluoresced light. On reaching the critical temperature of
true turbidity, the change is abrupt. At only the fraction of
a degree lower the liquid divides into two with surprising sud
denness and precision. In the case of the 79-96-per-cent.
mixture the volumes of the two separated liquids are about
equal at —17°, although at —15° only the above-mentioned
fluorescence betrays the impending change. The suddenness
of the change argues that the quantity of heat lost during the
change is inconsiderable. Again, on removing from the
freezing-mixture and shaking up, I have not been able to
detect anything like a stationary thermometer during remix-
ture, although all analogy shows that there must be a tendency
that way. Indeed the phenomenon closely resembles that
described in § § 238-241a attending the decomposition of an
aqueous solution of triethylamine. But it is here presented
with a falling thermometer, there with a rising one. Here it
resembles the separation of a solid salt containing water of
crystallization from an aqueous solution which still retains
some : there it was due to the decomposition by heat of a
subcryohydrate. Here the original mixing absorbed heat, as
when a salt dissolves in water : there it liberated heat. Here
such mixing gained volume: there it lost volume. The one
case is, as it were, a real image of the other, and inverted,
because real.
   Only such a little bit of this behaviour is revealed by an
ice-salt cryogen that it would be almost useless to draw its
curve from these four points. Laid out in percentages of

    § 267. Perhaps we may take the relationship between
alcohol and bisulphide of carbon as being typical of such a
relationship as resembles the solution of nitre in water, or of
fused nitre in fused nitrate of sodium (§ 220) (which results
 in expansion of the solidified alloy), or, lastly, the solubility
 of fused nitre in water under pressure (§ 252) . The method
of experimenting adopted reveals, however, somewhat unex
pected relationships between other liquids,
which relationships are of a more chemical
 character. Many chemists have of late years
 made great use of the term " saturation," and
 the expression has been of some real service.
 But its unguarded use has, I venture to say,
 given rise to some misconception. The word
 itself certainly conveys something absolute
and complete; and it is undoubtedly intended
to convey such an idea, especially when pre
fixed by " perfect " or contrasted" with " par
 tial." It is only necessary to revert to the
 types of physical saturation upon which the
 analogies of chemical saturation are based, to
 show that such condition is relative and not
 absolute. Chemical saturation is not a remote
analogue of electric neutrality, and the latter
 is clearly relative.
    § 2(58. Two or three tubes were made,
similar in principle to that of fig. 3, but of
more general use (fig. 4). In one of these
the lower and upper bulbs (up to a subse
quently marked point on the stem) were of
absolutely the same capacity (between 3 and
4 cub. cent.). In the second the lower bulb
was several times as big as the upper. By
adding weighed quantities of mercury to the
lower bulb, the ratio of contents could be
changed at will.
    In order to give an idea of the absolute
and relative dimensions, I may state that
in one of the tubes the exact capacity of
a and bf at 170,6 was 3'3777 c. c, the total volume upon

    lary tube about / was 0*00140183 c. c; so that 1 millim. on
   the capillary meant 0'00020737 of the joint liquid volumes.
   As the readings could be made by means of a cathetometer* to
   within 0'2 millim., I imagine that the numerical results are
    strict to the fifth decimal place. The only other sources of
   error appear to be the mixing of the liquids during the filling
    of the upper bulb and capillary. The filling of both bulbs is
   effected by means of a funnel-capillary, which reaches about
   half way down into the bulb which has to be filled. Acci
   dental soiling of the tube is removed by a thin German-silver
   cotton-covered wire.
       In the following Table equal volumes at 17°'6 of the liquids
    enumerated were taken. There is in every case an expansion
    marked +, or a contraction marked — . Before these signs
    is H, C, or according as heat is liberated or absorbed. Imme
    diately beneath these signs is the amount of contraction upon
    one volume of the original liquids taken jointly (before mix

    volume has to be brought in order to restore it to the original

(1) the diffusion during the second filling of the two liquids
against gravity, an operation which lasts about 15 minutes,
and (2) the imperfect purity of the substances. The first of
these is quite negligible, as the common surface is only about
1 square millimetre, while the volumes are over 3 cubic centi
metres.
    In taking the tube out of its bath it is tilted, bulb upwards,
so as to be at an angle of about 45°. Where the differences
of refractive index and of density are great, complete mixture
seems to be reached in five or six reversals of a few minutes
each *.       But in none of the cases given above wore the
reversals less than 20 in number nor of less duration than 10
minutes each, nor was the manipulation stopped before trial
showed that constancy of volume had been reached. Each
experiment from first to last takes about five hours. The open
end of the capillary may be stopped by a short piece of caout
chouc-tubing containing a glass plug.
    § 269. Returning to Table LXL, a cloud of ideas suggest
themselves. The results are obtained on equal volumes at an
arbitrary temperature 170-6 both before and after mixture.
Wherever there is gain of volume, there is absorption of heat,
cold, diminished heat-tension (C). Wherever there is loss of
volume, there is liberation of heat, heating, increased heat-
tension "(H). These thermal effects are only given qualita
tively in the Table, and were actually obtained in a second
series of experiments made as follows. Equal volumes of the
two liquids were run from burettes into two test-tubes of thin
glass, one of about twice the capacity of the other. The nar
 rower was put inside the wider, and both put into water at
 17°*6. After sufficient standing, a thermometer in the inner
liquid marks nearly the same temperature. The tubes are
 removed from the water and wiped, the inner one broken
 through at the bottom and used as a stirrer.
     Let us consider, now, two of these cases more exactly, in
 one of which there is heat and contraction, in the other cold
 and expansion.
    * In making such experiments as these, the question presents itself—
 If two colourless (or similarly coloured) liquids have the same refractive
 index, how shall we know whether they are mixed or not ? And if,
 therewith, they have the same density, how does their emulsion differ
 at all from their mixture ? It is, indeed, unlikely that any two liquids
 have the same refractive indices or the same density at more than one
 temperature. And that they should have both refractive index and density
 alike at more than one temperature involves an improbability of a higher
 order. Apart from this, however, it is likely that the skin of a liquid has
 a different (higher) densitv and a higher refractive index than the mass of
 the same liquid. (F. G., Phil. Mag. November 1883.)

  As we are here merely searching for a maximum, we may
neglect certain effects which would be of the utmost import
ance under other circumstances. Thus the specific heat of
none of the liquids is the same, and each rise of temperature
given is weighted with the specific heat of the liquid in which

 it takes place. But I believe I am right in assuming that
 this effect would not in this instance materially shift the place
 of the maximum, although it would alter every one of the
 individual numbers, and that not in the same proportion.
    The curve, fig. 5, shows tho relationship of increased heat-
 tension to the proportions of chloroform and ether by weight
 by which it is caused.
    From these six experiments, therefore, we find that the
 greatest change (rise) of temperature takes place when the
 liquids are in the proportion of 1 ether to 1 -615 of chloroform
 by weight, which is the proportion of C^H^O to CHClj.
    § 271. This method of experimentation, however, does not
 allow of such great accuracy as the method of change of
 volume. If it be found that the greatest change of volume
 takes place when these weight-ratios (1 ether to 1-615 of chlo
 roform) are mixed, and that a very small change of ratio
 either way diminishes the change of volume, this evidence
 will be much strengthened towards the conclusion that the
 relationship is indeed between molecule and molecule.
    Taking, therefore, the tube like A (fig. 3), having equal
 bulbs of 3*2325 c. c, I put 9*304 grams of mercury into the
 lower bulb. This reduced the capacity of the lower bulb
 0*693 c. c, bringing it to 2-5390, the upper bulb by 3-2325.
They are in the ratio of l-380 to 1*084, which, again, are in
the ratio of the molecular volumes (molecular weights divided
by specific gravities) of the two liquids. The ratio-value of the
capacity of the calibrated capillary-stem has now, of course,
to be taken upon a lesser total volume—namely, upon 5*7715
instead of upon 6*4650. The first quantities of chloroform
added should be shaken and warmed with the mercury, so as
to displace the film of air between the mercury and the glass,
or some dissolved gas. If this is not done before the other is
added, air-bubbles arise when the two are mixed, and vitiate
the readings.
   The result for equimolecular volume at 17°*6 is 0*0116756:
chloroform 1, ether 1*2731.
    Instead of 9*304, 1 now introduced only 9*0 grams of mer
cury ; this reduced the lower bulb 2*5699 c. c, and the two
together to 5*8024; the volume-ratio between the two being
1 chloroform to 1*258 ether. The shrinkage on the new
volume was 0*0114783.
   Next I introduced 9*6 grams of mercury. This reduced
the lower bulb to 2*5241 c. c, and the two together to 5*7566.
The volume-ratio between the two is now 1 chloroform to
1*2806 ether.      The shrinkage on the new volume was
0*015706.

close to, if not at, the monomolecular ratio ; thus confirming

    The liquid solidifies to a white crystalline mass at a constant
temperature below 0°, which I shall give when I have deter
mined it exactly.

        Vapour-tension of Chloroform and Ether Mixtures.
    § 272. The result of the experiments given above will make
 it imperative to revise previous ideas about the vapour-tension
 of mixed liquids. The following experiments with ether and
 chloroform show how the vapour-tension varies with the com
 position. The al isol i! tely pure and dry substances were mixed in
 various proportions by weight, and each mixture was introduced
 into one of a series of perfect barometers in a room of uniform
 temperature. The barometers stood in the same trough close
 together. The readings were made with a cathetometer at a
 distance of nine feet. The readings were made backwards
 and forwards through the series three times. The atmospheric
 pressure was made constant by adjusting the mercury in the
 trough. About five grams of the liquid were introduced into
 each tube, and in all cases enough, as shown by a rough mea
 surement and calculation, to ensure there being far more than
 sufficient of each kind of liquid to supersaturate. After deter
 mining the mercurial depression, the liquid columns above the
 mercury were measured, and their specific gravities assumed
 to be those due to mixture without change of volume. This
 is not quite true (see § 2(!8). Further, it is assumed that the
 liquid has th; same composition before as after its introduc

    § 273. The increase of vapour-tension as the proportion of
 ether increases is therefore continuous, but by no means
 regular. There is in the neighbourhood of the monomolecular
 ratio a diminution in the rate of increase ; but immediately
 this region is past, the curve becomes rectilinear. As the
 barometer-tubes stand side by side in a row, they present a very
interesting appearance, as the mercurial levels form a curve
closely similar to that in fig. 6, A (p. 515) turned upside down.
 Guided by heat-development and shrinkage, we have there
fore detected the existence of C4H10O, CHC13, and showed that
the vapour-tension confirmed the existence of this bod}'. Are
we, then, to assume that in every case in Table LXl. where
there is heat-development and shrinkage, there is also true
chemical union ? Reluctant as some may be to admit to the
title of chemical compounds a class of bodies which probably
numbers many thousands, there seems no help for it. There
can be but little doubt, for instance, that ether unites with
alcohol and benzol, that chloroform unites with alcohol and with
amylene, and so on. The experiments necessary for the proof
of this assertion will be laborious, and will require such care
and concentration that I must again invite other workers into
this fertile field. There is, however, one point which may be
here noted. Two elements may unite to complete saturation
in respect of one another, yet the molecules so formed may

512           Frederick Guthrie on some Thermal and
be quite prepared to unite as a whole with another atom or
molecule (compare § 207).
   § 274. The contraction ;md heating attending the mixing
of alcohol and water have been long known. W hen, in § 98,
I described the solid combination of the two, C2II60, 4ILO,
and called it a, cryohydrate (I should now call it a sub-
cryohydrate), I did not suppose that it was only one of so
numerous a family as appears to be the case. In § 104 was
briefly described a combination of ether with water. I may
here mention the circumstance that equal volumes of the two,
when shaken together at 17°"1, rise in temperature to 180,9.
Equal volumes brought together at 17°-6 in the experimental
tube of § 268, and agitated by a globule of mercury being
made to pass to and fro through the capillary opening, con
tract 0-0()5436 of their joint volume, and require to be
heated to regain that volume. This contraction is probably
very far from the maximum, as there is no doubt a large
quantity of passive matter present. For the same reason,
the maximum liberation of heat will probably be found with
a less water-ratio.         Where the maximum heat-liberation
occurs we should look for the subcryohj'drate, and there also
for the maximum contraction.

   § 276. Laid out graphically we get accordingly the curve B,
fig. 6. Perhaps the most notable character of this curve is
its descent at the upper right end. This means that, although
bisulphide of carbon has a lower vapour-tension than ether, a
little bisulphide loosens the ether and raises the vapour-tension.
The effect on the vapour-tension of the liquid brought about
by the addition of a little ether to the bisulphide is much more
marked.

   § 277. Referring again to Table LXI. it is seen that, with
whatever of the liquids there examined bisulphide of carbon
is mixed, expansion occurs and the temperature is lowered.
With chloroform these results are very marked ; and having
examined the relationship between bisulphide and ether and
between chloroform and ether, let me describe the relationship

    The result seems, then, to be this : The vapour-tension of
bisulphide of carbon at 16°-0 is 264- 8 millim., at 13°-8 it is
251/6 millim., both referred to mercury at those temperatures.
Of chloroform the vapour-tensions at these two temperatures,
also referred to mercury at the same temperature, are 1 f59-2
and 158"4. A very great increase of the vapour-tension is
brought about by mixing a very little bisulphide with the
chloroform ; a little rise is brought about by mixing a little
chloroform with the bisulphide. The graphic interpretations
of the two Tables LXVI. a and LXVI. b are shown in curves
C and D, fig. 6.
    § 271). If we could find two liquids showing neither con
traction nor expansion when mixed, and neither liberating
nor absorbing heat, the vapour-tension of a mixture of such
liquids should be expressed by the equation
                     vt(M+nt)-vta+          ma + nf)      ,
where generally vt, means the vapour-tension of the liquid s,
and where a and b are the liquids and m and n their respective

 516         Frederick Guthrie on some Thermal and
 masses. The vapour-tension curve would be a straight line
joining the vapour-tensions of the constituents. The maximum
 departure from this straight line on the curves in fig. 6 gives
 us the maximum interference. This, in the case of chloroform
 and ether, is at the monomolecular ratio. Now, if we search
 the curve of mixtures containing bisulphide of carbon, we find
 there also a maximum departure from the mean at a certain
 ratio. In the case of bisulphide of carbon and ether this is at
 30 or 35 per cent, of the ether (say 32'5). This implies that
 the maximum departure from the mean takes place where
 1 molecule of ether (C4H10O) is mixed with 2'02 molecules
 (say 2 molecules) of CS2. At this ratio we may suppose
 there to be no indifferent or inert matter. If we consider
 chemical union to be due to an action of attraction, and regard
 the maximum thermal or volume effects as taking place when
 there is no superfluity of either constituent, so here we have an
 equally distinct molecular ratio, and an absolutely definite one
 (at all events at a given temperature), where a sort of anti
 union takes place—a maximum effect of repulsion. This is a
 state of things for which some new nomenclature may be
 necessary. There may be as many anticombinations as
 there are combinations ; and the former may be quite as
 definite in weight-ratio as the latter. The essential difference
is that, while attraction may result in the production of new
stuffs, the latter has the locally opposite action.
    Again, with chloroform and bisulphide the maximum de
parture from the mean is at 40 per cent, bisulphide. This
signifies 1 molecule chloroform to 1'05 molecule bisulphide.
I therefore submit these formulae—

   What is the relative nature of the bodies which should give
a straight line on the vapour-tension curve of their various
mixtures? Such may probably be found amongst hydro
carbons. I find that when equal volumes of ethylic and
amylic alcohols are mixed at 130,9, the temperature rises to
150,1, implying the formation of a species of double alcohol.
Referring to Table LXI. (§ 268) and to the few representative
bodies there considered, we find that amylene and alcohol
are almost without volume-change.

LVIIT. Applications of Molius's Theorem on the Reversion of
    certain Series. By J. W. L. Glaisher, ALA., F.R.S.*
                          Definitions fyc, §§ 1, 2.
§ 1. rpHROUGHOUT this paper the letters a,b,c, ... are
       X        used to denote prime numbers only.
   I. The operator En is defined by the equation
                               E./00 =/(*"),
viz. the effect of operating with E» upon any function of x is
to convert it into the same function of an. This definition
is supposed to hold good for all values of n, positive or
negative, integral or fractional.
   Since
                      E«/(*")=/(*"m)=Enm/(*),
we see that
                         EnxEm=EBm=EmxE.
universally, so that, if n = a" b*cy . . . , then
                          e„=e:xe?xej. . .
   II. The quantities ea, «», ee, . . . (in which the suffixes are
primes) are supposed to be absolutely independent constants ;
and by e^ we denote ea x e\, by eat we denote ea x ea — eat, and
in general, if n—aab^cy. . . , then en is defined to denote
0u X X €g • • •
   It is perhaps most convenient to regard, as in this defini
tion, ea, f», ec, . . . as arbitrary quantities merely distinguished
from each other by the suffixes a, b, c, . . . ; but if we regard
them as functions of a, b, c, . . . respectively, it is to be
noticed that they are independent and arbitrary functions of
a, b, c, . . .', viz. we have
                   ea=<f>(a), eb=y(b), ec = x(e), &c-
   § 2. In order that we may have ?„ = <£(n) for all values
of n, the function <f) must be such that <f>(mn) =<p(m)<f>(n),
whence <j>{n)=nr.
   Unless, therefore,
                        e<t=ar, eb=br, ec = cr, . . .
(where r may have any value whatever), en cannot be the
same function of n for all values of n.

             =W(*")j
where « has all values of the form aab^cy .... The value of «i
is supposed to be unity.
    Now from the given equation we have
/(*) = (1-*E.)(1-*E,)(1-*E.) ••• F(«)
         =F(x)-2e.F(a») + Se«»F(«rt)-2«rt.F(«-«)+. . .
         =2±«»F(x"),
 where « has all values of the forms a, ab, abc, . . . and the
 sign is positive or negative according as the number of factors
 is even or uneven.
     We thus obtain the theorem:
     If a, b, c, . . . be any prime numbers, and if
           ^                 F(«)-S*/v*").
 where the values of n are all the numbers of the form a'bPc* . .,
 that is, all the numbers which have all their prime factors
 included among a, b, c, . . ., then
                          /»=S(-l/e„F(*»),
 where the values of n are all the numbers of the forms
 a, ab, abc, . . ., that is, all the numbers which have all their
 prime factors included among a, b, c, ... and which are
 divisible by no squared factor, and r denotes the number of
 the prime factors of n.
     This is the most general form of the theorem published by
  Mobius in Orelle's Journal, vol. ix. pp. 105-123*. The
          • " Ueber eine besondere Art von Umkehrung der Reihen."

520            Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher on Applications of
mode of proof is different, as Mobius obtained his results by
equating coefficients, and without the use of symbolic methods.
In his paper Mobius first proves several particular cases of
the theorem, but his results are practically of the same
generality as the theorem given above.
   If the number of primes a, b, c, . . . be finite, the number
of values to be assigned to n is infinite in the first equation,
but finite in the second equation. If the number of primes
a, b, c, . . . be infinite both series extend to infinity.
                 Particular Cases of the Theorem, § 4.
   § 4. The most important cases of the theorem are (i.) when
a, b, c, . . . denote the complete system of prime numbers, and
(ii.) when they denote the complete system of uneven prime
numbers.
   (i.) Putting
                         a = 2, 6 = 3, c=5, ...
and
                        <?2 = 2r, «3 = 3', es = 5r, ...
bo that e„ = nr(§2), we obtain the result:—
   If
     F(x) =/(*) + */(*») + b"f{j*) + Vfi**) + 5r/(^) + &c.,
then
      /(jr) = F(x)-2'F(x2)-3'F(^) -5'F(.r*) + 6'F(.rs)
                - 7rF(x7) + KTF (x10) - 1 l'F (a:11) + &c.
In the first series all the natural numbers occur ; in the
second only those numbers which are divisible by no squared
factor.
    (ii.) Putting
                           a=3, b = 5, c»7, ...
and en=nr as before, we find:—
If
  F (*)=/(.*) + 37V) + 57V) + 7W) +                        &c.,
then
      / (*) = F0r) -3'F V -5'F(*») -7'F(*T) -ll'F(*")
               -13'FV3) + 15rF(>15)-17'FV7)- &c. ;
the first series involving all the uneven numbers, and the
second the uneven numbers which contain no squared factor.
   In these theorems the value of r is unrestricted.
   Putting r equal to zero, we see that, if
       F(x) = /(.r) + / V) + /(*») + /(**) + /(.r») + &c.,

    Mobius's Theorem on the Reversion of certain Series.         521

then
            = F(#) - FO3) - F(a») - F(>7) - FC^1) - &c.
   All the results given in this section are due to Mobius,
and in some respects they might be more properly called by
his name than the general theorem in § 3.
             Two-fold application of the Theorem, § 5.
   § 5. It follows from § 3 that, if
   F(a)=/»                     +«,/(*") +ej(x*) +eBf(z»)+ &c.,
then
   f(x)=¥(x)-e3F(xi)-elF(^)-e&F(^) + e9F(a!e)- &c.
   Now suppose
                  f(x)=x + 1}^ + r)3x3 + rjtx* + &c,
where                  ... are quantities of the same nature as
% «sj «4, • • •, viz. 7]3, 7}3, rj6, . . . are independent, and ^»„=
Vm X for all values of m and n.
   We thus have
      F(tf)= x + rj^x2 +7)3x9 + 7)lx*+ &c.
           + e3(;r3+i7ja!8+%a;9 + i71a?11!+ &c.)
where
                 0(a;)=a; + e2ar, + e8a?3 + e(ta;*+ &c. ;
and, applying Mobius's theorem, we find
   ^(a;) = F(a;)-%F(a!2)-%F03)-%F(^)+%F(a:6)- . . .
Whenever, therefore, fix) is of the form x + t/^ + tj^x3 + &c,
we obtain a formula in terms of the F's not only for fix),
but also for another quantity <f>{x) : in fact, since
       Fix) = fix) + e2fia?) + e3fi*3) + ej («*) + &c,
and                    + %<K#2) + VsQiz3) + V$ {&*) + &c->

and            = F(«) -%F(*2)-»j3F(.*3)-%F(^)+ &c.

            The Functions trr(m), A,(n), Sfc, §§ 12, 13.
   § 12. The five functions «r,(n), A,(n), A'(n),Er(n), E/(n),
have been specially considered in the six preceding sections,
because, for certain values of r, they occur as coefficients in
some of the fundamental g-series in Elliptic Functions.
When n is uneven the three functions ar{n), A,(n), A/(n)
become all equal.
   The first of the two formula? in § 6, viz.,
              •,'W-S**G)+S*'(5)-- • • -=wr'
was given by H. J. S. Smith in vol. vii. p. 211 of the ' Pro
ceedings of the London Mathematical Society ' ; but so far
as I know, no special reference has been made to the other
formulae. All the formulae may of course bo established
without the aid of Mobius's theorem ; but the duality of the
results and their connexion with Mobius's theorem seemed to
me to be of interest apart from the results themselves.
   It will be observed that the double result is connected with
the double form of the ^-series in Elliptic Functions. Thus,
taking for example the theorem in § 6, in the case of ml, we
have %1 c,(n).rn
                   sb       2x>    3a?      ix*    .
and, by expanding the terms in rows and summing the
columns, we transform this series into
             x      I    x*     .         |    x* ' \ fa
          (l-*)»+(l-*,),+ (l-*»),+ (l-*)* + M0,
   These two forms of the series correspond to
and
respectively.
   In order to apply Mobius's theorem it is unnecessary to
actually sum the columns of the developed series, as in the
transformation of the ^-series.
   § 13. With reference to the quantities en (and therefore
also T/n), it is to be noticed that they must be such that
              for all values of m and n. Thus, for example, we
cannot put en= ( — l)""1»p, viz. en=nr if n be uneven, and
?„= — nT if n be even, for if e3= — 2r, we must have
                       ei=—2rx -2'= +4'.

528           Mr. J. W. L. Glaisher on Applications of
The series
                 l-x l-J+l-x3                         '
which occurs in Elliptic Functions, is equal to St £.(n)#", where
£.(n) denotes the excess of the sum of the rth powers of the
uneven divisors of n over the sum of the rth powers of the
even divisors of n ; and we thus see that we do not obtain by
Mobius's theorem formula? involving £.(n) corresponding to
those that have been given in the case of Er(n) and E/(n).
   It may be remarked that the functions o-r(n), Ar(n), &c. do
not satisfy the conditions to which en is subject, for the equa
tions ar(m) ar(n)=ar(mn), Ar(w() Ar(«) = A,(mn), &c, hold
good only when m and n are prime to one another.
                   Principle of the Method, §14.
   § 14. The method employed in §§ 6-11 gives a pair of
connected theorems relating to a function P(n), where P(n)
denotes the coefficient of xn in the expansion of F[x) in
ascending powers of x, viz. if

   § 15. In § 3 the expression
                (l-eJS.)(l-ftB») (1-&E.). . Ax^
was considered and found to be equal to 2,e^f(xn), n having all
values of the form arb&C. . .
  We now consider the expression
                  (1-E.)(1-E,)(1-E.)...
               (l-*EB)(l-«E»)(l-fcE.). . /W"

     Mobias's Theorem on the Reversion of certain Series.  529
we see at once that the expression in question is equal to
     /(**)> where
n having the same values as before, and a,b,c,... being the
prime factors of n.
   § 16. If en=n, then
This is the well-known expression for the number of numbers
less than n and prime to it. Adopting Gauss's notation and
denoting this quantity by <f>{n), we thus obtain the result :—
               (1 - 2E8)(1 -3E3)(1 - 5E6). . . /w
        =/(o;) + ^(2y(^) + ^(3)/(^) + ^(4^) + .fee.
   § 17. As a particular case of this theorem, let
we thus find
                (1-Ea)(l-E3)(l-E6)...            x
               (1-2ES)(1-3E3)(1-5E6)... 1-x

and, operating on this series with
                   (1-E1)(1-E,)(1-E,)...,
we obtain as result
               2"<r(n>"-2^ a(n)a?*—X°l a(n)a?"
             -t"(r{n)a?*+t™<T(n)x - &c.

530            Mr. J. W. L. GHaisher on Applications of

    § 18. We have thus found for the expression
                  (1-Ea)(l-E3)(l-E6)...            x
                (1-2E2)(1-3E3)(1-5E6)... 1-x
the three results :—
          (ii.) t°o-(n)xn -2" <r(n)^»-2" ^n)^"- &c,
the first being obtained by operating with the operator as a
whole, the second by operating first with the denominator,
and the third by operating first with the numerator.
    By equating the coefficients of .r" in these three expressions,
we find that
                *(!)+*(/) +*&)+*(*)— +*(»),
and
are each equal to n, where \,f,g,h,                n denote all the
divisors of n.
    The first result, viz. that
                 *(!)+*(/) +*(?)... +*(»)=«,
was given by Gauss in § 39 of the Disguisitiones Arithme
tical. The second result is the particular case r=l of the
second of the two formula? proved in § 6.
    It is curious that two theorems so distinct in character
should be derivable by means of different developments of
the same operator. The symbolic expression for the series
2j <j>(n)f(xn) seems also deserving of notice.
    § 19. It will be observed that the processes of the three
preceding sections are equally applicable if we put e«=nr,

      Mobius's Theorem on the Reversion of certain Series.     531

             Second formula involving 0(re), §§ 20, 21.
    § 20. From the formula proved in § 16 it follows that
            (l-2Es)(l-3E3)(l-5E6)...S^(«)/(^)
                  = (l-Ea)(l-E8)(l-E5).../(*),
and by equating the coefficients of           in this equation we
obtain the formula
          0(w) -S«0@ + ta^ytatc^) + . . .
               =Oor(-l)»
according as n is divisible by a squared factor or is the pro
duct of N simple prime factors. Thus, for example, putting
 »=10, 20 and 30, the formula gives
  0(10) -20(5) -50(2) + 100(1) =1,
   0(20) -20(10) -50(4) + 100(2) =0,
   0(30) -20(15) -30(10) -50(6) + 60(5) + 100(3) + 150(2)
          -300(1) = -1,
 viz.
             4-8- 5 + 10=1,
             8-8-10 + 10=0,
             8-16-12-10 + 24+20 + 15-30= -1.

       0,W-S^)+S^5)-S^J-c)+. . .
           = 0 or (— 1)N, according as n is divisible by a squared
 factor or is the product of N simple prime factors.

   In the first determinant the first row consists of the

if the corresponding number in the first row is the simple
product of an even number of different primes, —1 if it
is the simple product of an uneven number of different
primes, and 0 if it contains a squared factor. The third row is
formed by dividing the numbers in the first row by 2, and
entering, under those which are so divisible, 1, —1, or 0,
according as the quotient consists of the simple product of an
even or uneven number of different primes or contains a squared
factor. The fourth row is formed in the same manner, the
divisor being 3; and so on. The spaces left blank are to be
filled in with ciphers. The number unity is to be regarded as
the product of an even number of primes, i. e. corresponding
to the quotient unity, 1 is to be entered.
   In the second determinant the ciphers and the signs of the
elements are the same as in the first determinant ; but the
actual quotients themselves are entered, and each element in
the first row is replaced by unity.
   Both determinants are of the nth order.

less convenient for purposes of calculation than the systems
of equations which they represent. Indeed, since in order
to form the determinants, it is requisite to divide not only n
but also every number less than n by all its divisors, it is clear
that it would be much simpler to obtain the values of cr(«)

The Advanced Part of a Treatise on the Dynamics of a System of
   Migid Bodies, being Part II. of a Treatise on the ivhole subject; toith
   numerous examples. By E. J. Eouth, DJSc, F.B.S. London :
   Macmillan and Co. 1884. (Pp. xii+343.)
rPHIETY years ago the text-book at Cambridge'on this subject was
     usually a work which was professedly little more than a Syllabus,
consisting of 88 pages of text and 28 pages of examples. It was
expected that the student's reading should be supplemented by oral
teaching both of College lectures and of the private "coach." Now
" the subject is so vast and has so many applications, that a small
book can only be made by omitting or treating imperfectly some of
its details." These are the words of our author, than whom hardly
any one at the present time can speak with greater authority on
this branch of Mathematics.
    The general scope of the treatise in this its " fourth edition,
revised and enlarged," was indicated by us in our notice of the
first part (Phil. Mag. March 1883); and little more is needed than
for us to state what portions of the subject Dr. Eouth has handled
in this second part. These are discussed under thirteen chapters,
respectively headed :—Moving axes and relative motion ; oscilla
 tions about equilibrium, and about a state of motion ; motion of a
 body under the action of no forces and under any forces ; nature
 of the motion given by linear equations, and the conditions of
 stability ; free and forced oscillations : determinations of the con
 stants of integration in terms of the initial conditions ; applications
 of the Calculus of Finite Differences, and of the Calculus of Varia
 tions ; Precession and Nutation ; motion of a string or chain ; and
 motion of a membrane. It will thus be seen that there is much
 new matter; though, on the other hand, there is, of course, much
  which found a place in the third edition ; but in the last-cited
 edition we have 564 pages to set against 385 -|-343 pages in this
 fourth edition. The whole, on perusal, will, however, be found to
 have been carefully recast, and quite a number of illustrative pro
 blems have been added and discussed. The author has not only
  long worked at his subject, but has been working at it up to the
  present date. These recent results, which first saw the light in
  the ' Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society,' have been
  incorporated here, but in a somewhat different guise ; even results
  published so lately as in the closing numbers of the Society's
  present volume of ' Proceedings ' find a place (see p. 243).
    Dr. Eouth has again introduced a few historical notes, which we
 are always pleased to come across in a text-book, and has removed
  from an Appendix to a place in the early part (pp. 108, 109) his
  interesting (" they appear to be new ") properties of the sphero-
  conic or spherical ellipse. In addition we have some illustrations
  from the game of billiards (" to supply some results which may be
  submitted to experiment "), and much light is, by the way, thrown
 upon (if also derived from) numerous branches of Analysis. The
  book appears to be very accurately printed ; at any rate there ar»

 no printers' mistakes which are manifest upon an ordinary exami
 nation, possibly a working student may be able to detect a few
 errata. Should a new edition be called for, it would not now be a
 difficult matter to draw up an index. It gives one an idea of the
 detail with which mathematical subjects are now treated when an
 index to a text-book is suggested as an almost indispensable
 adjunct.

     ON THE ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF WATER DISTILLED
                  IN VACUO. BY F. KOHLRAUSCH.
rPHE question of the electrical conductivity of water is not yet
      settled. By a number of precautions, and by particular care in
the preparation and conservation of water, I succeeded in obtain
ing it with a conductivity at 22° of only 72 billionths of that of
mercury*. But even if this, or an adjacent value, was repeatedly
the lowest attainable limit in various distillations, it could not be
maintained that it really represents the conductivity of water, for
the preparation of perfectly pure water in the ordinary way seems
bound up with insuperable difficulties.
    One of the difficulties consists probably in the influence of air
in the distillation. Just as in rain-water compounds of nitrogen,
hydrogen, and oxygen, for instance nitrite of ammonia, have been
found, so also even in artificial distillation traces of similar
products might occur.
   It is also possible that the mere absorption of air produces the
conductivity or, at all events, increases it. On the same occasion
I showed that electrolytes got their conductivity mainly by ad
mixture, and thus the addition of a gas, even if it itself does not
conduct, might exert an influence. The investigation of this
question with the air-pump failed at that time in consequence of
other errors thereby introduced.
   It is found, in fact, that the distillation of water in vacuum
leads to a far smaller conductivity than that previously found.
   A distilling apparatus in the nature of a water, however, is
comparatively easy to construct. A glass vessel of 100 to 200 c. c.
capacity, which is to serve as retort, is connected by a glass tube
with a smaller vessel, which is provided with two platinized
electrodes, each of about 5 square centimetres surface. The
resistance of the latter vessel, when filled to various heights, was
ascertained by means of an extremely dilute solution of sal am
moniac, the resistance of which was known independently. The
vessels were then carefully washed out.
   By a still open tube the two connected vessels were supplied
with a suitable quantity of what was already very pure water ; the
tube was connected with the mercurial pump, and the water allowed
to boil in its vacuum, and when the boiling ceased it was allowed
to evaporate at a moderate temperature for about a quarter of
an hour, with frequent shaking. Cooled sulphuric acid absorbed

               Intelligence and Miscellaneous Articles.             543
the aqueous vapour. In order to be able to shake the distilling
apparatus with its water briskly, the connexion with the mercurial
air-pump was made in the manner described by Kundt, that is by
means of long bent glass tubes. The supply-tube already men
tioned was hermetically sealed. Mr. Otto Wiegand, of Wurz-
burg, the glass-blower, who had also constructed the double vessel,
gave his experienced help in these operations.
   The vacuum thus obtained I estimate at OO 1 mm. pressure at most.
   There is so much water in the apparatus, that when it is brought
into the larger vessel it is two-thirds full. By using a moderately
warm hot-air bath of 30° to 45°, and a cooling bath between 0°
and — 8°, there being no freezing on account of the heat of con
densation, the requisite quantity of 6 to 8 c. c. was distilled over
into the resistance vessel. This took from 8 to 15 minutes,
according to circumstances.
   The capacity of the two apparatus was only about 0-00002 Sie
mens unit. The water had up to a resistance of 80,000 units.
From the small delicacy of the dynamometer or of the telephone
under these circumstances, alternating currents were not used, but
short separate throws with an extremely sensitive rapidly vibrating
galvanometer in the bridge. Two Smee's elements produced the
current. With careful treatment great electrolytic resistances of
this kind may be determined with sufficient accuracy. The current
is so weak that the polarization requires a few tenths of a second.
By using a varying number of elements, by occasionally reversing
the current, and by varying the duration, an accuracy of one to
two per cent, could be obtained.
   Even in a vacuum the resistance of a distillate was not constant,
but diminished with the time. In one of the vessels this decrease
was even considerable, so that the resistance of a distillate, which
5 minutes after ending the distillation was 660,000 ohms, sank
after 10 minutes to 337,000, in 1 hour to 236,000, in 3 hours to
84,000, and in 15 hours to 26,400, that is           of the first value.
The initial increase of conductivity is almost uniform. Whether
this action is due to the sides of the glass vessel or to the platinum
electrodes, I cannot at present say. In the other vessel the resist
ance decreased more slowly.
   In any case it is necessary to hasten with the measurement of
resistance after the distillation is complete, so that the temperature,
whether judged by the feel or by using a bath, is only approximately
determined.
   Eight different distillations gave the following conducting powers
as compared with mercury, to which are prefixed the temperature
and the number of minutes that have elapsed since the end of the
distillation.

    The experiments lead therefore in all cases to conductivities
 which are not greatly different. The smaller numbers are the
 more important, for no circumstances can be conceived which make
 the conducting power appear too small.
    From the time which elapses during and since the distillation
 the numbers are in any case too large. An impartial consi
 deration would deduce from them for the conductivity of ft*ater
 0-000000000025, or 1/40-milliardth of that of mercury j so that a
 thread of water 1 mm. in length has the same resistance as a thread
 of mercury of the same thickness which encircles the earth.
    According to this the resistance of an ohm is represented by a
 layer of water with a cross section of 1 square millim. and a length
 of about the 26 billionths of a millimetre. The "water-unit of
 resistance"— a column of water a metre in length and a square
millimetre in cross section—has almost a resistance of 4-1010
ohms. To produce the same resistance a copper wire a millimetre
 square must have a length of 24-10" kilometres, a distance which
light would traverse in about 2-2 hours. If a semicircular elec
trode a metre in diameter were sunk in the surface of a large mass
of water, the resistance would amount to about 12,000 ohms.
    A body with so small a conductivity may in many cases be
 considered a non-conductor for voltaic electricity.
    Distillation in vacuo, as described above, has had the very
 satisfactory result of leading by a far simpler method to a con
 ductivity almost one third of that previously found, or, as we may
 say with some justification, to a water three times as pure.
    All that can be maintained with certainty is that the conduc
tivity given above is again an upper limit.—BericAte der Akad. der
 Wissenscfiaften zu Berlin, Oct. 23, 1884.
ON THE COEFFICIENT OF FRICTION OF GASES AND VAPOURS, AND
   THEIR DEPENDENCE ON TEMPERATURE. BY O. SCHUMANN.
   The conclusions drawn by the author from a long series of
experiments are as follows :—
    1. Maxwell's formula gives, for a different arrangement of the
experiments, values for the coefficient at friction which show greater
deviations from each other than would correspond to errors of
observation, and this is particularly the case with high temperatures.
   2. By introducing a correction into Maxwell's formula, numbers
are obtained which, at ordinary temperature, exhibit a close agree
ment with the method of transpiration.
   3. Owing to absorption, the method of transpiration gives too
high values of the coefficient of friction. With vapours the values
are too small for the same reason.
   4. The dependence of the coefficient of friction on the tempera
ture increases with the temperature.
   5. The coefficients of all the vapours examined by me have almost
the same function of temperature.
   6. The relation found by Puluj to exist between length of path
and refractive index holds for the vapours of homologous ethers at
corresponding temperatures.—Wiedemann's Annalen, Nov. 1884.
